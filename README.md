## 🌟 What Is Penance?

Penance is a **tactical mech combat card game** where:

- **Your deck is your HP** - Damage discards cards, deck empty = death spiral
- **Components get destroyed** - Lose your Right Arm, lose all weapon cards permanently
- **10 asymmetric factions** - Each plays completely differently (vampires, elves, merchants, cultists)
- **Positioning matters** - Hex combat with facing, flanking, elevation, and line of sight
- **Brutal consequences** - Permanent pilot scars, component destruction, death

**Setting**: Medieval fantasy world where warriors pilot baroque mechs called **Caskets** - towering war machines controlled through neural interface, seeking absolution through combat.

### Advanced 6 Factions

| Faction | Playstyle | Signature Mechanic |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **[Wyrd Conclave](https://keebergoblin.github.io/penance/codex/faction-fae.html)** | Reality Bender | Wyrd Tokens (steal faces, distort reality) |
| **[Nomad Collective](https://keebergoblin.github.io/penance/codex/faction-nomads.html)** | Mobile Survivor | Improvisation (salvaged gear, mobility) |
| **[The Exchange](https://keebergoblin.github.io/penance/codex/faction-exchange.html)** | Economic Warfare | Credit Tokens (bribery, mercenaries) |

## 🔧 Core Mechanics

### Deck-as-HP System
- **Your 30-card deck IS your HP** - Damage = discard from deck
- Deck empty → Reshuffle + add 1 **Damage card** (blank dead draw)
- Multiple reshuffles → Death spiral of useless cards

### Component Damage (Kingdom Death-inspired)
- **5 Components**: Head (8 HP), Torso (10 HP), Arms (8 HP each), Legs (10 HP)
- Damage tracked across **3 zones**: AP Zone → Structure Zone → Pilot Exposure
- **Component destroyed** = lose all associated cards **permanently**
- Example: Right Arm destroyed → All Primary Weapon cards become SCRAP

### SP Action Economy
- **Soul Points (SP)** refresh each turn (4-6 depending on faction)
- Spend up to max safely, or **overspend to 1.5× max** for burst turns (risks Heat Strain)
- **Variable Draw Phase**: Draw (cards played ÷ 2), minimum 2, maximum 5

### Salvage System
- **Discard 2 SCRAP → Draw 1 card** (0 SP, Free Action)
- Component destruction converts equipment into SCRAP
- Strategic dilemma: Keep SCRAP for damage absorption vs. cycle for useful cards
- **Warning**: 2-for-1 accelerates death spiral

### Tactical Hex Combat
- **Hex-based positioning** with facing modifiers (Front/Side/Rear Arc)
- **Rear Arc attacks**: +2 damage
- **Elevation**, **cover**, and **line of sight** all matter
- **Flanking** and **high ground advantage**

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Core Pillars
- **Brutal Progression** - Permanent consequences (component destruction, pilot death, scars)
- **Asymmetric Factions** - Each faction plays completely differently
- **Meaningful Scarcity** - Resources are precious (Salvage economy, equipment slots)
- **Death Spiral** - Inevitable decline (Damage cards accumulate, components destroyed)
- **Tactical Depth** - Positioning, facing, elevation, component targeting all matter
- **Mystery Over Answers** - Lore raises questions (What is the Theslar Engine?)
- **No Pure Heroes** - Every faction is morally complex

### Design Influences
- **GKR: Heavy Hitters** - Deck-as-HP, SP economy
- **Kingdom Death: Monster** - Component destruction, permanent consequences, AI behavior decks
- **BattleTech/MechWarrior** - Component targeting, heat management, customization
- **Into the Breach** - Positioning-first tactical combat
- **Escaflowne** - Mystical power + mechanical armor, baroque aesthetic
