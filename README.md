## Overview

**Penance: Absolution Through Steel** combines the tactical positioning of **GKR: Heavy Hitters** with the brutal progression of **Kingdom Death: Monster**. Pilot massive armored suits called **Caskets** as you fight for redemption in a dark medieval fantasy world 437 years after the apocalypse.

### Core Pillars
- **Deck-as-HP System**: Your 30-card deck IS your HP - discard cards when damaged
- **Tactical Hex Combat**: Positioning, facing modifiers, elevation, and terrain matter
- **Component Destruction**: Kingdom Death-style permanent damage (3 Component Damage = destroyed)
- **SP Action Economy**: Play multiple cards per turn, manage Safe Zone vs Danger Zone
- **Faction Asymmetry**: Each faction plays completely differently
- **Death Spiral**: Deck reshuffle adds blank Damage cards - inevitability of decline

---

## Key Mechanics

### Deck-as-HP
- **30 cards = 30 HP** (Dwarves: 32 with Stone Endurance)
- Take damage → Discard cards from top of deck
- Deck empty → Reshuffle discard pile + add 1 **Damage card** (blank dead draw)
- Multiple reshuffles → Multiple Damage cards → Death spiral

### Component Damage (KDM-Inspired)
When you discard **Primary Weapon cards** from damage:
- 1 Primary Weapon card = 1 Component Damage
- Track by location: Right Arm, Left Arm, Legs, Head, Chassis
- **3 Component Damage = Component Destroyed**
- **Destroyed Right Arm** → Lose all Primary Weapon cards from hand (permanent)

### SP Economy
Each turn you refresh your Soul Points (SP) to maximum:
- **Safe Zone**: Spend up to max SP without risk
- **Danger Zone**: Push beyond max for +2 SP, but risk Strain damage
- Use SP to play cards, move, and attack

### Facing & Positioning
- **Rear Arc**: +2 damage to attacker
- **Side Arc**: +1 damage to attacker
- **Front Arc**: Full Defense
- High ground, cover, and flanking all matter

### Faction Asymmetry

**Church of Absolution** (Aggressive Martyr):
- Discard your own cards for burst damage
- Scales with component destruction (gets stronger as wounded)
- High-risk, high-reward martyrdom playstyle

**Dwarven Clans** (Fortress Defender):
- Rune Counters stack for massive damage reduction
- Armor-piercing attacks ignore defense buffs
- 32 HP deck (Stone Endurance racial ability)
- Attrition warfare and durability
