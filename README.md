## Overview

**Penance: Absolution Through Steel** combines the tactical positioning of GKR: Heavy Hitters with the brutal progression and AI systems of Kingdom Death: Monster, wrapped in a deck-building framework. Pilot massive armored suits called **Caskets** powered by corrupting **Soulstones** as you fight for redemption in a dark medieval fantasy world.

### Core Pillars
- **Tactical Hex-Based Combat**: Positioning matters - facing, range, and terrain affect every decision
- **Deck-Building**: Your deck IS your Casket - each card represents equipment, actions, and battle damage
- **Push-Your-Luck Action Economy**: Safe operations or risk everything for more Soul-Points
- **Corruption System**: Power comes at a price - Soulstones grant strength but corrupt your pilot
- **Campaign Progression**: Persistent pilots, permanent injuries, workshop upgrades, and brutal consequences

---

## Game Modes

- **Arena (PvP)**: 1v1, 2v2, or FFA competitive battles
- **Campaign (Co-op)**: Story-driven progression with persistent characters
- **Raid (Boss Fight)**: Team up against massive AI-controlled monsters
- **Skirmish (Mixed)**: Objective-based gameplay with mission decks

| Class | Weight | Soul-Points | Movement Focus |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|

| **Support** | 900-1,200 lbs | 4 SP | Team Buffs & Repairs |
| **Heavy** | 1,300-1,800 lbs | 3 SP | Armor & Sustained Fire |

## Key Mechanics

### Soul-Point (SP) System
Each Casket has a **Safe Zone** of Soul-Points they can spend per turn without consequence. Push into the **Danger Zone** for +2 SP, but risk rolling on the Strain Table - overheating, system failures, or worse.

### Soulstone Corruption
The crystalline hearts that power Caskets grant immense strength but accumulate **Taint**. Higher corruption unlocks forbidden abilities but risks transforming you into an Abomination.

### Directional Combat
Attacks from different hex facings have different effects:
- Shield arcs provide bonus defense
- Rear attacks are devastating
- Positioning is survival

### Monster AI Behavior Decks
Kingdom Death-inspired AI system - monsters have behavior decks that create unpredictable, emergent combat scenarios.
