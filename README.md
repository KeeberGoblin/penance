## Overview

**Penance: Absolution Through Steel** combines the tactical positioning of **GKR: Heavy Hitters** with the brutal progression of **Kingdom Death: Monster**, wrapped in a deck-as-HP framework. Pilot massive armored suits called **Caskets** powered by corrupting **Soulstones** as you fight for redemption in a dark medieval fantasy world.

### Core Pillars
- **Deck-as-HP System**: Your 30-card deck IS your HP - discard cards when damaged
- **Tactical Hex Combat**: Positioning, facing modifiers, elevation, and terrain matter
- **Component Destruction**: Kingdom Death-style permanent damage (3 hits = destroyed)
- **SP Action Economy**: Play multiple cards per turn, manage Heat vs Strain
- **Faction Asymmetry**: Church (self-harm martyrdom) vs Dwarves (armor-piercing defense)
- **Death Spiral**: Reshuffle adds Damage cards - inevitability of decline

---

## Key Mechanics

### Deck-as-HP
- **30 cards = 30 HP** (Dwarves: 32 with Stone Endurance)
- Take damage â†’ Discard cards from top of deck
- Deck empty â†’ Reshuffle discard pile + add 1 **Damage card** (blank dead draw)
- Multiple reshuffles â†’ Multiple Damage cards â†’ Death spiral

### Component Damage (KDM-Inspired)
When you discard **Primary Weapon cards** from damage:
- 1 Primary Weapon card = 1 Component Damage
- Track by location: Right Arm, Left Arm, Legs, Head, Chassis
- **3 Component Damage = Component Destroyed**
- **Destroyed Right Arm** â†’ Lose all Primary Weapon cards from hand (permanent)

### SP Economy (GKR-Inspired)
- **Refresh Phase**: Restore SP to maximum (5 for Medium frames)
- **Action Phase**: Play cards (costs SP), move (1 SP per hex), attack
- **Safe Zone**: Spend up to max SP without penalty
- **Danger Zone**: Spend beyond max for +2 SP, but roll Strain check (5+ Heat)
- **Strain failures**: Lose SP, take damage, component malfunctions

### Facing Modifiers
- **Rear Arc**: +2 damage (attacker), -2 Defense (defender)
- **Side Arc**: +1 damage, -1 Defense
- **Front Arc**: +0 damage, full Defense
- Positioning matters - flank for advantage

### Faction Asymmetry

**Church of Absolution** (Aggressive Martyr):
- **Blood Offering**: Discard 2 cards â†’ +3 damage + ignore 1 Armor (0 SP!)
- **Righteous Fury**: +1 damage per component destroyed (scales)
- **Crusader's Vow**: Attacks cost -1 SP while â‰¥20 HP
- **Playstyle**: Burst damage, self-harm for power, aggressive positioning

**Dwarven Clans** (Fortress Defender):
- **Rune Counters**: Stack to 3 â†’ reduce all damage by 3
- **Crushing Blow**: Armor-piercing (ignore all defense buffs)
- **Stone Endurance**: 32 HP instead of 30 (2 extra cards)
- **Unbreakable Spirit**: Resurrect once per mission
- **Playstyle**: Attrition warfare, durability, armor-piercing counters
