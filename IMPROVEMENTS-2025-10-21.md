## 1. ‚úÖ Ossuarium Faction Documentation Expansion

### Problem

### Solution
Expanded documentation from **152 to 513 lines** to match depth of other factions.

### Added Sections
1. **Casket Classes & Equipment Slots** (4 casket types: Revenant, Wraith, Lich, Tomb Lord)
2. **Sample Builds** (4 complete builds with equipment, tactics, and strategies)
3. **Faction Tactics** (5 tactics: Necrotic Surge, Death's Patience, Legion Command, Inevitable Death, Grave Resurrection)
4. **Faction Strengths** (7 key strengths with v5.29 balance notes)
5. **Tactical Tips** (Early/Mid/Late game strategies)
6. **Counter-Play** (How opponents should fight Ossuarium)
7. **Campaign Progression** (Starting/Mid/Late campaign loadouts)
8. **Optional Rules** (Taint Exploitation interactions, Pilot Grit System)

### Impact
Ossuarium now has the same comprehensive tactical guidance as Church, Dwarves, Elves, etc.

## 2. ‚úÖ "The Soulstone Exchange" ‚Üí "The Exchange" Naming Fix

### Problem
**9 files** still referenced the old faction name "Soulstone Exchange" instead of the current "The Exchange".

### Files Fixed
1. [docs/factions/index.md](docs/factions/index.md) - Faction listing
2. [docs/factions/exchange/support-units.md](docs/factions/exchange/support-units.md) - Support units header
3. [docs/cards/README.md](docs/cards/README.md) - Card database reference
4. [docs/factions/wyrd-conclave/deck-equipment-system.md](docs/factions/wyrd-conclave/deck-equipment-system.md) - Faction relations table
5. [docs/codex/lore-settlements.html](docs/codex/lore-settlements.html) - Settlement descriptions
6. [docs/codex/README.md](docs/codex/README.md) - Codex index
7. [docs/codex/faction-bloodlines.html](docs/codex/faction-bloodlines.html) - Navigation links
8. [docs/codex/campaign-settlement-phase.html](docs/codex/campaign-settlement-phase.html) - Campaign mechanics
9. [docs/codex/support-equipment.html](docs/codex/support-equipment.html) - Equipment tables
10. [docs/codex/faction-nomads.html](docs/codex/faction-nomads.html) - Navigation links

### Impact
Complete naming consistency across entire repository.

## 3. ‚úÖ Church "Great Schism" Lore Contradiction Resolved

### Problem
[docs/lore/world-overview.md](docs/lore/world-overview.md) mentioned "Church of Absolution splits in the Great Schism (Year 134)" but:
- No other documents mentioned this schism
- No explanation of who split or why
- Church appears unified in all game materials

### Solution
Changed line to: **"Church of Absolution consolidates doctrine after internal reforms (Year 134)"**

### Impact
- Clarified as minor internal reform, not faction split
- Maintains Church as unified faction
- Removes unexplained lore contradiction

---

## 4. ‚úÖ Ossuarium Faction Description Updated

### Problem
[docs/factions/index.md](docs/factions/index.md) still described Ossuarium with **outdated v5.21 lifesteal mechanics**:
- "Playstyle: Lifesteal vampire with resurrections"
- "Mechanic: Soul Harvest triggers, Decay cards, death rewards"

### Solution
Updated to **v5.29-FINAL Taint warfare mechanics**:
- "Playstyle: Taint corruption necromancer with resurrections"
- "Mechanic: Decay Aura (spread Taint), Phylactery (resurrection), Skeletal Thralls, attrition warfare"
- "Status: ‚úÖ Complete with v5.29-FINAL (v2.0 equipment system + Taint warfare)"

### Impact
Faction index now accurately reflects current game mechanics.

---

## 5. ‚úÖ Backup Files Archived

### Problem
Two large backup files cluttering main documentation:
- `docs/cards/complete-card-data.json.backup` (448 KB)
- `docs/factions/ossuarium/deck-equipment-system.md.backup` (18 KB)

### Solution
Created [docs/archive-backups-2025-10-21/](docs/archive-backups-2025-10-21/) directory and moved backups with README.md documenting:
- Original locations
- Purpose of each backup
- Why they were superseded
- Restoration instructions if needed

### Impact
Cleaner repository structure, backups preserved for historical reference.

---

## 6. ‚úÖ MISSING-EQUIPMENT-DESIGN.md Status Updated

### Problem
[docs/archive-v5-history/MISSING-EQUIPMENT-DESIGN.md](docs/archive-v5-history/MISSING-EQUIPMENT-DESIGN.md) had status "Implementation Pending" but equipment had been implemented.

### Solution
Updated status to **"‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (Archived - Historical Design Document)"** with note:
- Nomads: NOMADS_SCIMITAR, NOMADS_COMPOSITE_BOW
- Vestige-Bloodlines: BLOODLINES_PRIMARY_WEAPON, BLOODLINES_SECONDARY_EQUIPMENT
- Wyrd-Conclave: WYRD_PRIMARY_WEAPON, WYRD_SECONDARY_EQUIPMENT

### Impact
Archive folder now accurately reflects implementation status.

---

## 7. ‚úÖ Lore Contradiction Report Updated

### Problem
[docs/reference/lore-contradiction-report.md](docs/reference/lore-contradiction-report.md) listed fixes as "PARTIALLY FIXED" or "NEEDS CLARIFICATION".

### Solution
Updated status for 2 critical contradictions to **"‚úÖ FIXED (October 21, 2025)"** with details of resolution.

### Impact
Contradiction report now serves as accurate historical record of lore improvements.
