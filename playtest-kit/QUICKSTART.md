# PENANCE: QUICK START RULES
**15-Minute Combat Guide** • Alpha Playtest Kit

---

## WHAT IS PENANCE?

Tactical mech combat where **your deck is your HP**. Every card you discard = damage taken. Lose your weapon cards? You're crippled. Brutal, desperate, unforgettable.

---

## SETUP (2 minutes)

**Each player needs:**
- ✅ 1 Pre-built pilot deck (30 cards) → see included decks
- ✅ 1 Pilot sheet to track damage
- ✅ 2d6 Attack Dice (or regular d6 if no custom dice)
- ✅ 1d6 Defense Die per damage point (or regular d6)
- ✅ Tokens for Heat/SP tracking

**The Battlefield:**
- Use hex grid map OR theater-of-mind with range bands
- Start pilots 8 hexes apart
- Add 2-3 terrain features (walls, rubble)

---

## YOUR DECK = YOUR HP

**30 cards total:**
- 10 Universal (movement, defense, utility)
- 12 Primary Weapon (faction-specific attacks)
- 6 Secondary Equipment (shields, tools)
- 2 Faction Tactics (special abilities)

**Start with:**
- Full 30-card deck (face-down)
- Draw 6 cards into hand
- 6 SP (Skill Points) to spend per turn

---

## TURN STRUCTURE (30 seconds per turn)

### 1. REFRESH PHASE
- Reset SP to maximum (6 for Light Caskets, 5 for Medium, 4 for Heavy)
- Check Heat (if 5+, roll Strain - see Heat section)

### 2. ACTION PHASE (Spend SP)
Play cards from hand:
- **Movement** (1-2 SP): Move 2-4 hexes
- **Attacks** (2-4 SP): Deal damage to enemies
- **Defense** (0-1 SP): Reactive cards (play when hit)
- **Utilities** (1-2 SP): Draw cards, remove Heat, support allies

**SP Management:** When you run out of SP, your turn ends.

### 3. DRAW PHASE
Draw 2 cards at end of turn (hand back to 6 max)

---

## COMBAT RESOLUTION (The Core Loop)

### ATTACKING

**Step 1:** Declare target, which attack card, which component (Right Arm, Left Arm, Legs, Head, Chassis)

**Step 2:** Calculate To-Hit Number
- Base: **5+** (roll 2d6, add them up)
- **+1** if you moved this turn
- **+1** if target moved last turn
- **+1** if attacking front/shield-side
- **-1** if attacking rear/flank (easier!)

**Step 3:** Roll 2d6 Attack Dice
- **5-6 total** = Hit (standard damage)
- **7-8 total** = Strong Hit (+1 damage)
- **9-10 total** = Critical Hit (+2 damage, bypass 1 Defense)
- **Below target** = MISS

### DEFENDING

**Step 1:** Defender rolls **1d6 Defense Die per damage point**

**Step 2:** Count results:
- **SHIELD/ABSORB** = Block 1 damage
- **BLOOD** = Take damage (no effect)
- **CRITICAL** = Take damage + 1 Component Damage
- **HEAT** = Take damage + gain 1 Heat
- **PIERCE** = Take damage, can't use reactive cards

**Step 3:** Apply final damage
- Discard cards equal to damage (your choice: from hand OR deck top)
- Track Component Damage (see below)

---

## COMPONENT DAMAGE (The Brutal Part)

**When you discard Primary Weapon cards from damage:**
- Mark 1 Component Damage per card to targeted location
- **3 Component Damage = Component DESTROYED**

**Destroyed Effects:**
- **Right Arm:** Can't use Primary Weapon cards (you're disarmed!)
- **Left Arm:** Can't use Secondary Equipment (shield/tools gone)
- **Legs:** Movement costs +1 SP per hex (crippled)
- **Head:** -1 to ranged attacks (sensors offline)
- **Chassis:** -1 SP maximum permanently (core damaged)

**This is the death spiral.** Once crippled, you're desperate.

---

## HEAT SYSTEM (Push Your Luck)

**Gain Heat from:**
- Overextending (extra movement)
- Taking certain damage types
- Using powerful attacks

**Heat Zones:**
- **0-4 Heat:** Safe
- **5-7 Heat:** Roll Strain at turn start (1d6, on 1-2 = lose 1 SP)
- **8+ Heat:** Roll Strain with +1 penalty, risk shutting down

**Remove Heat:** Play "Emergency Vent" (2 SP, remove 3 Heat) or "Breathe the Core" (1 SP, remove 1 Heat + draw 1 card)

---

## DECK DEPLETION (Running Out of HP)

**When you need to draw but deck is empty:**
1. Shuffle discard pile into new deck
2. **Add 1 "Damage" card** (dead draw) to the deck
3. Draw normally

**After 3-4 reshuffles:** Your deck is 30% useless cards. Death spiral accelerates.

**When deck AND discard are empty:** You're **DEFEATED**

---

## WINNING CONDITIONS

**Arena Match (1v1):**
- First to deplete opponent's deck wins
- Component destruction is a route to victory

**Team Battle:**
- Last team standing wins

**Mission Objective:**
- Varies (hold position, eliminate target, escape)

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

## COMMON MISTAKES (Learn from These!)

❌ **Forgetting to draw** at end of turn → You starve for options
❌ **Playing too aggressively** → You take massive damage early
❌ **Not tracking Component Damage** → Suddenly your arm is gone
❌ **Discarding from deck thoughtlessly** → You might lose key cards

✅ **Do This Instead:**
- Balance aggression with defense
- Discard strategically (hand vs deck)
- Protect your Primary Weapon cards when possible
- Use Heat management cards before hitting 5+ Heat

---

## FIRST GAME TIPS

**Turn 1:** Move into range (4-6 hexes), probe with basic attack
**Turn 2-3:** Aggressive trades, use Feint/buffs before big attacks
**Turn 4+:** Adapt to Component Damage, play around what's broken

**If you're winning:** Press advantage, force bad discards
**If you're losing:** Desperate plays, use Faction Tactics, go for broke

---

## WHAT'S NOT IN THIS QUICK START

- Campaign rules (settlements, pilot progression)
- Full equipment customization
- Loot and crafting
- Advanced tactics and combos
- Scenario objectives beyond "defeat opponent"
