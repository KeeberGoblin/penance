- Subsequent games: 20-30 minutes

---

## GETTING STARTED (3 Steps)

### STEP 1: Read the Quick Start (15 minutes)
Open `QUICKSTART.md` and read through the core rules. Focus on:
- Deck = HP concept
- Turn structure (Refresh → Action → Draw)
- Combat resolution (Attack → Defense → Damage)
- Component Damage tracking

### STEP 2: Pick Pre-Built Decks (2 minutes)
Each player chooses one deck from `/decks/`:
- **Church Confessor** - Aggressive martyr, self-harm for burst
- **Dwarven Ironclad** - Tank, armor stacking, sustained damage
- **Elven Warden** - Mobile skirmisher, range + control
- **Nomad Outrider** - Ultra-mobile striker, hit-and-run

Print or use digital reference.

### STEP 3: Play Proving Grounds (30-45 minutes)
- Use `SCENARIO-PROVING-GROUNDS.md` for setup
- Start 8 hexes apart (or use distance bands if no hex map)
- Print `PILOT-SHEET.md` for each player (track damage)
- Keep `COMBAT-FLOWCHART.md` handy for reference

**You're ready to play!**

## WHAT YOU NEED

### REQUIRED:
- ✅ 2 players
- ✅ This playtest kit (printed or digital)
- ✅ Tokens for tracking (poker chips, coins, beads):
  - SP tokens (6-10 per player)
  - Heat tokens (10 per player)
  - Component Damage tokens (15 per player)
- ✅ Dice:
  - 2d6 per player (for attacks)
  - 6-10d6 per player (for defense)
  - **OR** use dice roller app
- ✅ Pilot tracking sheets (print `PILOT-SHEET.md`)

### OPTIONAL BUT HELPFUL:
- ☐ Hex grid map (16×12) or battlemat
- ☐ Miniatures or tokens for pilots
- ☐ Custom attack/defense dice (if you have them)
- ☐ Index cards or deck of cards (to represent your 30-card deck)
- ☐ Dry-erase markers (for tracking)

### ALTERNATIVE: THEATER-OF-MIND
If you don't have a hex map:
- Use **range bands**: Close (0-3), Medium (4-6), Long (7+)
- Track relative positions ("I'm behind the wall, 5 hexes from you")
- Describe terrain features verbally

## PRINTING GUIDE

### Minimum Print (Play Immediately):
1. `QUICKSTART.md` (4 pages)
2. `PILOT-SHEET.md` × 2 (one per player)
3. One deck reference (e.g., `CHURCH-CONFESSOR.md`)

**Total:** ~7-8 pages

### Full Print (Complete Kit):
1. All files in this folder
2. All 4 deck references

**Total:** ~20 pages

### Digital-Only Option:
- Keep files open on phone/tablet during play
- Use digital dice roller
- Track damage on paper or app

---

## HOW TO USE THE DECKS

### PHYSICAL CARDS (Recommended):
1. Write each card name on index cards (30 per deck)
2. Shuffle into deck
3. Draw 6 cards to hand
4. Play cards as normal

**Time to Prep:** 20 minutes per deck

### DIGITAL REFERENCE (Faster):
1. Keep deck list open on phone/tablet
2. Use generic playing cards (Ace-6 in 5 suits)
3. Reference digital list when you draw
4. Track discards separately

**Time to Prep:** 2 minutes

### SIMPLIFIED (Fastest):
1. Just use the deck reference as a menu
2. Don't shuffle - declare which card you're playing
3. Track HP with tokens/dice
4. Focus on learning mechanics, not card management

**Time to Prep:** 0 minutes (just play)
