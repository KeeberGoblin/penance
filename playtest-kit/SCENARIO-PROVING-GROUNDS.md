## TURN-BY-TURN PACING GUIDE

### **Round 1: APPROACH**
- Move into range (4-6 hexes)
- Probe with basic attack
- Test opponent's defensive cards
- **Goal:** Positioning, information gathering

### **Round 2-3: ENGAGEMENT**
- Trade damage aggressively
- Use terrain for advantage
- Begin Component Damage tracking
- **Goal:** Establish board control

### **Round 4-5: ESCALATION**
- Deploy faction tactics (Blood Offering, Runic Armor, etc.)
- Fight for Altar control (free healing)
- Component destruction becomes critical
- **Goal:** Press advantage or stabilize if behind

### **Round 6+: DESPERATION**
- Low deck counts (15 cards or less)
- All-in plays, use Faction Tactics
- Avoid reshuffling if possible (Damage cards accumulate)
- **Goal:** Finish opponent before deck depletion

## POST-GAME DEBRIEFING

### What to Track for Feedback:
- ☐ Which faction felt stronger?
- ☐ How many rounds did the game last?
- ☐ Which Component was destroyed first?
- ☐ Did Heat matter?
- ☐ How many reshuffles occurred?
- ☐ Which cards felt overpowered/underpowered?
- ☐ Was the pacing fun (too fast/slow)?

### Common First-Game Issues:
- **Forgot to draw 2 cards at end of turn** → Starved for options
- **Didn't track Component Damage** → Missed destroyed components
- **Played too aggressively early** → Depleted deck by Round 4
- **Ignored Heat management** → Shut down from Strain

---

## VARIANT: TEAM BATTLE (2v2)

**Setup:** 4 pilots, 2 per team, start in opposite corners
**Special Rule:** Allies can use support cards on each other
**Victory:** Eliminate both enemy pilots

**Recommended Teams:**
- Church + Dwarves (Tank + Martyr)
- Elves + Nomads (Range + Mobility)
