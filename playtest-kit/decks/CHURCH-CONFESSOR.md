## QUICK REFERENCE

**Your Strengths:**
- ✅ Massive burst damage (Blood Offering + Execute = 10+ damage)
- ✅ Fast movement (6 SP = high mobility)
- ✅ Ally protection (Martyrdom Protocol, Interpose)
- ✅ Self-sacrifice playstyle

**Your Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Self-destruct mechanics (Blood Offering hurts YOU)
- ❌ Low HP pool (Scout frame = fragile)
- ❌ Heat management issues (Martyrdom Protocol generates Heat)

**Turn 1 Opening:**
1. Play **Blood Offering** (0 SP) - Discard 2 cards from deck
2. Play **Desperate Lunge** (1 SP) - Move 2 hexes toward enemy
3. Play **Cleaving Strike** (3 SP) - Now deals 5 + 3 (Blood Offering) + ignores Defense = 8 damage, easier to hit!
4. You have 2 SP left - Save for reactive defense or pass

**Mid-Game Strategy:**
- Use Buckler Blocks to stay alive while dealing damage
- Save Blood Offering for critical kills (execute wounded enemies)
- Martyrdom Protocol if ally about to die (YOU take hit instead)
- Manage Heat with Emergency Vent or Breathe the Core

**Late Game:**
- If low on HP (15 cards left), play conservatively
- Use Execution Blow to finish wounded enemies
- Penitent's Wrath for desperate all-in (self-harm for massive damage)
- Die gloriously if it wins the fight
