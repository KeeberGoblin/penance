## PLAYSTYLE

**Strengths:** Highest Defense, sustained damage, Component Damage resistant, punishes aggression
**Weaknesses:** Slow (4 SP), low mobility, vulnerable to kiting, Heat builds up

**Opening:** Advance 2 hexes, Fortify (+2 Defense), wait for enemy to engage
**Mid-Game:** Trade favorably (your Defense mitigates damage), Ground Slam groups
**Late-Game:** Grind them down, Runic Armor keeps you alive when deck thins

**Component Tracker & Heat:** Same as Church
