## DECKBUILDING TIPS

### DO:
- ✅ **Match mission type** - Boss = execute cards, Swarm = AoE cards
- ✅ **Counter opponent** - Tank vs burst, mobility vs control
- ✅ **Synergize with team** - Don't all pick damage, need support
- ✅ **Consider SP costs** - Balance cheap (1-2 SP) and expensive (4+ SP) cards

### DON'T:
- ❌ **Ignore passives** - Passive cards are ALWAYS active (free value!)
- ❌ **Pick all expensive cards** - You'll run out of SP
- ❌ **Pick no defensive cards** - You need survival tools
- ❌ **Copy your opponent** - Adapt, don't mirror

### QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. **What's the win condition?** (Burst down? Outlast? Support carry?)
2. **What's my team composition?** (Need tank? DPS? Support?)
3. **What's the mission?** (1v1 Arena? Boss? Swarm clear?)
4. **What's my SP economy?** (Scout 6 SP vs Heavy 4 SP changes builds)

## PRE-BUILT DECKS vs CUSTOM BUILDS

**For First Game:** Use pre-built decks (already optimized)
**After 1-2 Games:** Try custom builds (swap 2-3 cards)
**Experienced:** Full custom (choose all 6 from scratch)

**Pre-builts** (see `/playtest-kit/decks/`):
- Church Confessor - uses Blood Offering + Martyrdom Protocol loadout
- Dwarven Ironclad - uses Runic Armor + Earthshaker loadout
- Elven Warden - uses Forest Step + Verdant Wrath loadout
- Nomad Outrider - uses Ghost Step + Survivor's Instinct loadout
