# PENANCE: Expansion 3 - Evolution

**Requires:** Core Box
**Recommended:** Expansions 1 & 2 (for full experience)

## Release Contents

### 2 New Playable Factions (Most Complex)

#### Vestige Bloodlines (Mutation Specialists)
**Playstyle:** Adaptive mutation with extinction clock

**Core Mechanic:** Biomass Tokens + 5 Bloodline Variants
- **5 Bloodlines:** Lupine (speed), Ursine (tank), Serpentine (poison), Avian (aerial), Insectoid (swarm)
- **Biomass Evolution:** Spend tokens to mutate mid-battle
- **Extinction Clock:** Limited population, permanent death
- **Adaptive Biology:** Change form based on threat

**Complexity:** Very High
- 5 completely different playstyles in one faction
- Requires understanding ALL Core Box mechanics
- Mutation tree planning
- Extinction risk management

**Support Units:** 6 units
- Feral Pack
- Regenerators
- Titan-Strain
- Void-Touched
- Alpha Mutant
- Hive Mother

**Strengths:**
- Ultimate adaptability (counter any strategy)
- Biomass mutation = mid-battle flexibility
- 5 bloodlines = 5 different win conditions
- Regeneration (recover cards)

**Weaknesses:**
- Extinction Clock (permadeath risk in campaign)
- Complex decision trees
- Vulnerable during mutation (1 turn delay)
- Requires deep game knowledge

**Lore:** The last survivors of pre-Sundering genetic experiments. Five bloodlines, each holding fragments of animal DNA. They evolve to survive. But evolution is slow. Extinction is fast.

#### Emergent Syndicate (Hive Mind Swarm)
**Playstyle:** Coordinated collective consciousness

**Core Mechanic:** Metamorph Tokens + Hive Mind
- **Hive Coordination:** All units act as one organism
- **Metamorph Evolution:** Choose evolutionary paths
- **Swarm Tactics:** More units = exponential power
- **Collective Memory:** Learn from defeats

**Complexity:** High
- Requires managing multiple units simultaneously
- Coordination-dependent
- Evolutionary path planning
- Swarm positioning

**Support Units:** 6 units
- Swarm Drones (cheap, expendable)
- Metamorphs (evolving soldiers)
- Hive Node (coordination hub)
- Collective Mind (psychic core)
- Swarm Nexus (spawn point)
- Overmind (apex intelligence)

**Strengths:**
- Exponential scaling (swarm power)
- Shared consciousness (no friendly fire)
- Metamorph adaptability
- Overwhelming numbers

**Weaknesses:**
- Weak individual units
- Dependent on Hive Node survival
- Slow start (needs buildup time)
- Vulnerable to AOE damage

**Lore:** They are not individuals. They are We. The Emergent Syndicate is a collective consciousness born from the Engine's radiation. Every drone is a neuron. Every death is a lesson. They do not fear extinction—they ARE extinction.

## Teaching the Expansion

### Teaching Vestige Bloodlines
1. **Start with ONE bloodline** (recommend Lupine for simplicity)
2. Explain Biomass Token economy
3. Show mutation examples (cost vs benefit)
4. Warn: "This faction has 5 playstyles—master one first"
5. **Campaign Only:** Explain Extinction Clock consequences

### Teaching Emergent Syndicate
1. Start with 3 Swarm Drones + 1 Metamorph
2. Demonstrate Hive Node importance (kill it = crippled)
3. Show swarm attack coordination
4. Explain evolution paths (choose 1 per game)
5. Emphasize: "Weak alone, unstoppable together"

## Playstyle Comparison

| Faction | Adaptability | Complexity | Win Condition |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| **Vestige Bloodlines** | Ultimate (5 forms) | Very High | Counter-evolve opponent |
| **Emergent Syndicate** | High (metamorph) | High | Swarm overwhelming |

---

## Campaign Integration

### Vestige Bloodlines: Extinction Clock
- **Starting Population:** 50 individuals
- **Death = Permanent:** Each Bloodline member death reduces population
- **Extinction Threshold:** 10 population remaining
- **Breeding Rate:** 1d3 births per settlement phase (IF population > 20)
- **Consequences:** At 0 population, Bloodlines are EXTINCT (cannot play faction)

This creates **permanent stakes** in campaign mode. Every battle risks the species.

### Emergent Syndicate: Collective Memory
- **Learn from Defeats:** When you lose, gain 1 Evolution Token
- **Evolution Tokens:** Spend to permanently unlock new Metamorph strains
- **Collective Archive:** Track all battles in campaign log
- **Hive Growth:** Winning battles spawns new Hive Nodes (map control)

---

## Thematic Pairings

### Evolution Clash
- Vestige Bloodlines vs Emergent Syndicate (biological evolution vs technological evolution)

### Nature vs Undead
- Vestige Bloodlines (living evolution) vs The Ossuarium (undead corruption)

### Swarm vs Tank
- Emergent Syndicate (many weak) vs Dwarven Forge-Guilds (one strong)
