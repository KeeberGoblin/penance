### Design Philosophy

All new content follows **Kingdom Death: Monster** inspiration:
- **No pure heroes or villains** - every NPC is broken in different ways
- **Bodies tell stories** - physical mutations, scars, and modifications matter
- **Meaningful scarcity** - resources are limited, forcing hard choices
- **Permanent consequences** - Scars, settlements, and deaths have lasting impact
- **Mystery over answers** - Chronicle entries raise questions, not solve them
- **Asymmetric mechanics** - unique abilities that can't be replicated
- **Brutal tone** - suffering, sacrifice, and survival
