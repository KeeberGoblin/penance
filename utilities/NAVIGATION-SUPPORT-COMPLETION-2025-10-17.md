- Sequential navigation (where applicable)
- Rules cross-references

### 2. Support Units Coverage
All 8 factions now have support-units.md files:
- 4 factions: Fully complete (100%)
- 2 factions: Framework complete (85%)
- 2 factions: Template structure (20%)

### 3. Design Frameworks Established
The Vestige and Exchange support units provide comprehensive templates showing:
