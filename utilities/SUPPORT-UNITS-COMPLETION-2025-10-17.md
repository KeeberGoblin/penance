## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CONSISTENCY

Each faction's support units reflect their core identity:

### Vestige Bloodlines (Animal Heritage)
- Units are mutated kin (wolf, bear, raven, chitin, serpent)
- Pack tactics and coordination (tribal structure)
- Savage, primal combat (no technology)
- Underdog spirit (stronger when desperate)

### Soulstone Exchange (Corporate Warfare)
- Units are hired mercenaries (not loyal followers)
- Credit-based hiring (economics over honor)
- Temporary duration (contracts expire)
- Pay-to-win mechanics (money = power)

### Emergent Syndicate (Chosen Evolution)
- Units are bio-engineered organisms (scientific)
- Transformation and adaptation (metamorphosis)
- Hive-mind coordination (collective intelligence)
- Swarm tactics (many weak vs few strong)

### Crucible Packs (Honor Through Fire)
- Units are tribal warriors (Pack-Kin)
- Honor Duel system (sacred combat)
- Forge token economy (volcanic fire worship)
- Ancestral legacy (weapons persist across generations)

## NEXT STEPS (Recommended)

### Priority 1: Playtest Preparation
1. Create quick-start guide for new players
2. Generate printable quick reference sheets
3. Build first playtest scenario with pre-built decks
4. Create pilot tracking sheets

### Priority 2: Behavior Decks Expansion
1. Complete behavior decks for Vestige Bloodlines (18 cards)
2. Complete behavior decks for Exchange (18 cards)
3. Total: 36 additional behavior cards needed

### Priority 3: Visual Assets
1. Create unit stat cards for Tabletop Simulator
2. Generate AI art for support units (using existing art guide)
3. Create hex tokens for units

### Priority 4: Playtesting
1. Test support unit balance (ensure not overpowered vs Caskets)
2. Test behavior deck AI (ensure units make smart decisions)
3. Test faction synergies (multi-faction alliances)
