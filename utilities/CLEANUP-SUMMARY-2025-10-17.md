## üö´ Files Kept (Not Deleted)

The following files were considered but **kept** for valid reasons:

### In `archive/`

| File | Size | Reason to Keep |
|------|------|----------------|
| `SYSTEM-OVERHAUL-SUMMARY.md` | 10KB | Historical record of v2.0 transition |
| `PLAYTEST-READY-v1.md` | 11KB | Historical snapshot of v1.0 playtest state |
| `church-deck-complete-legacy.md` | 16KB | Reference for pre-v2.0 fixed-deck system |
| `dwarves-deck-complete-legacy.md` | 19KB | Reference for pre-v2.0 fixed-deck system |
| `church-sample-sheet.svg` | 15KB | TTS reference sheet (may be used) |
| `dwarven-sample-sheet.svg` | 15KB | TTS reference sheet (may be used) |
| `CONTRADICTION-REPORT.md` | 12KB | Historical lore consistency audit |
| `PILOT-STATE-CORRECTIONS.md` | 12KB | Historical mechanics corrections |

**Reason**: These provide valuable historical context and document design decisions. They're small enough that storage cost is negligible compared to historical value.

### In `utilities/archive/audits/`

| File | Size | Reason to Keep |
|------|------|----------------|
| `AUDIT-2025-10-15.md` | 13KB | Recent audit findings |
| `COMPREHENSIVE-V3-AUDIT-2025-10-14.md` | 14KB | V3 system audit |
| `AUDIT-2025-10-16-github-copilot.md` | 17KB | GitHub Copilot audit (moved here) |

**Reason**: Recent audits provide evolution of repository health over time. Useful for tracking improvements.

## üîÆ Future Cleanup Opportunities

### Low Priority (Consider in Future)

1. **SVG Sample Sheets** (`church-sample-sheet.svg`, `dwarven-sample-sheet.svg`)
   - Size: 30KB combined

   - Recommendation: Keep for now, revisit if TTS system changes

2. **Legacy Deck Documentation** (`*-deck-complete-legacy.md`)
   - Size: 35KB combined
   - Current status: Historical reference for v1.0 system
   - Recommendation: Keep as design history

3. **Archived Effects** (`utilities/archived-effects/`)
   - Status: Not checked in this cleanup
   - Recommendation: Review contents in future cleanup pass
