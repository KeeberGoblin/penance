## TACTICAL GUIDELINES

### Credit Economy
- **Generation**: War Profiteer (3 per death), Hostile Negotiation (1 per hit), Sell Out (2 per card discarded), War Bonds (1 per enemy nearby)
- **Spending**: Mercenaries (5-10 Credits), Premium Ammunition (2 Credits), Economic Leverage (3 Credits), Insurance Policy (4 Credits)
- **Optimal banking**: Keep 5-8 Credits in reserve for emergency Insurance Policy or Hire Mercenary
- **Credit sharing**: Merchant Guilds don't share (unlike Emergent). Every pilot manages their own economy.

### Mercenary Management
- **Hire timing**: Hire Mercenaries when you have 5+ Credits and need action economy (multiple attacks per turn)
- **Buff synergy**: Contract Enforcement makes Mercenaries 10 HP, 4 damage (much stronger)
- **Liquidate wounded**: If Mercenary has 3 HP or less, use Liquidate Assets (destroy for 8 Credits)
- **Elite timing**: Premium Contract at 10 Credits for Elite Mercenary (15 HP, 5 damage) - save for late-game power spike

### Economic Warfare
- **Market Manipulation timing**: Use at start of round for maximum impact (buff allies +2 SP OR debuff enemies -2 SP)
- **Economic Leverage**: Best used on high-threat targets (force them to skip turn OR take 4 damage)
- **Executive Order**: Ultimate control card (spend 10 Credits to skip enemy entire turn)
- **Bribe usage**: Use on enemy attackers to reduce accuracy (-2 to hit) or enemy movers to slow them (-1 movement)

### Risk Management
- **Insurance Policy**: Hold 4 Credits in reserve always (emergency negate lethal damage, once per mission)
- **Golden Parachute**: Hold 5 Credits for escape (teleport 8 hexes when cornered, once per mission)
- **Defense Contract**: Passive income even when hit (reduces 1 damage, gain 1 Credit)
- **Monopoly Control**: At 10+ Credits, gain permanent +1 SP per turn (scales infinitely)

## LORE INTEGRATION

Every card reflects the Merchant Guilds' war profiteering philosophy:

**"Every war has a price"** - War Profiteer, Hostile Takeover, Asset Liquidation (profiting from violence)

**"We sell to all sides"** - Hire Mercenary, Contract Enforcement, Mercenary Volley (disposable contractors)

**"Money talks"** - Economic Leverage, Bribe, Executive Order (buying influence/control)

**"Liquidate losses"** - Sell Out, Liquidate Assets, Hostile Acquisition (cut losses ruthlessly)

**"Insure investments"** - Insurance Policy, Defense Contract, Golden Parachute (risk management)

**"Market manipulation"** - Market Manipulation, Insider Trading, Monopoly Control (economic warfare)

**Notable Cultural Details**:
- **No Faction Loyalty**: Merchant Guilds sell to Church, Dwarves, Elves, Blighted - whoever pays
- **Contracts Over Honor**: Mercenaries fulfill contracts, then leave (no emotional bonds)
- **War Profiteering**: The longer wars last, the more money Guilds make (vested interest in perpetual conflict)
- **Executive Pilots**: Merchant pilots are CEOs in Caskets, not warriors. They manage portfolios of violence.
- **Death Benefits**: When Mercenaries die, Guilds profit from insurance payouts (incentivized to hire and sacrifice)
- **Economic Sanctions**: Guilds can financially ruin settlements by cutting supply lines (blockades = market crashes)

---

## DESIGN NOTES

### Balance Considerations
- **Credit Economy**: Snowballs if unchecked (needs early pressure to deny Credit generation)
- **Mercenary Action Economy**: Multiple units = multiple attacks per turn (strong but expensive)
- **Control Cards**: Economic Leverage + Executive Order can lock enemies out (feels bad, but thematic)
- **Scaling**: Monopoly Control creates infinite SP scaling (balanced by 10+ Credit requirement)

### Unique Mechanics
- **Credit Tokens**: Separate resource from SP, generated through profiteering
- **Mercenary Summons**: Only faction with temporary summonable units
- **Economic Control**: Bribe, freeze assets, skip turns (unprecedented control)
- **Profit From All Deaths**: War Profiteer triggers on ANY death (enemies, allies, neutral)
- **Equipment Theft**: Hostile Takeover loots enemy equipment (only faction with this)

### Counterplay
- **Against Merchants**: Deny Credit generation (don't die near them), kill Mercenaries immediately, pressure early (before economy scales)
- **Merchant Counters**: Blighted (swarm overwhelms Mercenaries), Nomads (mobility avoids economic control), Emergent (hive-mind outlasts economic pressure)

### Faction Identity vs Other Factions
- **vs Church**: Church self-harms for power; Merchants hire others to fight for them
- **vs Dwarves**: Dwarves build lasting fortifications; Merchants buy disposable forces
- **vs Ossuarium**: Ossuarium resurrect their own; Merchants hire replacements
- **vs Elves**: Elves fight for nature; Merchants fight for profit
- **vs Blighted**: Blighted are desperate outcasts; Merchants are wealthy opportunists
- **vs Nomads**: Nomads survive through adaptation; Merchants thrive through exploitation
- **vs Emergent**: Emergent share resources collectively; Merchants hoard wealth individually
- **vs Fae**: Fae bargain for stories/concepts; Merchants bargain for tangible wealth
