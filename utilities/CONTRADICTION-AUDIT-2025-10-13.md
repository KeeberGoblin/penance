# Contradiction Audit Report
**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Auditor**: Claude (AI Assistant)
**Scope**: Repository-wide consistency check

---

## Executive Summary

Conducted comprehensive audit of the Penance repository to identify and fix contradictions in naming conventions, terminology, and system descriptions. **All critical contradictions have been resolved.**

### Issues Found and Fixed
1. **"Resonance Engine" naming inconsistency** (FIXED)
2. **Faction naming** (NO ISSUES FOUND)
3. **Equipment system** (NO ISSUES FOUND)

---

## 1. Engine Naming Convention (FIXED)

### Issue
According to [resonance-engine-names.md](/workspaces/penance/docs/lore/resonance-engine-names.md), the naming convention should be:
- **Player-facing/Gameplay**: "The Engine" (universal, simple)
- **Historical term**: "The Resonance Engine" (pre-Sundering scientific jargon only)
- **Full technical name**: "The Theslar Engine" (T.E.)

However, many files were using "Resonance Engine" in current-day gameplay contexts where they should use "The Engine".

### Changes Made

**Pattern Applied**:
```
OLD: "When Theslar activated the Resonance Engine..."
NEW: "When Theslar activated The Engine (then called the 'Resonance Engine' by scientists)..."

OLD: "The Resonance Engine still pulses..."
NEW: "The Engine still pulses..."

OLD: "Destroy the Resonance Engine"
NEW: "Destroy The Engine"
```

**Exceptions** (Kept as "Resonance Engine"):
- Historical timeline entries (Year 0 references)
- Pre-Sundering scientific terminology
- File titles for historical documentation (e.g., `resonance-engine.md`)
- Faction-specific names remain per [resonance-engine-names.md](/workspaces/penance/docs/lore/resonance-engine-names.md):
  - Church: "The Theslar Sin"
  - Dwarves: "Theslar's Folly"
  - Ossuarium: "The Ledger's Opening"
  - Elves: "The Withering"
  - Wyrd Conclave: "The Unmaking"
  - Nomads: "The Break" / "Old Nik's Bomb"
  - Merchants: "The Theslar Recession"
  - Blighted: "The Mutation Dawn"
  - Chitinous: "The Emergence"

## 2. Faction Naming (NO ISSUES FOUND)

### Verified Correct Names
Searched repository for deprecated faction names. **Zero instances found in active docs folder.**

**Correct Names** (per [CLAUDE.md](utilities/CLAUDE.md)):
- ✅ **The Ossuarium** (NOT "Undead Court" or "Bone-Courts")
- ✅ **The Wyrd Conclave** (NOT "Twilight Courts" or "Fae Courts")
- ✅ **Elven Verdant Covenant** (NOT "Elven Remnants")

**Archive Folder**: Old names exist in `/archive/` directory (legacy files, not active documentation).

### Verification
```bash
grep -r "Undead Court\|Bone-Court\|Twilight Court\|Fae Court\|Elven Remnants" docs/
# Result: 0 matches
```

---

## 3. Equipment System (NO ISSUES FOUND)

### Verified Current System
Searched for references to deprecated fixed-deck system. **Zero instances found in active docs.**

**Current System** (per [SYSTEM-OVERHAUL-SUMMARY.md](/workspaces/penance/archive/SYSTEM-OVERHAUL-SUMMARY.md)):
- Variable deck size (26-50 cards)
- Modular equipment: Weapon + Shield/Offhand + Accessories
- 60+ craftable/lootable equipment items
- Deck composition: 10 Universal + 6 Faction Core + X Equipment + 2 Tactics

**Deprecated System** (no longer referenced):
- Fixed 30-card decks
- 12 Primary Weapon cards (locked to Casket)
- 6 Secondary Equipment (choose 1 of 4)

### Verification
```bash
grep -r "12 Primary Weapon cards\|fixed 30-card deck\|Secondary Equipment (choose 1 of 4)" docs/
# Result: 0 matches
```

**Note**: References to "30-card deck" in [README.md](/workspaces/penance/README.md) are correct - 30 cards is the standard/default size, but system allows 26-50 card variation.

---

## 4. Additional Findings

### Minor Consistency Notes

#### Deck Size References
- [README.md](/workspaces/penance/README.md) line 38: "Your 30-card deck IS your HP"
  - **Status**: CORRECT - 30 is the standard/baseline deck size
  - **Context**: System allows 26-50 cards, but 30 is the default for balance

#### Historical Documentation
- Files in `/archive/` contain deprecated terminology
  - **Status**: ACCEPTABLE - archive folder is intentionally historical
  - **Recommendation**: Keep archive as-is for version history

#### Event Tables
- [event-tables-kdm-style.md](/workspaces/penance/docs/campaigns/event-tables-kdm-style.md) uses "Resonance Engine" in some flavor text
  - **Status**: ACCEPTABLE - refers to historical events (Year 0 context)
  - **Action Taken**: No changes needed

---

## 5. Files Not Requiring Changes

### Documentation That Remains Correct
- [CLAUDE.md](utilities/CLAUDE.md) - Master context document (already correct)
- [README.md](/workspaces/penance/README.md) - Project overview (correct terminology)
- All faction deck files in `docs/factions/*/deck-equipment-system.md` - Equipment v2.0 (already correct)
- [quick-reference.md](/workspaces/penance/docs/rules/quick-reference.md) - Uses "The Engine" correctly
- [turn-structure.md](/workspaces/penance/docs/rules/turn-structure.md) - No Engine references (gameplay-focused)
- [combat-system.md](/workspaces/penance/docs/rules/combat-system.md) - Uses correct deck terminology

---

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
- [x] Replace "Resonance Engine" with "The Engine" in gameplay contexts
- [x] Add historical context notes where appropriate
- [x] Update wiki navigation links

### Future Maintenance
1. **Add linting rule** to CI/CD to catch "Resonance Engine" in new docs (except historical contexts)
2. **Update contribution guidelines** to specify naming conventions:
   - Use "The Engine" for current-day references
   - Use "Resonance Engine" only for pre-Sundering historical context
3. **Create glossary page** in wiki to document naming conventions

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Playtest with updated terminology (ensure clarity)
- [ ] Check wiki navigation (all links work correctly)
- [ ] Verify search functionality finds "The Engine" results
