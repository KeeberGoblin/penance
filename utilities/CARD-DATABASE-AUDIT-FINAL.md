## SECTION 2: FACTION COMPLETENESS TABLE

### Expected vs Actual Card Counts

**Expected Deck Composition**: 10 faction core + 6 primary equipment + 5 secondary equipment = **21 cards**

| Faction | JSON Cards | Markdown Cards | Missing from JSON | Status | Priority |
|---------|-----------|---------------|------------------|--------|----------|
| **Wyrd Conclave** | 21 | 6 | 6 cards | ✓ COMPLETE (21/21) | Low |
| **Church** | 10 | 13 | 5 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (10/21) | HIGH |
| **Dwarves** | 10 | 6 | 0 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (10/21) | High |
| **Elves** | 10 | 6 | 0 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (10/21) | High |
| **Ossuarium** | 6 | 6 | 0 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (6/21) | CRITICAL |
| **Emergent** | 10 | 0 | 0 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (10/21) | High |
| **Nomads** | 10 | 0 | 0 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (10/21) | High |
| **Exchange** | 10 | 0 | 0 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (10/21) | High |
| **Crucible** | 10 | 0 | 0 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (10/21) | High |
| **Vestige-Bloodlines** | 10 | 0 | 0 cards | ✗ INCOMPLETE (10/21) | High |

**Analysis**:
- **Markdown files show fewer cards** because many factions haven't documented their primary/secondary equipment sections yet
- The **JSON appears more complete** - it contains 10 faction core cards for most factions
- **Wyrd Conclave is the only complete faction** with all three card types (faction + primary + secondary)

---

## SECTION 3: MISSING CARDS (In Markdown but NOT in JSON)

### Total: 11 Cards Missing from JSON

These cards are documented in faction markdown files but do NOT appear in the JSON database:

#### CHURCH (5 missing cards)
1. **Divine Guidance** - Accuracy Buff sigil
2. **Martyrdom's Certainty** - Sigil
3. **Zealot's Focus** - Sigil
4. **Point-Blank Execution** - Weapon Attack
5. **Confession Under Duress** - Utility

**Note**: The Church markdown file documents 13 cards total (6 mandatory core + 7 optional sigils/weapons), but JSON only contains 10.

#### WYRD CONCLAVE (6 missing cards)
1. **Fairy Dust**
2. **Mirror Step**
3. **Oath-Binding Contract**
4. **Reality Bargain**
5. **Stolen Reflection**
6. **What-If Paradox**

**Note**: These may be older card names that were renamed in JSON. Cross-reference required.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Add these 11 cards to JSON database OR update markdown to reflect actual card names.

---

## SECTION 4: EXTRA CARDS (In JSON but NOT in Markdown)

### Total: 82 Cards in JSON Not Documented in Markdown

This is the **MAJOR FINDING** - the JSON database contains many more cards than the markdown files document. This suggests:
1. Markdown files are outdated/incomplete
2. JSON was bulk-populated without updating documentation
3. Card names may have been changed

---

## SECTION 5: DATA QUALITY CHECKS

### Required Fields Validation

✓ **PASSED** - All cards have required fields:
- `id` - Unique identifier (kebab-case)
- `name` - Display name
- `type` - Card type (attack, defense, utility, etc.)
- `cost` - SP cost (0-5)
- `effect` - Description of what the card does

### Duplicate ID Check

✓ **PASSED** - No duplicate card IDs found across all 170 cards

### Field Consistency

**Keywords**: All cards have appropriate keywords array
- Examples: `["universal", "movement"]`, `["faction", "church"]`, `["equipment", "weapon"]`

**Card Count Field**: Most cards have `cardCount` field indicating deck quantity
- Universal cards: 1-3 copies each
- Faction cards: 1 copy each
- Equipment: Variable (weapon-dependent)

**Missing Fields** (Non-Critical):
- Some cards lack `range` field (acceptable for passive/reactive cards)
- Some cards lack `heat` field (acceptable for cards that don't generate heat)
- Some cards lack `keywords` array (should be added for consistency)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Add `keywords` array to all cards for better searchability and filtering.

---

## SECTION 6: EQUIPMENT POOL CROSS-REFERENCE

### Equipment Pool Complete (equipment-pool-complete.md)

The reference document lists **60+ equipment items** across categories:

#### CATEGORY 1: WEAPONS (12 weapon types)

- Salvage Sigil - Nomads (2 cards)
- Contract Sigil - Exchange (3 cards)

**Total Sigil Cards**: 31 cards

### Equipment in JSON Database

**JSON Section**: `"equipment": []` - **46 cards total**

**Gap Analysis**:
- **Documented in markdown**: 121 equipment cards (68 weapons + 11 shields + 11 plating + 31 sigils)
- **In JSON**: 46 equipment cards
- **Missing**: 75 equipment cards (62% of equipment pool)

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The equipment pool is severely incomplete in the JSON database.

**RECOMMENDATION**:
1. Add all 121 equipment cards from `equipment-pool-complete.md` to JSON
2. Verify card stats (cost, range, damage) match between markdown and JSON
3. Cross-reference equipment restrictions (faction-specific vs universal)

---

## SECTION 7: CARD NAMING CONVENTIONS

### Observed Patterns in JSON

**Naming Style**: Title Case with hyphens in IDs
- ID: `"desperate-lunge"` (kebab-case)
- Name: `"Desperate Lunge"` (Title Case)

**Apostrophe Handling**:
- JSON uses smart quotes: `"Martyr's Brand"`, `"Zealot's Focus"`
- Consistent across all cards

**Multi-Word Cards**:
- Properly capitalized: `"Hive-Mind Link"`, `"Blood Offering"`
- No ALL CAPS in JSON (unlike markdown headers)

### Potential Naming Mismatches

The audit found cards in JSON that may be renamed versions of markdown cards:

**Example**: Church faction
- Markdown: "DIVINE GUIDANCE (Sigil)"
- JSON: Might be named "Divine Guidance" or renamed to something else

**RECOMMENDATION**: Create a card name mapping table to resolve markdown↔JSON discrepancies.

---

## SECTION 8: RECOMMENDATIONS (Priority Order)

### CRITICAL PRIORITY (Do First)

1. **Complete Ossuarium Faction** (6/21 cards)
   - Add 15 missing cards: 6 primary equipment + 5 secondary equipment + 4 additional faction core
   - Current state: Only has 6 faction core cards

2. **Add Missing Equipment Pool to JSON** (75 cards missing)
   - Migrate all 121 equipment cards from `equipment-pool-complete.md` to JSON
   - Ensure card stats (cost, damage, range, heat) match exactly
   - Verify faction restrictions are correctly tagged

3. **Reconcile Church Faction Discrepancy** (5 cards missing)
   - Add the 5 documented sigils/weapons from markdown to JSON:
     - Divine Guidance, Martyrdom's Certainty, Zealot's Focus
     - Point-Blank Execution, Confession Under Duress

### HIGH PRIORITY

4. **Complete All Faction Decks** (9 factions need +11 cards each)
   - Each faction needs: 6 primary equipment + 5 secondary equipment
   - Total: 99 cards to add (9 factions × 11 cards)
   - Reference Wyrd Conclave as template (only complete faction)

5. **Document the 82 Extra Cards in JSON**
   - Create markdown documentation for cards that exist in JSON but not in markdown
   - OR verify these cards exist in other documentation files
   - Possible these are newer cards added to JSON without updating markdown

6. **Resolve Wyrd Conclave Naming Discrepancy** (6 cards)
   - Markdown lists: Fairy Dust, Mirror Step, Oath-Binding Contract, etc.
   - JSON lists: Bargain Struck, Fae Mirror, Shimmer Step, etc.
   - Determine if these are renames OR different cards entirely

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

7. **Add Card Keywords to All Entries**
   - Some cards lack `keywords` array
   - Keywords improve searchability and filtering
   - Standard tags: faction name, card type, mechanic type

8. **Standardize Equipment Card Format**
   - Ensure all equipment cards have:
     - `cardType: "equipment"`
     - `equipmentSlot`: "weapon" | "shield" | "accessory"
     - `craftingCost`: Scrap cost
     - `weight`: "light" | "medium" | "heavy"

9. **Create Equipment Cross-Reference Tool**
   - Build interactive tool to compare JSON ↔ markdown
   - Highlight discrepancies in stats (cost, damage, range)
   - Flag missing equipment items

### LOW PRIORITY

10. **Add Tactics Cards** (2 per faction expected)
    - Each faction deck includes "2 Tactics" cards
    - These are not currently in the JSON database
    - May be player-selected from a universal pool

11. **Verify Support Unit Cards** (7 cards in JSON)
    - Cross-reference with campaign support unit documentation
    - Ensure stats match across all sources

12. **Create Card Database Validation Script**
    - Automated JSON schema validation
    - Check for required fields, valid ranges, consistent formatting
    - Flag duplicate IDs, missing keywords, invalid costs

---

## SECTION 9: SUGGESTED WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Equipment Pool Migration (Highest Impact)

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

1. Create JSON structure for all 121 equipment cards
2. Copy stats from `equipment-pool-complete.md`:
   - Card names, SP costs, ranges, damage values
   - Heat generation, keywords, effects
   - Crafting costs, weight class, faction restrictions
3. Validate against markdown documentation
4. Test with deck builder tool (if exists)

### Phase 2: Complete Ossuarium (Most Incomplete Faction)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

1. Add 15 missing cards to bring to 21 total
2. Reference Church/Dwarves/Elves for primary/secondary structure
3. Ensure Death Mark sigil is included (faction-exclusive)
4. Verify Decay card mechanic is properly documented

### Phase 3: Complete Remaining 8 Factions

**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours (1-1.5 hours per faction)

1. Add 11 cards to each faction (6 primary + 5 secondary)
2. Use Wyrd Conclave as template
3. Assign faction-appropriate equipment from universal pool
4. Add faction-exclusive sigils where applicable

### Phase 4: Reconcile Markdown Documentation

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

1. Update all faction markdown files with complete card lists
2. Add the 82 "extra" cards from JSON to markdown
3. Resolve naming discrepancies (especially Wyrd Conclave)
4. Standardize formatting across all markdown files

### Phase 5: Validation & Testing

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

1. Run automated validation script on JSON
2. Cross-reference all equipment stats between JSON and markdown
3. Build sample decks for each faction to verify completeness
4. Create change log documenting all additions/changes

---

## SECTION 10: TECHNICAL NOTES

### JSON Structure Analysis

**Well-Formatted Sections**:
- Consistent `_meta` header with version and lastUpdated
- All cards use consistent field names
- Proper JSON syntax (no trailing commas, valid escaping)

**Card Object Schema** (observed):
```json
{
  "id": "string (kebab-case)",
  "name": "string (Title Case)",
  "type": "string (attack|defense|utility|movement|passive|reactive)",
  "cost": number (0-5),
  "range": "string (Melee|Ranged X-Y|Self|Area)",
  "effect": "string (description)",
  "heat": "string (+X|-X|0)",
  "keywords": ["array", "of", "strings"],
  "cardCount": number (1-3),
  "cardType": "string (core|faction|primary|secondary|equipment)"
}
```

**Optional Fields**:
- `damage`: number (for attack cards)
- `healing`: number (for utility cards)
- `equipmentSlot`: string (for equipment cards)
- `craftingCost`: number (for equipment cards)
- `weight`: string (for equipment cards)
- `factionRestrictions`: array (for faction-specific equipment)

### Markdown Parsing Challenges

**Header Variations Found**:
- `### 1. CARD NAME (Type)` - Numbered with type
- `### CARD NAME` - Unnumbered
- `#### EQUIPMENT NAME` - Equipment cards (4 hashes)

**Inconsistent Card Counts**:
- Some markdown files list 6 faction core cards (minimum mandatory)
- Others list 10+ cards (including optional additions)
- Wyrd Conclave markdown shows only 6 but JSON has 21

**RECOMMENDATION**: Standardize markdown format:
- Use `### N. CARD NAME` for all faction core cards
- Use `#### EQUIPMENT NAME (X cards)` for all equipment
- Clearly mark optional vs mandatory cards

## CONCLUSION

The card database is **functional but incomplete**. The JSON contains 170 cards with good data quality (no missing fields, no duplicate IDs), but:

1. **Equipment pool is 62% incomplete** (46/121 cards)
2. **9 of 10 factions** lack their primary/secondary equipment cards
3. **Ossuarium is critically incomplete** (6/21 cards - only has faction core)
4. **Documentation mismatch**: 82 cards in JSON lack markdown documentation

**Next Steps**:
1. Add 75 missing equipment cards from markdown to JSON
2. Complete Ossuarium faction (add 15 cards)
3. Add primary/secondary equipment to 8 incomplete factions (88 cards)
4. Reconcile the 82 undocumented JSON cards

**Estimated Total Work**: 178+ cards to add/document
