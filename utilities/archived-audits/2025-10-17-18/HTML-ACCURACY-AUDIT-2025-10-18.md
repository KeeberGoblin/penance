# HTML Pages Accuracy and Outdated Information Audit
**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Scope**: All HTML files in `/workspaces/penance/docs/codex/` directory
**Auditor**: Claude Code

---

## Executive Summary

This audit examined all 64 HTML files in the `docs/codex/` directory for outdated information, inconsistencies with markdown sources, broken links, and version mismatches. **Critical issues found**: 2 faction HTML pages link to deleted markdown files, combat system HTML is outdated (v1.0 example vs v2.0 modular system), deck size inconsistencies across pages, and several navigation issues.

**Priority**: High. The codex is the primary reference for playtesters, and inconsistencies could cause confusion about current game state.

## Section 1: OUTDATED HTML PAGES

### 1.1 CRITICAL: Broken Faction Deck Links (2 Files)

**Files**:
- `/workspaces/penance/docs/codex/faction-nomads.html` (line 62)
- `/workspaces/penance/docs/codex/faction-emergent.html` (line 58)

**Issue**: Both HTML pages link to **deleted markdown files**:
- Nomads HTML links to: `docs/factions/nomads/deck-complete-design.md` (DELETED)
- Emergent HTML links to: `docs/factions/emergent/deck-complete-design.md` (DELETED)

**Current State**:
- Actual files are: `deck-equipment-system.md` (same naming convention as Church/Dwarves/Elves/Ossuarium)
- Git status shows these as **untracked new files**, meaning the rename happened but HTML wasn't updated

**Fix Required**:
```html
<!-- NOMADS - CHANGE LINE 62 FROM: -->
<td><a href="https://github.com/KeeberGoblin/penance/blob/main/docs/factions/nomads/deck-complete-design.md" target="_blank">View Full Nomad Deck</a></td>

<!-- TO: -->
<td><a href="https://github.com/KeeberGoblin/penance/blob/main/docs/factions/nomads/deck-equipment-system.md" target="_blank">View Full Nomad Deck (v2.0 Equipment System)</a></td>

<!-- EMERGENT - CHANGE LINE 58 FROM: -->
<td><a href="https://github.com/KeeberGoblin/penance/blob/main/docs/factions/emergent/deck-complete-design.md" target="_blank">View Full Emergent Deck (v2.0 Equipment System)</a></td>

<!-- TO: -->
<td><a href="https://github.com/KeeberGoblin/penance/blob/main/docs/factions/emergent/deck-equipment-system.md" target="_blank">View Full Emergent Deck (v2.0 Equipment System)</a></td>
```

---

### 1.2 Combat System Page - Outdated v1.0 Example

**File**: `/workspaces/penance/docs/codex/rules-combat.html`

**Issue**: The HTML page describes a **simplified v1.0 deck structure** (30 fixed cards):
- 10 Universal Cards (mandatory)
- 12 Primary Weapon Cards
- 6 Secondary Weapon/Equipment Cards
- 2 Faction Tactic Cards
- **Total: 30 cards fixed**

**Actual v2.0 System** (per `docs/rules/combat-system.md` line 24-34):
- 10 Universal Cards (mandatory)
- 6 Faction Core Cards
- **Variable Equipment Cards (3-30 cards)**: Weapon + Shield/Offhand + Accessories
- 2 Faction Tactic Cards
- **Total: 26-50 cards (variable based on equipment)**

**Impact**: Players reading the HTML codex will think decks are always 30 cards, when they actually range from 26-50 cards based on equipment choices.

**Fix Required**:
- Update `rules-combat.html` lines 24-58 to match the v2.0 variable deck system
- Add note: "This section shows **simplified v1.0 example** for teaching. See faction deck pages for full v2.0 modular equipment."

---

### 1.3 Deck Size Inconsistencies Across Faction Pages

**Issue**: Different pages cite different "standard" deck sizes:

| Page | Deck Size Mentioned | Actual v2.0 Range |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| `rules-combat.html` | 30 cards (fixed) | **26-50 cards** |
| `scenarios.html` line 130 | Church: 29 cards | **26-50 cards** |
| `scenarios.html` line 145 | Dwarves: 33 cards | **26-50 cards** |
| `content-home.html` line 28 | "Variable Deck Sizes (26-50 cards)" | ✅ CORRECT |

**Root Cause**: Scenarios page uses pre-built example decks from v1.0 for teaching, but doesn't clarify these are **simplified starter decks**, not the only valid configurations.

**Fix Required**: Add clarifying text to `scenarios.html` after each pre-built deck:
```html
<p style="font-style: italic; opacity: 0.8;">
    NOTE: This is a simplified starter deck for teaching. In v2.0, players can build decks ranging from 26-50 cards using the modular equipment system. See faction deck pages for full options.
</p>
```

---

### 1.4 Version Label Inconsistencies

**Files with v2.0/v3.0 references**: 22 files found (via grep)

**Inconsistency Pattern**:
- Most rules pages correctly cite "v2.0 Base Rules" or "v3.0 Optional Rules"
- Faction pages inconsistently label equipment system:
  - Church, Dwarves, Elves, Ossuarium: ✅ "View Full [Faction] Deck **(v2.0 Equipment System)**"
  - Nomads, Emergent, Vestige, Exchange, Crucible, Wyrd: ❌ No version label (or broken link to old files)

**Fix Required**: Standardize all faction deck links to include "(v2.0 Equipment System)" suffix

---

## Section 2: PLACEHOLDER CONTENT

### 2.1 Design-Only Factions (Status Unclear)

**Issue**: Several faction HTML pages exist but lack clear **"Design-Only"** vs **"Playable"** status banners.

**Analysis**:
- `content-home.html` line 94-96 lists 7 factions as **"Design Only"** with ⏳ Future Works
- But individual faction HTML pages don't have visible status banners
- Main site `index.html` (line 1190-1203) has clear banner: **"READY FOR PLAYTEST (6 FACTIONS)"** with list

**Current Design-Only Factions** (per content-home.html):
1. Wyrd Conclave (The Fae) - HTML exists, no status banner
2. Nomad Collective - HTML exists, broken link, no status banner
3. The Exchange - HTML exists, no status banner
4. Vestige Bloodlines - HTML exists, no status banner
5. Emergent Syndicate - HTML exists, broken link, no status banner
6. Crucible Packs - HTML exists, no status banner
7. Draconid Remembrance - Listed as "NPC-Only Faction" in codex index

**Recommendation**: Add status banners to all design-only faction HTML pages:
```html
<div style="background: var(--aged-gold); border: 3px solid var(--dark-red); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
    <p style="color: var(--ink-brown); font-weight: 700; margin: 0;">
        ⚠️ DESIGN-ONLY FACTION - Complete deck system (21 cards), support units (6), and mechanics. Ready for alpha playtesting. Not included in official v2.0 playtest package.
    </p>
</div>
```

---

### 2.2 Missing Scenario HTML Files

**Issue**: `docs/codex/scenarios.html` references scenarios but doesn't link to individual scenario detail pages.

**Current State**:
- `docs/codex/scenarios.html` exists with overview (checked ✅)
- Individual scenario pages exist in codex:
  - `scenario-proving-grounds.html` ✅
  - `scenario-reliquary-ruins.html` ✅
  - `scenario-escort-duty.html` ✅
  - `scenario-king-of-the-hill.html` ✅
  - `scenario-sabotage-mission.html` ✅
  - `scenario-example-of-play.html` ✅
  - `scenario-boss-iron-saint.html` ✅
- **NEW FILE FOUND**: `docs/scenarios/boss-dr-theslar.html` ✅
  - This is **outside** the codex directory
  - Referenced in `scenarios.html` line 17 with hidden link: `<a href="../scenarios/boss-dr-theslar.html">???</a>`

**No Issues Found** - All scenario pages exist and are accessible via navigation.

---

## Section 3: BROKEN LINKS

### 3.1 CRITICAL: Faction Deck Links (Already Covered in Section 1.1)

**Broken Links**: 2 faction pages link to deleted markdown files (Nomads, Emergent)

---

### 3.2 Internal Navigation Links (Status: ✅ WORKING)

**Tested**:
- Codex index sidebar navigation (✅ all links use `onclick="loadContent()"`)
- Faction pages breadcrumb navigation (✅ working)
- Cross-references between lore pages (✅ working)
- Scenario cross-links (✅ working)

**No broken internal navigation found.**

---

### 3.3 External GitHub Links (Status: ⚠️ NOT VERIFIED)

**Note**: This audit did NOT verify external GitHub repository links. If the repository structure has changed (folder renames, file moves), external links may break.

**Recommendation**: Run separate check for GitHub links:
```bash
grep -r "github.com/KeeberGoblin/penance" docs/codex/*.html | grep -o "blob/main/[^\"]*" | sort -u
```
Then verify each path exists in current repo structure.

---

## Section 4: VERSION INCONSISTENCIES

### 4.1 Deck Size Standards

**Inconsistency**:
- Main site (`index.html` line 1115): "Ten factions war..." (10 total factions ✅)
- Codex index sidebar lists exactly **10 factions** in "Playable Factions" section ✅
- Content-home lists **4 playable + 6 design-only + 1 NPC-only = 11 total** ❌

**Faction Count Analysis**:

**Playable (4)**:
1. Church of Absolution ✅
2. Dwarven Forge-Guilds ✅
3. The Ossuarium ✅
4. Elven Verdant Covenant ✅

**Design-Only / Playtest-Ready (6)**:
5. Nomad Collective ✅
6. The Exchange ✅
7. Vestige Bloodlines ✅
8. Emergent Syndicate ✅
9. Crucible Packs ✅
10. The Wyrd Conclave (Fae) ✅

**NPC-Only (1)**:
11. The Draconid Remembrance ⚠️ (listed separately in codex navigation)

**Issue**: Main site says "ten factions war" but codex navigation lists 11 total factions (10 playable/design + 1 NPC-only).

**Resolution**: Either:
- **Option A**: Main site should say "Eleven factions exist (ten playable + one NPC-only)"
- **Option B**: Draconid Remembrance is an NPC-only faction and shouldn't count toward "factions war" (since they're extinct/petrified)
- **Recommendation**: Use Option B - keep "ten factions" narrative, clarify Draconid as "ancient witnesses" not active combatants

---

### 4.2 v2.0 vs v3.0 Optional Rules Clarity

**Issue**: Some pages reference v3.0 optional mechanics without clear "OPTIONAL" labeling.

**Good Example** (`rules-v3-optional.html`): ✅
- Clear title: "v3.0 Optional Rules"
- Explicit statement: "All optional enhancements to v2.0 base rules"

**Potential Confusion** (`content-home.html` line 19-34):
- Lists both v2.0 and campaign systems
- Doesn't clearly separate "v2.0 base" from "v3.0 optional"
- Could imply v3.0 is required for campaign

**Fix Required**: Add clarifying section to `content-home.html`:
```html
<h3>Version Guide</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>v2.0 Base Rules</strong> - Complete playable game (turn structure, combat, equipment, 4 factions)</li>
    <li><strong>v3.0 Optional Rules</strong> - Advanced mechanics (Dice Pool Advantage, Taint Exploitation, Pilot Grit) - use if desired</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign System</strong> - Long-term play (works with v2.0 or v3.0)</li>
</ul>
```

---

### 4.3 Equipment System References

**Issue**: Older HTML pages may reference "v1.0 fixed decks" vs "v2.0 modular equipment"

**Files checked**:
- `rules-combat.html` - Uses v1.0 example (needs update) ❌
- `scenarios.html` - Uses v1.0 pre-built decks for teaching (add disclaimer) ⚠️
- All faction pages - Reference v2.0 equipment system ✅

**No other v1.0 references found.**

---

## Section 5: RECOMMENDATIONS (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: CRITICAL - Fix Broken Links (Immediate)

**Time Estimate**: 5 minutes

1. **Fix Nomads faction deck link** (`faction-nomads.html` line 62)
   - Change: `deck-complete-design.md` → `deck-equipment-system.md`

2. **Fix Emergent faction deck link** (`faction-emergent.html` line 58)
   - Change: `deck-complete-design.md` → `deck-equipment-system.md`

**Impact**: Players clicking these links get 404 errors. Blocks access to deck information.

---

### Priority 2: HIGH - Update Combat System Page (1-2 hours)

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours

3. **Update `rules-combat.html`** to reflect v2.0 variable deck system
   - Replace v1.0 fixed 30-card example with v2.0 modular 26-50 card system
   - Add note: "This section shows simplified teaching example. See faction decks for full equipment options."
   - Link to equipment system documentation

**Impact**: Core rules page is outdated. Players learning combat system get wrong deck construction info.

---

### Priority 3: MEDIUM - Clarify Version Standards (30 minutes)

**Time Estimate**: 30 minutes

4. **Add version guide to `content-home.html`**
   - Clarify v2.0 base vs v3.0 optional vs campaign systems
   - Prevent confusion about what's required vs optional

5. **Add disclaimers to `scenarios.html` pre-built decks**
   - Note that 29-card and 33-card examples are simplified starter decks
   - Reference full v2.0 deck range (26-50 cards)

**Impact**: Prevents confusion about version requirements and deck construction flexibility.

---

### Priority 4: LOW - Add Status Banners to Design-Only Factions (15 minutes)

**Time Estimate**: 15 minutes (3 min per page × 6 factions, already have template)

6. **Add "DESIGN-ONLY" banners to 6 faction pages**:
   - Nomad Collective
   - The Exchange
   - Vestige Bloodlines
   - Emergent Syndicate
   - Crucible Packs
   - The Wyrd Conclave

**Impact**: Clarifies which factions are playtest-ready vs included in official v2.0 package.

---

### Priority 5: LOW - Standardize Faction Deck Link Labels (10 minutes)

**Time Estimate**: 10 minutes

7. **Add "(v2.0 Equipment System)" suffix to all faction deck links**
   - Currently only 4 factions have this label
   - Should be consistent across all 10 factions

**Impact**: Minor consistency issue. Helps players understand all factions use same system.

---

### Priority 6: OPTIONAL - Verify External GitHub Links (30 minutes)

**Time Estimate**: 30 minutes (automated check + manual verification)

8. **Run automated link checker for GitHub repository links**
   - Extract all `github.com/KeeberGoblin/penance/blob/main/*` URLs
   - Verify each file path exists in current repository structure
   - Update any paths broken by folder renames/moves

**Impact**: Prevents future 404s if repository structure changes.
