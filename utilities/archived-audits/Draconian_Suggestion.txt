## üêâ DRACONID REMEMBRANCE - NPC Support Units

**Concept**: Ancient, crystallizing giants who appear rarely as **neutral arbiters, quest-givers, or emergency support**. Not playable, but players can earn their assistance.

**Size**: **20-25 feet tall** (larger than standard Caskets). They don't pilot machines - **they ARE the machines** (their bodies are so calcified they function like living Caskets)

## THE THREE ICONIC DRACONIDS

### 1. **Skykeeper Vyrnathrax** - The Chronicler
**Title**: "The Last Archive"  
**Age**: 612 years old (awake for 180 years total)  
**Role**: Quest-giver, historian, neutral arbiter

#### Physical Description
- **Height**: 24 feet, gaunt and skeletal
- **Appearance**: Mostly **petrified** - his body is 70% crystallized stone. He can barely move anymore. Sits in a throne carved from a dragon skull in the Skyhold Archives
- **Horns**: Massive spiraling horns with **visible memory crystal layers** (like tree rings). Each layer glows faintly when he accesses those memories
- **Eyes**: Empty sockets with **floating sapphire gemstones** that hover where his eyes should be
- **Voice**: Deep, echoing, sounds like speaking from inside a cave
- **Skin**: Cracked marble texture, glowing cyan veins of liquid crystal visible underneath

#### Unique Traits
- **Living Library**: Vyrnathrax has witnessed **all three previous Cataclysms**. He remembers Year -50,000 (the Flood), Year -10,000 (the Fire), and Year 0 (the Void)
- **Memory Crystal Access**: Players can touch his horns to experience **visions of past cycles** (cutscenes showing previous apocalypses)
- **Prophetic Dreams**: He dreams of the **Fourth Ending** (20,000 years in the future). He can tell players what happens if they fail
- **Immobile**: Vyrnathrax cannot leave his throne. His legs are fully calcified into the stone floor. He is part of the Archives now

#### Story Hooks
- **Quest**: "Bring me artifacts from the Old World. I must record them before the cycle ends."
- **Information Broker**: Vyrnathrax knows **everything** - enemy weaknesses, Soulstone locations, Engine blueprints. But he won't give information for free. Players must trade **knowledge** (lore discoveries, completed mission reports)
- **Neutral Ground**: Skyhold Archives is **sacred neutral territory**. All factions respect it. Players can negotiate truces here
- **The Final Record**: If players discover Vyrnathrax is the **only Draconid still conscious** (the other two have entered hibernation), he'll give them his memory crystal and ask them to place it in the Archive when he finally petrifies

### 2. **Emberscale Kalthor** - The War-Witness
**Title**: "The Burning Sentinel"  
**Age**: 487 years old  
**Role**: Combat support NPC, mobile artillery, boss fight (if players attack Draconid interests)

#### Physical Description
- **Height**: 22 feet, built like a walking fortress
- **Appearance**: 50% calcified - still mobile, but his movements are **slow and deliberate** (like animated stone)
- **Horns**: Short, blunt, covered in **scorch marks** (he still uses his breath weapon frequently)
- **Eyes**: Molten ruby gemstones that **glow when he's about to attack**
- **Armor**: Wears armor made from **dragon scales** (actual dragon hide grafted onto his calcifying skin)
- **Weapon**: Carries a **dragon bone greatsword** (15 feet long, carved from a dragon's femur)

#### Unique Traits
- **Draconic Breath (Active)**: Unlike most Draconids, Kalthor can still breathe fire. Massive AoE cone attack (6 hexes, 8 damage, ignores cover)
- **Fossilized Resilience**: Takes **half damage from physical attacks** (his stone skin is armor). Full damage from magic/Void
- **War-Scarred**: Kalthor fought in the **Second Cataclysm** (Year -10,000). He has permanent scars from battles against entities players have never seen
- **Mobile but Slow**: Moves 2 hexes per turn (half speed of normal Caskets), but hits like a siege weapon

#### Story Hooks
- **Mercenary**: Kalthor can be hired as **temporary support** (costs 500 Credits per mission). He fights alongside players, uses his AI behavior deck
- **Boss Fight**: If players attack Skyhold Archives or harm Vyrnathrax, Kalthor awakens and becomes a **raid boss** (high HP, devastating attacks, only appears once)
- **Training Dummy**: Kalthor offers to **spar with players** (non-lethal combat practice). Beating him unlocks a unique card
- **The Last Warrior**: Kalthor knows he's the **last Draconid who can still fight**. When he fully petrifies, there will be no more Draconid warriors. He's trying to teach others his techniques before he's gone

#### AI Behavior Deck (Ally Mode)
- **Priority**: Tank hits for players (intercepts attacks on allies within 3 hexes)
- **Breath Weapon**: Uses once per combat when 3+ enemies are grouped
- **Greatsword Slam**: High damage single-target attack (6 damage, push 2 hexes)
- **Fossilized Bulwark**: Gives adjacent allies +2 Defense (he's a walking wall)

### 3. **Duskwind the Fatalist** - The Sleeper
**Title**: "The Dream-Lost"  
**Age**: 731 years old (oldest living Draconid)  
**Role**: Mystery NPC, hidden lore source, potential final boss (if players pursue "wrong" ending)

#### Physical Description
- **Height**: 26 feet (tallest Draconid)
- **Appearance**: **90% petrified** - looks like a statue. Only his head remains semi-mobile
- **Location**: Hidden deep in the Sibarian Wastes, sitting cross-legged in a meditation pose. Players must find him (he's a secret encounter)
- **Horns**: Absolutely massive, **glowing with every memory he's ever witnessed**. Looking directly at them causes players to see **visions of apocalypses**
- **Eyes**: Empty sockets leaking **liquid diamond** (he's crying crystal tears)
- **State**: In **eternal hibernation**. Asleep for 300 years. Players must complete a ritual to wake him (or leave him sleeping)

#### Unique Traits
- **Prophetic Madness**: Duskwind has seen **too much**. He's witnessed three apocalypses and dreamed of the fourth. He's gone insane from the weight of knowledge
- **The Fourth Ending Theory**: Duskwind believes the only way to break the cycle is to **cause the Fourth Ending NOW** (destroy the Engine completely, regardless of consequences)
- **Dream Manipulation**: If woken, Duskwind can alter players' perception of reality (debuff attacks, confusion effects, mind games)
- **The Final Petrification**: If players wake Duskwind, he will **complete his calcification within 24 hours** (his body gives up). He has one day to pass on his knowledge before becoming a statue

#### Story Hooks
- **Hidden Lore Boss**: Finding Duskwind is a **secret quest chain**. Requires translating ancient texts, following map fragments, exploring the most dangerous part of the Wastes
- **Moral Choice**: Wake him or leave him sleeping?
  - **Wake him**: Get critical lore about breaking the cycle, but he dies (petrifies) immediately after
  - **Leave him sleeping**: He remains as a potential ally for future playthroughs, but players miss lore
- **The Dangerous Knowledge**: Duskwind reveals that **Theslar's Engine can be reactivated** to cause a controlled Fourth Ending (restart the cycle cleanly instead of letting it rot). Some factions want this. Others are horrified
- **Final Boss Variant**: If players pursue the "Fourth Ending" route (destroy everything to restart), Kalthor and other factions will try to stop them. Duskwind becomes an ally in this route

#### AI Behavior Deck (Boss Mode - If Hostile)
- **Reality Fracture**: AOE confusion effect (all units in 5 hexes must roll to avoid attacking random targets)
- **Crystalline Cascade**: Ranged attack that creates **difficult terrain** (calcified ground, slows movement)
- **Ancestral Summons**: Calls **dragon ghost echoes** (minor adds, 3 HP each, swarm players)
- **Petrifying Gaze**: Stun 1 target for 1 turn (they're briefly calcified)

## THEMATIC ROLE IN CAMPAIGN

**Draconids as Arbiters**:
- Players discover them mid-campaign (after 5-10 missions)
- Skyhold Archives becomes a **neutral hub** for faction negotiations
- Vyrnathrax judges disputes (if two players are from hostile factions, he enforces ceasefire in Archives)

**Draconids as Tragedy**:
- Players watch Vyrnathrax slowly petrify over the campaign
- By endgame, his voice is slower, his movements stiffer
- Final cutscene: Vyrnathrax completes petrification, becomes a statue holding his memory crystal
- Players must decide: Take the crystal (preserve knowledge) or leave it (let history die with him)

**Draconids as Secret Option**:
- Finding Duskwind unlocks the **"Fourth Ending" campaign branch**
- Players can choose to destroy the Engine completely (restart the cycle cleanly)
- This ending is controversial (some factions support it, others violently oppose)

---

This makes the Draconids feel **mythical and rare** - players encounter them maybe 2-3 times per full campaign, and every encounter is **significant**. They're not playable, but they're **unforgettable**. Want me to add more iconic Draconids, or expand their behavior decks?
