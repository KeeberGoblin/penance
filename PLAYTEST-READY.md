## Critical Decisions Made

### Turn Structure: **SP-Based Turns** ✓
- Each player spends their SP pool on multiple cards per turn
- Turns taken sequentially in initiative order
- Allows combo plays and strategic sequencing
- Better fits deck-building identity

### Combat Resolution: **Hybrid Hit System** ✓
- **Melee**: Auto-hit (adjacent = hard to miss)
- **Ranged**: 1d6, 4+ to hit (modified by range/cover)
- **Magic**: Auto-hit (magic seeks target)
- **Defense** = damage reduction (minimum 1 damage always dealt)

### Deck Construction: **Fixed Base + Equipment Variance** ✓
- Scout: 22-26 cards (10 Universal + 12-16 equipment)
- Heavy: 32-38 cards (10 Universal + 22-28 equipment)
- Max 2 copies per card
- Equipment adds fixed number of cards (Longsword +4, Shield +3, etc.)

## How to Playtest (Step-by-Step)

### Preparation (15 minutes)

1. **Print Materials**:
   - [quick-reference.md](docs/quick-reference.md) (1 copy per player)
   - [universal-cards.md](docs/universal-cards.md) (for card reference)
   - [equipment-catalog.md](docs/equipment-catalog.md) (for weapon stats)

2. **Build Decks**:
   - Use [deck-construction.md](docs/deck-construction.md) templates
   - **Recommended starter builds**:
     - **Scout**: Dual Daggers + Jump Jets + Vents (22 cards)
     - **Heavy**: Warhammer + Tower Shield + Ablative Plating + Vents + Repair Kit (28 cards)

3. **Set Up Board**:
   - Use [arena-scenarios.md](docs/arena-scenarios.md) "First Blood" scenario
   - 7x7 hex grid (can use paper, dry-erase grid, or Tabletop Simulator)
   - Place terrain: Center elevated hex, 4 rubble hexes

4. **Prep Tokens**:
   - Heat tokens (dice, coins, or beads)
   - Taint tokens (different color)
   - SP tracker (dial or paper)

---

### Playtest Session (60-90 minutes)

**Start with Tutorial Mode** ([arena-scenarios.md](docs/arena-scenarios.md#scenario-1)):
- First 2 rounds: No Danger Zone (practice Safe Zone SP)
- Round 3+: Full rules

**Track These Metrics**:
- ☐ How long did each round take? (goal: 5-10 min per round)
- ☐ Did you understand all rules without re-reading?
- ☐ Which rules caused confusion?
- ☐ Was combat resolution fast or slow?
- ☐ Did facing/positioning matter?
- ☐ Was Heat management interesting or tedious?
- ☐ Did the game end too quickly or drag?

**Note Everything**:
- Rules questions that came up
- Cards that felt too strong/weak
- Moments that were exciting vs boring
- Any calculations that slowed play

---

### After Playtest (30 minutes)

**Answer These Questions**:

1. **Fun Factor** (1-10): How fun was it?
2. **Clarity** (1-10): How clear were the rules?
3. **Balance**: Did one deck feel stronger?
4. **Pacing**: Too fast? Too slow? Just right?
5. **Tension**: Were decisions interesting?
6. **Theme**: Did it feel like piloting mechs in combat?

**Identify Issues**:
- Rules that need clarification
- Cards that need rebalancing
- Mechanics that were clunky
- Math that was tedious

## Known Gaps (For Later)

### Not Critical for Playtest:
- ❌ Full equipment catalog (only 10 items, but enough for testing)
- ❌ All 7 races (Human and Dwarf examples given, test those first)
- ❌ Monster AI decks (PvP first, AI later)
- ❌ Campaign progression (Arena mode first)
- ❌ 3D printable models (proxies fine for testing)

### Can Add After First Playtest:
- More equipment (15-20 total goal)
- More scenarios (4 provided, expand based on feedback)
- Damage card designs (examples given, full set later)
- Terrain expansion (8 types provided, add more if needed)

---

## Suggested Playtest Sequence

### Session 1: **Core Mechanics** (Scout vs Heavy, First Blood scenario)
**Focus**: Turn structure, SP economy, basic combat
**Duration**: 60 min
**Goal**: Verify core loop is fun

### Session 2: **Terrain & Positioning** (Same builds, King of the Hill scenario)
**Focus**: Elevated terrain, objectives, facing/flanking
**Duration**: 90 min
**Goal**: Verify positioning matters

### Session 3: **Different Builds** (Try other equipment combinations)
**Focus**: Deck variety, equipment balance
**Duration**: 60 min
**Goal**: Verify multiple viable strategies

### Session 4: **Solo/Co-op** (Gauntlet Run scenario)
**Focus**: AI turrets, time pressure, solo play
**Duration**: 45 min
**Goal**: Verify solo mode works

## What to Expect

### First Playtest Will Be Slow (That's OK!)
- Expect 2-3 hour session for first game
- Lots of rule lookups
- Calculation mistakes
- Confusion about timing

**This is normal!** Take notes, adjust, repeat.

### Second Playtest Will Be Faster
- ~60-90 minutes
- Smoother gameplay
- Fewer lookups
- More tactical decisions

### Third Playtest Will Feel Good
- ~45-60 minutes
- Rules internalized
- Strategic depth emerges
- You'll know if it's fun

---

## Balancing Expectations

### What's Playable:
✅ Core combat loop (SP, Heat, attacks, damage)
✅ Deck-as-health system (discard = damage)
✅ Positioning tactics (facing, terrain, flanking)
✅ Equipment variety (10 items = enough for testing)
✅ Victory conditions (disable enemy or VP)

### What's Not Fully Defined:
❌ All racial abilities (examples given, not all 7 races complete)
❌ Monster AI (templates exist, not full decks)
❌ Campaign progression (Workshop costs stated, full system not detailed)
❌ Advanced terrain (8 types done, could expand)
❌ Full equipment catalog (10 items done, 20-30 needed for final)

**But you can playtest PvP Arena mode RIGHT NOW!**

---

## Success Criteria

**Your playtest is successful if**:
- [ ] You finished a complete game (someone won)
- [ ] You understood 80%+ of rules without constant lookup
- [ ] Combat felt tactical (positioning mattered)
- [ ] Decisions felt meaningful (not just "play all cards")
- [ ] Players want to play again (fun factor!)

**If you hit those 5 points, the core is solid.** Everything else is iteration.
