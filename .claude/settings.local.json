      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nAdd comprehensive playtest readiness assessment\n\nAssessment Summary: 70% Ready for Alpha Playtest\n\nWhat''s Complete (Strong Foundation):\n- World-building & lore (437-year timeline, 9 factions)\n- Asymmetric faction design (36 unique Caskets, complete)\n- Puppeteer capsule system (body horror control interface)\n- Leg-skimming progression (permanent sacrifice mechanics)\n- Deck-building v2.0 (5-choose-3 GKR-style tactics)\n- Campaign systems (settlements, pilot scars, loot, relationships)\n- Boss encounters (HP deck system)\n- AI art generation guide (comprehensive prompts)\n\nCritical Gaps Blocking Playtest:\n1. Combat resolution system (no clear attack→damage flow)\n2. Turn structure (unclear if card-based or SP-based)\n3. Deck construction rules (no exact sizes or card limits)\n4. Range/LOS rules (vague, no diagrams)\n5. Equipment catalog (examples exist, need full list)\n6. Quick reference sheet (nothing printable)\n7. Example of play (no walkthrough)\n\nRecommended Path to Playtest (24 hours of work):\n\nWEEK 1 (11 hours):\n- Write combat resolution rules (step-by-step flowchart)\n- Finalize turn structure (SP-based recommended)\n- Create deck construction rules (exact sizes/limits)\n- Write range/LOS rules (with hex diagrams)\n- Create quick reference sheet (1-page printable)\n\nWEEK 2 (13 hours):\n- Expand equipment catalog (10 weapons, 40+ cards)\n- Write example of play (2-page walkthrough)\n- Create Arena scenario (map, pre-built decks)\n\nWEEK 3:\n- First playtest (1v1 Arena match)\n- Iterate based on feedback\n- Second playtest\n\nSpecific Documents Needed:\n1. combat-resolution-detailed.md (CRITICAL)\n2. turn-structure-final.md (CRITICAL)\n3. deck-construction-rules.md (CRITICAL)\n4. range-and-los-rules.md (HIGH PRIORITY)\n5. quick-reference-sheet.md (HIGH PRIORITY)\n6. equipment-catalog-starter.md (MEDIUM)\n7. example-of-play.md (MEDIUM)\n8. arena-scenario-01.md (MEDIUM)\n\nBottom Line:\n\"You've built an incredible world, faction system, and progression \nmechanics. What you need now is tactical crunch—the turn-by-turn, \ncard-by-card combat system. That's 24 hours of work away.\"\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nImplement GKR + KDM hybrid combat system\n\nMajor System Overhaul: Deck-as-HP with Brutal Consequences\n\nCore Mechanics (GKR-Inspired):\n- 30-card deck = your HP (discard cards when damaged)\n- Deck composition: 10 Universal + 12 Primary + 6 Secondary + 2 Tactics\n- SP refresh each turn (6/5/4/3 depending on frame weight)\n- Fixed deck (no mid-game deck-building)\n- Hand size: 6 cards\n\nDual-Layer Damage System:\n1. Casket HP Deck (30 cards) - Mech structural integrity\n2. Pilot Wound Deck (10 cards) - Pilot physical/mental state\n\nComponent Damage (KDM-Inspired Brutality):\n- When you discard Primary Weapon cards from damage → Component Damage\n- 3 Component Damage to same location → Component Destroyed\n- Destroyed components have permanent effects:\n  - Right Arm destroyed = lose all Primary Weapon cards from hand\n  - Left Arm = lose Secondary Equipment\n  - Legs = movement costs +1 SP per hex\n  - Head = -1 to ranged attacks, no sensors\n  - Chassis = permanent -1 SP maximum\n\nDeath Spiral Mechanic:\n- When deck empties, reshuffle discard pile\n- Add 1 \"Damage\" card (dead draw) to deck\n- After 3-4 reshuffles, deck is 30% useless cards\n- Creates KDM-style inevitable decline\n\nPilot Wound Deck (10 Cards):\n- Separate from Casket HP\n- Flip 1 card when pilot takes damage:\n  - Capsule breach\n  - Neural feedback (5+ Component Damage)\n  - Thread snap\n  - Taint overload\n  - Casket destruction\n- Wound effects:\n  - Minor Injury (5 cards): Temporary debuffs\n  - Severe Injury (3 cards): PERMANENT effects (broken hand, spinal trauma)\n  - Trauma (2 cards): Mental breakdowns (PTSD, dissociation)\n- All 10 Wounds = Pilot Death\n\nDeck Composition Ratios:\n- Universal Core (10 cards): Movement, defense, utility - EVERYONE has these\n- Primary Weapon (12 cards): Faction-specific, defines playstyle\n  - Example: Church \"Penitent Blades\" = self-harm + martyrdom\n  - Cannot be changed (built into Casket chassis)\n- Secondary Equipment (6 cards): Player choice\n  - Buckler Shield, Tower Shield, Repair Kit, Pistol, etc.\n- Faction Tactics (2 cards): Choose 2 from 5 available\n  - Pre-battle deck customization (GKR-style)\n\nSP Economy by Frame:\n- Light Caskets: 6 SP (many small actions, speed)\n- Medium Caskets: 5 SP (balanced)\n- Heavy Caskets: 4 SP (fewer but powerful actions)\n- Assault Caskets: 3 SP (pure overwhelming force)\n\nHeat System Integration:\n- Safe Zone (0-4 Heat): No penalties\n- Danger Zone (5+ Heat): Roll Strain at turn start\n- Strain failures: lose SP, take damage, component malfunctions\n\nExample Combat Flow:\n1. Attack deals 6 damage\n2. Defender discards top 6 cards from deck\n3. If 3+ Primary Weapon cards discarded → Component Destroyed\n4. Defender loses all Primary Weapon cards from hand\n5. Forced to fight with only Universal + Secondary cards\n6. Desperate, brutal, Kingdom Death-style spiral\n\nDesign Philosophy:\n- GKR''s elegant deck-as-HP clarity\n- KDM''s brutal permanent consequences  \n- Penance''s body horror (losing Primary = losing limbs)\n- Creates desperate, tactical combat where EVERY card matters\n- Damage isn''t just numbers—it''s dismemberment\n\nFiles Created:\n- docs/combat-damage-system-gkr-style.md (complete system spec)\n\nThis replaces vague combat descriptions with concrete, playable rules.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
