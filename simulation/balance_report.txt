================================================================================
BALANCE OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

1. FACTION BALANCE:
   - Church (Self-Harm): High burst damage but self-destructive
   - Dwarves (Runes): Slow ramp-up but strong late game
   - Ossuarium (Lifesteal): Sustain-focused, hard to kill
   - Elves (Bleed): DoT-based, scales with fight length

2. CASKET CLASS BALANCE:
   - Scout (6 SP): Fast cycling, high actions per turn
   - Assault (5 SP): Balanced
   - Heavy (4 SP): Tankier, fewer actions
   - Fortress (3 SP): Very tanky, slow

3. POTENTIAL ISSUES:
   - Church may kill themselves too quickly
   - Ossuarium lifesteal may be too strong in long fights
   - Fortress class may struggle against kiting
   - Bleed stacking may need cap to prevent runaway scaling

4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Test Church self-harm: limit to 1 use per turn
   - Cap Bleed counters at 10
   - Add mobility options for Fortress class
   - Consider Lifesteal diminishing returns after 10 HP healed
