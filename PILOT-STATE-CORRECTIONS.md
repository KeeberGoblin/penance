# Pilot State Corrections for Illuminated Manuscript Prompts

**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Issue**: Initial manuscript prompts incorrectly depicted ALL pilots as skeletons
**Source**: [docs/reference/casket-control-system.md](docs/reference/casket-control-system.md)

## The Lore Correction

### What Pilots Actually Are

Pilots are called **"Remnants"** - beings who exist in a state between life and death after the Sundering (Cataclysm). However, their physical appearance varies significantly by faction.

**Key Quote** (casket-control-system.md, line 400):
> "The Remnants are dead. Dead things don't have working nerves."

This means they are **dead or near-death**, but NOT necessarily skeletons.

---

## Correct Pilot States by Faction

### 1. Church of Absolution
**State**: **Corpse-like but FLESH INTACT**
- Pale, deathly appearance (not skeletal)
- Recent dead (days to weeks, not centuries)
- Bleeding stigmata wounds (requires flesh)
- Wearing cilice (spiked belt) for constant pain
- Face gaunt but recognizable
- Eyes closed (sensory deprivation, sees through Casket sensors)

**Source** (casket-control-system.md, lines 141-149):
> "Threads are black (soaked in sanctified oil). Pilot wears a cilice (spiked belt) inside
> capsule for constant pain. Fluid contains diluted blessed water (stings open wounds)."

**Correction Needed**: Change "skeletal figure" to "pale corpse-like figure with flesh intact"

---

### 2. Dwarven Forge-Guilds
**State**: **PRAGMATIC CORPSE PRESERVATION** (likely skeleton due to efficiency)
- Industrial approach to death
- Reinforced threads with copper wire (most durable)
- Diagnostic readouts visible
- Ejectable capsule (safety-focused)

**Source** (casket-control-system.md, lines 165-173):
> "Threads are reinforced with copper wire (most durable). Fluid is industrial coolant (clear,
> chemical smell). Capsule has diagnostic readouts visible from inside."

**Note**: Dwarves likely ARE skeletal (flesh removed for efficiency/longevity), so manuscript
prompt is CORRECT for this faction.

---

### 3. The Ossuarium (UNDEAD)
**State**: **PRESERVED CORPSE OR PARTIAL SKELETON** (variable)
- **Explicitly stated**: "Pilot may be partially skeletal (flesh optional)"
- Embalming fluid keeps body from decaying further
- Cold capsule (refrigerated)
- Threads attach to exposed bone directly (no nerve pain - already dead)

**Source** (casket-control-system.md, lines 177-184):
> "Threads are necrotic black (dead tissue, but still conductive). Fluid is embalming
> solution (keeps pilot's body from decaying further). Pilot may be partially skeletal
> (flesh optional). Threads attach to exposed bone directly (no nerve pain—already dead)."

**Note**: Ossuarium can be skeletal OR preserved corpse - manuscript prompt showing "preserved
corpse" is CORRECT.

---

### 4. Elven Verdant Covenant
**State**: **SEMI-MUMMIFIED / PRESERVED BY SAP** (NOT skeleton)
- Green-white threads (organically grown, not surgically implanted)
- Sap-based fluid (amber, sticky, preservative)
- Body slowly preserved by sap (semi-mummified over decades)
- Bark-lined capsule interior
- Threads connect to temples and spine (not just fingers)

**Source** (casket-control-system.md, lines 152-162):
> "Threads are green-white (organically grown, not surgically implanted). Fluid is sap-based
> (amber, sticky, preservative). Capsule interior lined with living bark. Pilot's body is
> slowly preserved by the sap (semi-mummified over decades)."

**Correction Needed**: Change "elven skeleton" to "semi-mummified elf preserved in amber sap"

---

## Summary of Corrections Needed

| Faction | Original Prompt | Should Be | Correct? |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Church | "Skeletal figure in priest robes" | "Pale corpse with flesh intact, bleeding stigmata" | ❌ WRONG |
| Dwarves | "Dwarven skeleton with beard" | "Dwarven skeleton" (likely correct) | ✅ LIKELY CORRECT |
| Ossuarium | "Preserved corpse (not skeleton)" | "Preserved corpse OR partial skeleton (variable)" | ✅ CORRECT |
| Elves | "Elven skeleton with graceful bones" | "Semi-mummified elf preserved in amber sap" | ❌ WRONG |

## Revised Pilot Descriptions

### Church of Absolution (CORRECTED)

**OLD**:
```
PILOT:
- Skeletal figure in tattered priest robes
- Crown of thorns piercing skull
- Golden neural threads extending from spine like divine light rays
- Hands clasped in prayer position despite impalement
- Ribs showing through torn vestments with bleeding stigmata wounds
```

**NEW**:
```
PILOT:
- Pale, corpse-like figure in tattered priest robes (flesh intact but deathly)
- Crown of thorns piercing head, drawing blood from scalp
- Golden neural threads (black with sanctified oil) extending from fingertips through nail beds
- Hands bound across chest in mummy's death pose (arms crossed, left over right)
- Bleeding stigmata wounds on palms, side ribcage, and feet (requires flesh)
- Eyes closed, face gaunt but still recognizable (recent dead, not ancient)
- Cilice (spiked belt) visible beneath robes
- Floating in amber Neural Fluid (blessed water-tinted)
```

---

### Dwarven Forge-Guilds (NO CHANGE NEEDED)

**CURRENT** (already correct):
```
PILOT:
- Stocky dwarven skeleton with magnificent braided beard (ossified but intact)
- Master smith's leather apron and thick gauntlets
- Golden neural threads (reinforced with copper wire) connecting to fingertips
- Monocle lens still affixed to skull socket (magnification for rune-reading)
- Hammer and chisel crossed on lap
- Diagnostic readouts reflected in eye sockets
- Floating in clear industrial coolant
```

---

### The Ossuarium (NO CHANGE NEEDED)

**CURRENT** (already correct - shows preserved corpse variant):
```
PILOT:
- Perfectly preserved corpse (not skeleton - flesh intact but pale)
- Black burial shroud with gold thread embroidery
- Eyes open but milky-white (cataract glaze)
- Golden neural threads (necrotic black) piercing flesh like sutures
- Hands crossed over chest in funeral repose
- Crown of black roses on head (wilted but not fully dead)
- Floating in embalming fluid (cold, preservative)
```

---

### Elven Verdant Covenant (CORRECTED)

**OLD**:
```
PILOT:
- Elven skeleton with elongated graceful bones
- Withered flower crown (seasonal blooms now dry)
- Green tattered cloak made from woven leaves (preserved like pressed flowers)
- Golden neural threads sprouting like plant shoots from spine
- Fingers still elegant despite being bare bone
- Pose: Drawing invisible bowstring (eternal hunt)
```

**NEW**:
```
PILOT:
- Semi-mummified elf with amber-preserved flesh (like tree resin encasement)
- Skin has bark-like texture (partially wooden)
- Withered flower crown woven into hair (seasonal blooms preserved)
- Green-white neural threads sprouting organically from fingertips, temples, and spine
- Threads look like plant roots, not metal (living tissue, not surgical)
- Tattered cloak made from woven leaves (pressed and preserved like herbarium specimen)
- Eyes closed, face serene but alien (plant-human hybrid appearance)
- Pose: Arms bound across chest, hands positioned as if holding invisible bow
- Floating in amber sap-fluid (sticky, thick, honey-colored)
- Capsule interior shows living bark growing inward (pilot partially fused with walls)
```

## Visual Description Guide for AI Generators

### Church Pilots: "The Penitent Corpse"
- **Reference**: Catholic saint relics (incorruptible bodies)
- **Appearance**: Fresh corpse (1-2 weeks dead max)
- **Key Features**: Pale skin, closed eyes, bleeding wounds, bound arms
- **NOT**: Skeleton, skull, bare bone

### Dwarven Pilots: "The Efficient Remains"
- **Reference**: Museum skeleton displays with tools
- **Appearance**: Clean skeleton (flesh removed for longevity)
- **Key Features**: Intact beard (ossified), smithing gear, monocle
- **CORRECT**: Skeleton is accurate for pragmatic Dwarven culture

### Ossuarium Pilots: "The Preserved Noble"
- **Reference**: Victorian funeral portraits, embalmed bodies
- **Appearance**: Perfectly preserved corpse (aristocratic death)
- **Key Features**: Pale but intact flesh, burial shroud, funeral pose
- **NOT**: Skeleton (Ossuarium PRESERVES bodies, not strips them)

### Elven Pilots: "The Amber Mummy"
- **Reference**: Bog bodies, tree resin fossils, Egyptian mummies
- **Appearance**: Semi-mummified with plant-like features
- **Key Features**: Amber-tinted skin, bark texture, root-threads, sap encasement
- **NOT**: Skeleton with bones (Elves are PRESERVED by sap over decades)

## Thematic Reasons for These States

### Why Church Pilots Aren't Skeletons
- **Suffering requires flesh**: Can't have bleeding stigmata on bones
- **Recent martyrdom**: Church views piloting as immediate penance (fresh dead)
- **Body horror emphasis**: Corpse with threads piercing flesh is more disturbing than clean skeleton

### Why Dwarves MIGHT Be Skeletons
- **Engineering efficiency**: Flesh decays, bone lasts (pragmatic choice)
- **Maintenance**: Easier to service threads on bare bone than through rotting flesh
- **Cultural**: Dwarves don't care about aesthetics, only function

### Why Ossuarium Aren't Skeletons
- **Aristocratic pride**: Undead nobility preserve their beauty
- **Embalming mastery**: They're necromancers - preservation is their expertise
- **Eternal vanity**: Why be skeleton when you can be eternal corpse-king?

### Why Elves Aren't Skeletons
- **Sap preservation**: Their fluid literally mummifies them over time
- **Nature fusion**: Becoming part-plant, not decaying to bone
- **Long-term pilots**: Decades in capsule = gradual transformation, not decomposition

**END OF DOCUMENT**

The illuminated manuscript prompts need corrections to accurately reflect that:
1. Church pilots are CORPSES WITH FLESH (bleeding stigmata requires flesh)
2. Elven pilots are SEMI-MUMMIFIED IN SAP (preserved over decades, not decomposed to bone)
3. Only Dwarves and potentially Ossuarium have skeletal pilots (efficiency/optional)
