# Deck Building System v2.0
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

Version: 2.0
Last Updated: October 10, 2025

## Core Philosophy

**Your deck IS your Casket.** But unlike other deck-builders, you don't bring everything you own. You make hard choices about what equipment and tactics to bring into battle.

Inspired by GKR: Heavy Hitters' command card system - you have access to more cards than you can bring, forcing strategic pre-battle decisions.

---

## Deck Construction Rules

### Step 1: Choose Your Casket

Pick faction and Casket type (e.g., Church Confessor, Undead Revenant, Dwarven Ironclad).

This determines:
- Base stats (SP, Movement, Armor, Deck Size)
- Faction-specific card pool access
- Equipment slot configuration

### Step 2: Build Your Deck (Fixed Components)

**Every deck contains**:

**A) Universal Core (10 cards)** - MANDATORY, cannot be changed
- 3x Movement cards
- 3x Defense cards
- 3x Utility cards
- 1x Emergency card

These represent basic Casket functions. Every pilot has these.

**B) Weapon Cards** - Determined by equipment loadout
- Right Arm weapon adds 4-6 cards
- Left Arm weapon/shield adds 3-5 cards
- Cards are weapon-specific (longsword cards ≠ warhammer cards)

**C) Relic Cards** - Determined by equipped relics (0-3 slots depending on Casket)
- Each relic adds 2-3 cards
- Powerful but limited uses

### Step 3: Choose Faction Tactics (DECK-BUILDING CHOICE)

**Faction Card Pool**: Each faction has 5 unique tactical cards available

**Deck-Building Rule**: Choose 3 of the 5 to bring into battle

**Why this matters**:
- Forces specialization (can't bring everything)
- Allows counter-play (scout enemy faction, pick tactics that counter them)
- Creates variety (same Casket, different builds)
- Rewards mastery (knowing when to bring which 3)

**Example - Church of Absolution Tactics**:

Available pool (5 cards):
1. **Blood Offering** - Self-harm for damage boost
2. **Righteous Fury** - Momentum-based damage scaling
3. **Martyrdom Protocol** - Redirect ally damage to self
4. **Divine Judgment** - Execute low-HP enemies
5. **Consecrated Ground** - Create healing zones

You pick 3 before battle. Can't change mid-mission.

## Faction Tactics Design

Each faction's 5 tactical cards reinforce their identity:

**Church**: Self-sacrifice, ally protection, punishment of the guilty
**Elves**: Terrain manipulation, regeneration, nature magic
**Dwarves**: Rune buffs, armor sundering, scrap harvesting
**Undead**: Resurrection, life drain, thrall summoning
**Fae**: Illusions, teleportation, mind games
**Nomads**: Scavenging, mobility, improvisation
**Merchants**: Credit economy, hired guns, trading
**Blighted**: Mutation, pack tactics, predatory instincts
**Chitinous**: Hive coordination, swarm tactics, suicide units

---

## Total Deck Size Breakdown

**Example: Church Confessor with Longsword + Buckler**

- Universal Core: 10 cards
- Longsword (Right Arm): 5 cards
- Buckler (Left Arm): 3 cards
- Relic Slot (Jump Jets): 2 cards
- **Faction Tactics: 3 cards** (chosen from 5 available)

**Total Deck: 23 cards**

When you take damage, damage cards are added to this deck (clogging it).

## Deck-Building Strategy

### The Choice Matters

**Scenario**: You're playing Church Confessor against Undead Court boss.

**Available Tactics**:
1. Blood Offering (burst damage)
2. Righteous Fury (momentum)
3. Martyrdom Protocol (protection)
4. Divine Judgment (execute)
5. Consecrated Ground (area control)

**You can only bring 3. What do you choose?**

**Aggressive Build**: Blood Offering, Righteous Fury, Divine Judgment
- Focus: Kill fast, snowball Wrath tokens, execute wounded
- Risk: No protection, no area control
- Best for: Solo missions, speed runs

**Tank Build**: Martyrdom Protocol, Consecrated Ground, Divine Judgment
- Focus: Protect team, create safe zones, clean up kills
- Risk: Lower personal damage
- Best for: Team missions, escort objectives

**Balanced Build**: Blood Offering, Righteous Fury, Martyrdom Protocol
- Focus: Flexible damage + emergency protection
- Risk: No execute, no area control
- Best for: Unknown missions, first playthrough

## Why This System Works

**1. Meaningful Pre-Battle Choices**
- Can't bring everything
- Must predict what you'll need
- Rewards mission knowledge

**2. Build Diversity**
- Same Casket + equipment can play 10 different ways
- 5-choose-3 = 10 possible combinations per faction

**3. Counter-Play Potential**
- See enemy faction? Pick counters.
- Church bringing Consecrated Ground? Bring mobility.
- Fae bringing teleports? Bring AOE.

**4. Mastery Curve**
- New players: Bring what sounds cool
- Intermediate: Bring synergistic combos
- Expert: Counter-pick based on mission/enemies

**5. Expansion-Ready**
- Add more faction tactics (5 becomes 7, still choose 3)
- Add "Advanced Tactics" (unlock after campaign progress)
- Add "Relic Tactics" (unique cards from rare loot)

---

## Comparison to Other Systems

**vs. Living Card Games (Netrunner, etc.)**:
- Penance: Fixed core + choose 3 from 5
- LCG: Choose 45 from 200+
- Penance is faster, less overwhelming

**vs. GKR: Heavy Hitters**:
- Both use "choose X from Y" system
- Penance adds equipment cards on top
- More complexity, but more customization

**vs. Kingdom Death: Monster**:
- KDM: Gear determines your options
- Penance: Gear + Tactics determine options
- Penance adds pre-battle strategic layer

---

## Implementation for Playtesting

**Print Requirements**:

For each player:
- 10x Universal cards (every deck has these)
- 20-25x Weapon/equipment cards (depends on loadout)
- 5x Faction Tactic cards (print all 5, choose 3 each mission)
- 10-15x Damage cards (added when taking hits)

**Deck Tracking**:
- Use deckbox dividers to separate "Available Tactics" from "Brought Tactics"
- Before mission: Choose 3 Tactic cards, put in deck
- After mission: Return all Tactics to pool, choose fresh for next mission

---

## Next Steps

**For Full Game**:

1. Design all 5 Tactics for each of 9 factions (45 cards total)
2. Create weapon cards for ~20 weapon types
3. Balance testing (are some Tactics always picked? Buff the others)
4. Advanced Tactics (unlock via campaign progression)

**For Playtest**:

1. Start with Church + Undead (2 factions = 10 Tactic cards)
2. Test if 5-choose-3 feels good (maybe it should be 6-choose-3?)
3. Verify Tactics don't overlap with weapon effects too much
