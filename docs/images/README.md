# Favicon Setup

## Required File

Please save your brazier/flame altar icon as:
- **`favicon.png`** (recommended size: 64x64 pixels or 32x32 pixels)

## Image Requirements

- **Format:** PNG (supports transparency)
- **Recommended Size:** 64x64 pixels (will scale for different uses)
- **Background:** Transparent or matching the aged parchment aesthetic
- **Content:** The brazier/flame altar icon from your uploaded image

## How to Add the Favicon

1. Crop your brazier image to a square format
2. Resize to 64x64 pixels (or 32x32 pixels)
3. Save as `favicon.png` in this directory (`docs/images/`)
4. The HTML files are already configured to use it

## Current Setup

The favicon links have been added to:
- `/docs/index.html` (main site)
- `/docs/codex/index.html` (codex navigation)

All codex content pages inherit the favicon from the main index.html iframe.
