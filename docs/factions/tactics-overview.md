## Design Philosophy

Each faction has **5 unique tactical cards**. Before each battle, you choose **3 to bring**.

**Why 5-choose-3**:
- Forces specialization (can't do everything)
- Creates 10 possible build combinations per faction
- Allows counter-play and meta-gaming
- Rewards system mastery

**Card Design Rules**:
- Must reinforce faction identity
- No overlap with universal cards
- Each should excel in specific scenarios
- Some synergize, some are situational

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations**:

1. **Passive vs Active**: Each faction has 2-3 Passives, 2-3 Active abilities
2. **Synergy Web**: At least 3 cards should synergize with each other
3. **Situational Pick**: At least 1 card should be mission-specific (not always good)
4. **Build Diversity**: No single "best 3" - depends on mission and playstyle

**Testing Priority**:

1. Church + Undead (opposite philosophies, easiest to balance against each other)
2. Dwarves + Fae (tech vs magic, interesting contrast)
3. Others as needed

**Expansion Potential**:

- Add 2 more Tactics per faction (5 becomes 7, still choose 3)
- "Advanced Tactics" unlock via campaign
- "Legendary Tactics" from rare boss kills
