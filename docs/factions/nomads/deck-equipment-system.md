## DESIGN NOTES

### Balance Considerations
- **Mobility vs Damage**: High movement compensates for lower base damage than Church/Dwarves
- **Conditional Triggers**: Opportunist, Vulture's Eye, Wolves' Pact reward smart play
- **Self-Harm Costs**: Desperate Gamble, Improvised Explosive balanced by discard costs
- **Late-Game Scaling**: Survivor's Instinct prevents early domination, rewards survival

### Unique Mechanics
- **Free Actions**: Ghost Step doesn't cost SP (unique to Nomads)
- **Mid-Battle Salvage**: Scrapper, Marked for Salvage (resource generation from kills)
- **Conditional Damage**: Opportunist, Vulture's Eye (punish mistakes, finish wounded)
- **Deck Cycling**: More cycling options than any faction (Scavenger's Cunning, Winds of Change)

### Counterplay
- **Against Nomads**: Area denial, immobilize effects, multi-target attacks
- **Nomad Counters**: Elves (Root Bind), Dwarves (Earthshaker terrain), Church (auto-hit attacks)
