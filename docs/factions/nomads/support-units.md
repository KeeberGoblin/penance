## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Units?
Nomads are lean, mobile faction. They don't have standing armies. They improvise, scavenge, and adapt. Three units reflects this:
- **Salvage Crew**: Resourcefulness
- **Outriders**: Mobility
- **Caravan Walker**: Community

### Neutral Mercenaries
Nomads are encouraged to hire **Neutral Mercenary Units** (see: Neutral Support Units file) to supplement their forces. This reflects their philosophy:
- "Anyone can join the Collective"
- "Credits buy loyalty"
- "Adapt or die"
