## FACTION STRENGTHS

✅ **High burst damage** (Blood Offering + Divine Judgment)
✅ **Strong ally support** (Martyrdom Protocol, Consecrated Ground)
✅ **Scaling power** (Righteous Fury gets stronger each kill)
✅ **Flexible builds** (melee DPS, support tank, self-harm berserker)
✅ **Resource recursion** (Consecrated Ground, Repair Kit, Last Rites)

---

## FACTION WEAKNESSES

❌ **Self-destructive** (many cards harm you)
❌ **Heat management** (Tower Shield, Martyrdom Protocol generate Heat)
❌ **Reliant on allies** (several cards only work with allies present)
❌ **Low sustain** (without Repair Kit, you spiral down fast)
❌ **PTSD Trauma** (fear of rear attacks cripples aggressive play)

---

## TACTICAL TIPS

### Early Game (Turns 1-3):
- Use Blood Offering on turn 1 for alpha strike
- Position aggressively (you can tank with Martyrdom Protocol)
- Save Consecrated Ground until you're at ~15 HP

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6):
- Trade HP for position (you have healing)
- Use Divine Judgment as execute (when enemy at 10 HP)
- Protect allies with Martyrdom Protocol (build Righteous Fury stacks)

### Late Game (Turns 7+):
- If Righteous Fury is active: +3-4 damage, you win
- Use Flagellant's Zeal for last desperate push
- Absolution if Heat is critical (5 SP is expensive but worth it)

---

## COUNTER-PLAY (How to Beat Church)

🎯 **Target their HP deck early** (they rely on self-harm, accelerate it)
🎯 **Spread damage** (don't feed Righteous Fury kills)
🎯 **Attack from range** (Holy Pistol is weak, melee is dangerous)
🎯 **Destroy Right Arm early** (no Penitent Blades = no threat)
🎯 **Inflict Pilot Wounds** (PTSD ruins their aggression)
