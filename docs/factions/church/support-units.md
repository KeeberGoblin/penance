## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Theme First
Each unit represents Church doctrine:

- **Penitents**: Atonement through service
- **Relic Bearers**: Power of faith made manifest
- **Aspirant**: Trial before ascension
- **Choir**: Voice of the divine
- **Engine**: Walking cathedral of judgment

### Meaningful Trade-offs
Taking support units costs Equipment Slots:
- More support = Less personal power
- Creates strategic diversity
- Forces build decisions

### Progression Rewards
Unlock new units through campaign:
- Incentivizes long-term play
- Rewards mastery
- Creates sense of progression

### AI Complexity Curve
- **Starter units**: Simple behaviors (4-5 cards)
- **Unlockable units**: Complex behaviors (5-6 cards)
- **Elite unit**: Ultimate behaviors (4 cards but devastating)
