## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Units?
Church doctrine emphasizes personal trial and redemption. These 3 units represent:
- **Flagellant Pack**: Pain as path to absolution (self-sacrifice theme)
- **Penitent Squad**: Atonement through honorable service (disciplined fighters)
- **Relic Bearers**: Power of faith made manifest (zone control through relics)

Each unit offers distinct tactical approach while maintaining Church's martyrdom theme.
