## FACTION STRENGTHS

- High burst damage (Blood Offering + Divine Judgment)
- Strong ally support (Martyrdom Protocol, Consecrated Ground, Last Rites)
- Scaling power (Righteous Fury gets stronger with each kill)
- Flexible builds (melee DPS, ranged support, tank, berserker)
- Resource recursion (Consecrated Ground, Last Rites recover cards)

---

## FACTION WEAKNESSES

- Self-destructive (many abilities harm you)
- Heat management issues (Martyrdom Protocol, Tower Shield generate Heat)
- Reliant on allies for some mechanics (Last Rites, Martyrdom Protocol)
- Low sustain without Repair Sigil (self-harm spirals down fast)
- Vulnerable when isolated (support mechanics need allies)

---

## TACTICAL TIPS

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
- Use Blood Offering turn 1 for alpha strike
- Position aggressively (Martyrdom Protocol lets you tank for allies)
- Save Consecrated Ground until you're at ~15 HP

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
- Trade HP for positioning (you have healing)
- Use Divine Judgment as execute (when enemy at 10 HP or less)
- Protect allies with Martyrdom Protocol (builds Righteous Fury stacks)

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
- If Righteous Fury has +3-4 damage, you dominate
- Use Flagellant's Zeal for last desperate push
- Absolution if Heat is critical (5 SP expensive but worth it)

---

## COUNTER-PLAY (How to Beat Church)

- Target their HP early (they rely on self-harm, accelerate it)
- Spread damage (don't feed Righteous Fury kills)
- Attack from range (melee Church builds are most dangerous)
- Destroy Primary Weapon early (no weapon = no threat)
- Inflict Pilot Wounds (PTSD ruins their aggression)
- Isolate them from allies (many mechanics need team)

---
