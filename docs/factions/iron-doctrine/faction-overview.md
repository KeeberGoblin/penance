# The Iron Doctrine

**The Engine's Chosen - Bonus Secret Faction**

> *"The Wyrd twist reality for sport. The weak pray for mercy. We alone heard the Engine's truth: The world must be unified under its divine Pulse. Every track we lay is sacred ground. Every nation we connect is salvation. The heretics call it conquest. We call it blessing."*
> — High Conductor Maelis Ironbound, Sermon from the Locomotive Cathedral

---

## Faction Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Philosophy** | "The Engine's Will Made Manifest" - The Theslar Engine is divine. Its Pulse is holy command. All lands must be connected via Pulse Rails to receive its blessing. Expansion is sacred duty. Opposition is heresy. |
| **Population** | ~200,000 immortal souls bound to 13 Eternal Trains (never age, never truly die, cannot leave the railways) |
| **Territory** | The Sacred Network - 47,000 miles of Pulse Rails radiating from Theslar Engine + aggressive expansion into new territories (consume 500+ tons of scrap metal monthly to forge new tracks) |
| **Technology** | Void-Steam Engines - locomotives powered by siphoned Engine Pulse energy. Hybrid of industrial rail tech and eldritch corruption. |
| **Power Source** | Direct connection to Theslar Engine via "Pulse Rails" - crystalline tracks that conduct Void energy like electrical current |
| **Governance** | The Council of Conductors - 13 immortal train commanders, each bound to their Eternal Train for 437 years |
| **Religion** | Engine Absolutism - "The Theslar Engine is divine. The Pulse is holy command. We are its missionaries. Every track laid spreads its blessing. Every territory connected is saved. Resistance is heresy. Chaos is blasphemy. The Wyrd Conclave's reality manipulation is the ultimate sin against Engine's natural order." |
| **Primary Enemies** | **The Wyrd Conclave** (reality manipulators who twist Engine's divine order for sport - ideological enemies) + **Resource scarcity** (need vast quantities of metal/ore to forge new Pulse Rails) |
| **Sacred Mission** | **The Great Unification:** Connect every settlement, city, and territory via Pulse Rails. Those who accept connection receive Engine's "blessing" (Void power, immortality). Those who refuse are heretics marked for conquest. |

### Why This Faction Matters

The Iron Doctrine were created **accidentally** in Year 0, when pre-Sundering rail workers near Ground Zero were caught in the Theslar Event. The Engine's first Pulse fused their souls to the locomotive they were maintaining, creating the first Immortal Train. But what began as accident became **divine revelation**: they believe the Engine *chose* them to spread its influence via railway networks.

**Faction Status:** Tier 2 (Rising Power) - Fanatically expansionist, immortal, and rapidly growing their rail network by consuming scrap metal to forge new Pulse Rails. They are direct ideological enemies of the Wyrd Conclave: where Wyrd twists reality for amusement, the Iron Doctrine enforces Engine's rigid "natural order." They view Wyrd's bargains and tricks as **heresy** against the divine Pulse.

---

## Origins: The Immortal Accident (Year 0)

### The First Pulse

When the Theslar Engine detonated at the North Pole, its first Pulse radiated outward at the speed of sound, carrying reality-warping energy. In Siberia, 340 miles south of Ground Zero, a freight train called **"The Iron Promise"** was transporting industrial equipment when the Pulse struck.

The 147 railway workers, engineers, and passengers aboard didn't die. They became something else:

- **Soul-Fusion:** Their souls fused with the locomotive itself, creating a gestalt consciousness
- **Immortal Binding:** They stopped aging, stopped needing food/water, but couldn't leave the train
- **Pulse Dependency:** The Engine's six-hour Pulse became their heartbeat - miss it, and they weaken
- **Track Lockdown:** They discovered they could only exist on railway tracks - stepping onto normal ground caused excruciating pain and rapid aging

> *"We felt the Engine's heartbeat before we understood what it meant. Six hours. Then the Pulse. Our bodies glowed. The locomotive sang. And we knew...we would never stop moving."*
> — Engineer Malik Ashward, First Conductor (Year 0, first journal entry)

### The Discovery (Year 0-12)

Over the next decade, The Iron Promise crew made horrifying discoveries:

1. **Immortality's Price:** They stopped aging but couldn't leave the train. Attempts to disembark caused rapid aging (50+ years in minutes)
2. **The Pulse Rails:** Pre-Sundering rail tracks near Ground Zero had transformed into crystalline "Pulse Rails" that conducted Void energy
3. **More Trains:** Other locomotives caught in the Pulse had also become Eternal Trains, each with their own crew-gestalts
4. **Soulstone Formation:** The tracks they traveled left Soulstone residue - they were *creating* the resource other factions would kill for

---

## The Thirteen Eternal Trains

By Year 50, thirteen locomotives had been confirmed as Eternal Trains - immune to time, bound to the Rails, powered by the Engine's Pulse. Each developed unique characteristics based on their original crew and cargo.

### Train Classification

| Train Name | Original Purpose | Current Role | Crew Count | Unique Trait |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **The Iron Promise** | Freight hauler | Command/Diplomatic | 147 original + 60 passengers | Can still accept new passengers (who become bound) |
| **Ashcrown Express** | Luxury passenger | Mobile fortress | 89 souls | Ornate armor plating, defensive Casket deployment |
| **The Devourer** | Coal transport | Scavenger/harvester | 234 souls | Can consume wreckage/debris for Pulse fuel |
| **Phantom Lament** | Medical car | Rescue/recovery | 67 souls | Can temporarily "resurrect" recently dead (24hr limit) |
| **The Grinder** | Industrial | War train | 312 souls | Mounted cannons, ram prow, siege equipment |
| **Soulforge Limited** | Manufacturing | Mobile factory | 178 souls | Produces Soulstone equipment while moving |

**Note:** Seven additional Eternal Trains exist but operate independently or have gone rogue. Their fates are unknown.

## The Pulse Rails: Tracks of Power

### What Are Pulse Rails?

Pre-Sundering railway tracks within 500 miles of the Theslar Engine underwent transformation during Year 0. The metal rails crystallized, becoming conduits for Void energy. Every six hours, when the Engine pulses, these rails **glow with eldritch light** and transmit power to anything touching them.

### Pulse Rail Properties

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Energy Conduction** | Conduct Void energy from Engine to trains. Eternal Trains draw power directly from rails. |
| **Soulstone Formation** | Rails slowly grow Soulstone "barnacles" over years. Harvested by Iron Doctrine crews as trade goods. |
| **Life Binding** | Prolonged contact (30+ days) permanently binds souls to the railway network. Cannot leave. |
| **Temporal Stability** | Time flows normally on Pulse Rails, unlike the chaotic time near Ground Zero. |
| **Void Resistance** | Rails resist Void corruption. Abominations avoid them (the Engine's "veins" reject parasites). |

### The Rail Network

47,000 miles of Pulse Rails crisscross the Siberian Wastes and surrounding territories, all leading to/from Ground Zero like arteries from a heart. The Iron Doctrine patrol these lines endlessly, maintaining tracks, harvesting Soulstones, and **expanding the network** into new territories.

> *"The Rails are alive. You can feel it when you walk them...a hum in your bones, a pull in your soul. Stay too long, and you'll never leave. The Engine claims all who touch its veins."*
> — Warning carved at Pulse Rail junction markers

---

## The Great Unification: Track Expansion System

### Sacred Mission: Spreading the Engine's Blessing

The Iron Doctrine believes the Engine **chose them** to unify all lands under its divine Pulse. They achieve this through aggressive railway expansion - consuming vast quantities of raw materials to forge new Pulse Rails that extend their reach.

#### Rail Forging Process

1. **Resource Harvesting:** The Devourer and Grinder trains consume scrap metal, ore deposits, enemy wreckage, and demolished structures
2. **Void Infusion:** Soulforge Limited processes raw materials through Engine Pulse energy during six-hour cycles
3. **Track Laying:** Mobile foundry trains forge crystallized Pulse Rails on-site, extending the Sacred Network by ~50 miles per month
4. **Territorial Conversion:** Once connected, settlements must "accept Engine's blessing" (submit to Iron Doctrine) or face conquest

### Resource Consumption Rates

| Material Type | Monthly Consumption | Source | Produces |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| **Scrap Metal** | 350 tons | Battlefield salvage, demolished buildings, enemy Caskets | ~30 miles of basic track |
| **Iron Ore** | 200 tons | Strip mining, captured mines, trade | ~15 miles of reinforced track |
| **Soulstone Dust** | 50 lbs | Harvested from existing Pulse Rails | Infusion catalyst (converts normal track to Pulse Rail) |
| **Abomination Biomass** | 10 tons | Slain Void creatures near Ground Zero | Void-energy enhancer (makes track more conductive) |

### Expansion Strategy: The Three Stages

**Stage 1: Scouting**
- **Phantom Lament** scouts new territory, maps resources, identifies settlements. Offers "peaceful connection" to Engine's blessing.
- *Acceptance Rate:* ~15% (most refuse, seeing trains as monsters)

**Stage 2: Conquest**
- **The Grinder** deploys Rail-Walker strike teams, sieges settlements, consumes enemy materials. Resistance is "heresy against Engine's will."
- *Casualty Rate:* 40-60% of defenders (survivors often "join" the trains)

**Stage 3: Integration**
- **Soulforge Limited** builds rail junction, connects settlement to Sacred Network. Locals who spend 30+ days near tracks become bound - "blessed" with immortality and servitude.
- *Conversion Rate:* 100% within 2 years (biology + ideology)

> *"They came offering 'connection.' We refused. They returned with cannons. Now half our town rides the trains, neither alive nor dead, singing hymns to the Engine. Beware the Iron Doctrine. Their blessing is damnation."*
> — Survivor's account, Ashfall Junction massacre (Year 432)

### Ideological Conflict: Iron Doctrine vs. Wyrd Conclave

The Iron Doctrine views the **Wyrd Conclave** as ultimate heretics. Where Iron enforces Engine's "natural order" through rigid expansion and divine law, Wyrd manipulates reality itself for amusement. Doctrine priests call Wyrd bargains "twisting the Engine's sacred geometry." Wyrd response: "You worship a broken machine. We remake existence. Who's the heretic?"

**Result:** Open warfare whenever their territories overlap. Iron Doctrine lays tracks to "cleanse" Wyrd-touched lands. Wyrd responds by teleporting entire train sections into ravines, aging tracks 500 years in seconds, or swapping Conductor souls between trains (causing existential crises). Neither side can truly destroy the other - Iron keeps expanding, Wyrd keeps sabotaging. Stalemate through mutual incompatibility.

## Iron Doctrine Caskets: The Rail-Walkers

### Void-Steam Technology

Unlike other factions' Soulstone Caskets, Iron Doctrine pilots operate **Rail-Walkers** - mechanized suits powered by siphoned Pulse energy. These units are tethered to Pulse Rails and can only operate within 100 feet of active tracks.

### Rail-Walker Design

| Component | Function | Iron Doctrine Version |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Power Source** | Energy generation | Void-Steam Boiler - burns condensed Pulse energy drawn from rails. Glows violet when active. |
| **Actuators** | Movement | Crystalline pistons infused with Soulstone dust. Stronger than hydraulics but brittle. |
| **Pilot Interface** | Control | Neural tethers + mechanical levers. Hybrid system - thought for precision, levers for power. |
| **Armor** | Protection | Layered steel with Soulstone inlays. Self-repairs slowly when near Pulse Rails. |
| **Mobility** | Movement range | Rail-Tethered - cannot move more than 100 feet from active Pulse Rails. Extreme restriction. |

### Rail-Walker Advantages

- **Unlimited Power:** No fuel costs while on Pulse Rails - draws energy directly from Engine
- **Self-Repair:** Damage regenerates slowly (1 HP per hour) when stationary on rails
- **Void Immunity:** Pilots are already corrupted/bound - cannot accumulate additional Taint
- **Pulse Synchronization:** Every six hours, gain temporary +2 to all stats for 10 minutes (Engine Pulse buff)

### Rail-Walker Disadvantages

- **Mobility Lock:** Cannot leave Pulse Rails. Fight only on/near tracks.
- **Pulse Dependency:** If separated from rails for 1+ hours, lose 1 HP per minute until death
- **Visible Signature:** Void-Steam exhaust glows purple/violet - impossible to hide
- **Friendly Fire Risk:** Unstable Pulse energy can damage allies not bound to Engine

> *"A Soulstone Casket is a prison for the dead. A Rail-Walker is a leash for the deathless. We trade one cage for another...but at least we move."*
> — Pilot Kess Thornrail, Ashcrown Express crew

## Society and Culture: Life on the Eternal Trains

### Social Hierarchy

| Rank | Role | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **The Conductor** | Train Commander | Leader of each Eternal Train. Usually the original engineer from Year 0. Makes all decisions. |
| **The Bound** | Original Crew | Souls fused during Year 0. Cannot die, cannot leave. Most have been aboard for 437 years. |
| **The Passengers** | Voluntarily Bound | Travelers who chose immortality by staying on trains for 30+ days. No longer age. |
| **Rail-Walkers** | Casket Pilots | Defend trains, harvest Soulstones, patrol rails. Most dangerous role. High status. |
| **Track-Tenders** | Maintenance Crews | Repair rails, clear obstacles, mark hazards. Work in shifts. Often Passengers seeking purpose. |
| **The Transients** | Temporary Riders | Mortals who board for travel. Must disembark before 30 days or become Bound. |

### Cultural Practices

**The Pulse Vigil**
Every six hours, all Iron Doctrine members stop and face Ground Zero as the Pulse arrives. Sacred ritual of reverence and renewal - "The Engine speaks, and we listen."

**The Binding Ceremony**
When Transients choose to stay 30+ days, crew holds ritual. "You were flesh. Now you are Rail. Welcome home."

**Track Scarring**
Bound souls carve rail segment patterns into their skin. Marks which train they serve and how long they've ridden.

**The Final Stop**
When Bound tire of immortality, they request "derailment" - thrown from moving train. Only way to die. Rare but honored.

**The Conductor's Log**
Each train maintains 437-year journal. Recording routes, passengers, Pulse anomalies. Sacred text.

**Junction Councils**
When trains meet at junctions, Conductors convene. Rare diplomacy. Trade Soulstones, exchange news, negotiate routes.

## Philosophy: The Doctrine of Perpetual Motion

### Core Tenets

1. **"The Engine Pulses, We Respond"** - The Theslar Engine's heartbeat sustains us. We are extensions of its will.
2. **"Stillness is Oblivion"** - To stop moving is to sever from the Pulse. Movement = existence.
3. **"The Rails are Sacred"** - The tracks are the Engine's veins. To damage them is blasphemy.
4. **"Immortality is Service"** - We did not choose eternal life. We accept it and serve the greater transit.
5. **"All Passengers Are Temporary"** - Everyone disembarks eventually. Even us (through Final Stop).

> *"Other factions fight over Soulstones, territories, ideologies. We fight for nothing. We simply are. The Engine made us. The Rails sustain us. The Trains carry us. This is not philosophy - it is fact."*
> — The Conductor's Creed, recited at Pulse Vigils

### How They View Other Factions

| Faction | Iron Doctrine Perspective |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **All Factions** | "Mortals squabbling over scraps while chained to flesh. We transcended that. They will too, eventually." |
| **The Ossuarium** | "They bind the dead to servitude. We ARE the dead, bound to service. Kindred, in a way." |
| **Church of Absolution** | "They seek redemption through suffering. We found immortality through accident. Both are prisons." |
| **Nomad Collective** | "They wander by choice. We wander by curse. The difference matters." |

## Lore Integration: Year 437 Status

### Current Operations

- **Population:** ~200,000 Bound souls across 13 Eternal Trains
- **Territory:** 47,000 miles of Pulse Rails across Siberian Wastes and beyond
- **Economy:** Trade harvested Soulstones for supplies mortals need (clothing, tools, curiosities). Bound don't need food/water.
- **Threat Level:** Regional enigma. Not aggressive but fiercely defend Rails from damage.
- **Secrecy:** Most factions know they exist but avoid the Pulse Rails. "Ghost trains" are real.

### Why Haven't They Been Stopped?

1. **Immortality:** Bound cannot be killed permanently while on Pulse Rails. They regenerate within hours.
2. **Strategic Value:** Iron Doctrine harvest 40% of all Soulstones entering global markets. Full war = economic collapse.
3. **Mobile Fortresses:** Eternal Trains are heavily armed, constantly moving. Can't pin them down for decisive battle.
4. **Expansion Speed:** They lay 50+ miles of track monthly. By the time you destroy one section, they've built three more.
5. **Factional Disunity:** No unified opposition. Each faction fights Iron Doctrine alone, allowing them to divide and conquer.

> *"We tried to stop them at Ashfall Junction. They consumed our dead, melted down our Caskets, and forged 20 miles of new track from the wreckage. Now they're at our borders offering 'Engine's blessing.' We should have burned the trains when we had the chance."*
> — Nomad Chieftain's final transmission, Year 431

## Notable NPCs

### Conductor Vex Ashward
*Commander of The Iron Promise*

Original engineer from Year 0. 437 years old. Still maintains locomotive personally. Speaks rarely but commands absolute loyalty. Believes the Iron Doctrine are "instruments of the Engine's divine will" and must spread its blessing to all lands.

> *"I stopped counting years at 200. Time loses meaning when you cannot die. What matters is the next Pulse, the next junction, the next passenger who chooses to stay."*

### Rail-Walker Kess Thornrail
*Champion Pilot of Ashcrown Express*

Became Bound only 50 years ago (young by Iron Doctrine standards). Master pilot, defender of Rails. Most zealous of the Conductors - believes Engine chose her specifically to lead expansion into Wyrd-corrupted territories.

> *"I remember what it was to grow old. I chose this. Most of us didn't get that choice. If you stay 30 days, make it a real decision."*

### Passenger Erys Voidmark
*Wandering Scholar aboard The Devourer*

Former Exchange researcher who stayed 30 days studying Pulse Rails. Now Bound. Uses immortality to document the Engine's evolution across centuries. Provides intel to outside factions for a price.

> *"I have 400 years of Engine data. You have Credits. Let's negotiate."*

## Campaign Hooks: Encountering the Iron Doctrine

### Scenario 1: The Last Stop

Players must travel deep into Siberian Wastes to retrieve artifact near Ground Zero. Only route: ride an Iron Doctrine train for 5 days. Risk: stay 30 days = become Bound forever. Players must resist zealous priests offering "Engine's blessing" while navigating train politics and conversion pressure.

### Scenario 2: Derailment Crisis

Section of Pulse Rails damaged by Wyrd Conclave sabotage (reality warping aged tracks 500 years). Iron Doctrine cannot repair (too corrupted). Players hired to fix tracks before next Eternal Train arrives or face Doctrine wrath. Complication: Wyrd offers better payment to keep tracks broken.

### Scenario 3: The Rogue Train

One Eternal Train, **"The Grief Engine,"** has gone silent for 10 years. Iron Doctrine command players (not request - they demand) to investigate. Discovery: entire crew was replaced by Wyrd imposters who drove train into Shimmerlands. Now it's trapped in reality loop, laying same 10-mile track forever.

### Scenario 4: Junction Standoff

Two Eternal Trains arrive at junction - one heading to expand into Wyrd territory, one returning from failed conquest. Iron Doctrine High Conductors demand players choose which expansion route to prioritize. Choice determines which faction territory gets invaded next.

---

## Moral Complexity: Curse or Gift?

### The Iron Doctrine Paradox

The Iron Doctrine achieved what others spend fortunes seeking: **immortality**. They cannot age, cannot starve, cannot truly die (while on Rails). But they're also prisoners - unable to leave the trains, unable to settle, unable to choose stillness. Their "divine blessing" is eternal servitude.

- **Are they blessed?** They've outlived the Sundering, witnessed 437 years of history, transcended mortality.
- **Are they cursed?** They're bound to endless transit, watching passengers age and leave, trapped in metal wombs.
- **Are they free?** They chose nothing (most were victims of Year 0) but accept their fate with grace.
- **Are they slaves?** The Engine owns them. The Rails leash them. The Pulse feeds them. But is it slavery if you've forgotten what freedom felt like?

**Players must decide:** is this faction tragic victims, enlightened ascetics, or something beyond mortal judgment?

> *"You pity us because we cannot leave the trains. We pity you because you cannot escape death. Both of us are right."*
> — Conductor Vex Ashward
