# The Concordat of Coins - Year 73 Treaty

**Date Signed**: Year 73, Third Month, Day 12  
**Location**: Ashveil Clearinghouse (neutral territory)  
**Signatories**: 9 factions + Ledger Orthodox + Rational House

---

## Pre-Treaty Chaos (Year 0-73)

### Economic Collapse

**Immediate Post-Sundering (Year 0-10)**:
- Pre-Sundering currency worthless (paper money from dead nations)
- Barter economy dominant (trade goods for goods, inefficient)
- Soulstones discovered as Void-resistant resource (Year 3)
- Church monopolizes Soulstone production (claims divine mandate)

**Currency Wars (Year 10-50)**:
- Multiple factions print own currency (Credits, Shards, Scrip, etc.)
- No universal standard (1 Church Credit ≠ 1 Dwarven Shard)
- Hyperinflation (some factions print unlimited money, value collapses)
- Trade impossible (no one trusts foreign currency)

**The Breaking Point (Year 50-73)**:
- **Void Incursions increasing** (Abomination attacks every few months)
- **Factions can't coordinate defense** (no economic cooperation)
- **Example failure (Year 68)**: Church offered to pay Dwarves to defend border
  - Church offered 10,000 Credits
  - Dwarves demanded payment in Soulstones (didn't trust Credits)
  - Church refused (Soulstones sacred, not for mercenaries)
  - **Result**: Border undefended, 500 civilians killed by Abominations

**Crisis Realization (Year 72)**:
- All factions simultaneously realized: **"We need unified currency or we all die."**

## The Negotiations (Year 73, First-Third Month)

### First Month: The Gathering

**Attendees**:
1. Church of Absolution (Grand Inquisitor Aldric)
2. Dwarven Forge-Guilds (Forgemaster Durak)
3. Verdant Covenant (Rootwarden Sylra)
4. The Ossuarium (Bonelord Thresh)
5. Nomad Collective (Warlord Kess)
6. Merchant Guilds (Proctor Vaelan)
7. Ledger Orthodox (Brother Matthias "The First Accountant")
8. Rational House (Director Eliana Voss, Ilyara's grandmother)
9. Wyrd Conclave (Mockingbird, representing Fae interests)

**Initial Positions**:
- **Church**: "Soulstones are divine. We control them. Accept Church Credits or starve."
- **Dwarves**: "We have Soulstone mines too. We print our own currency. Church has no monopoly."
- **Ossuarium**: "Currency is irrelevant. We trade in souls."
- **Nomads**: "We'll accept anything shiny. Just stop the hyperinflation."
- **Ledger Orthodox**: "God wills unified currency. We offer blessing."
- **Rational House**: "Markets will self-regulate. Remove Church monopoly."
- **Wyrd Conclave**: "We'll accept any currency... in exchange for your firstborn." (Mockingbird trolling)

**Result of First Month**: Complete deadlock. Everyone wants control, no one willing to compromise.

---

### Second Month: The Breakthrough

**Day 15**: Brother Matthias (Ledger Orthodox) proposes compromise:
> "The Church has moral authority. The merchants have infrastructure. Unite them. Let God bless the coins, let merchants distribute them."

**Church's Objection**: "We won't partner with heretics."

**Rational House Counter-Offer**: "Then let the economy collapse. Your worshippers will starve. Good luck maintaining moral authority when you have no followers."

**Day 28**: Grand Inquisitor Aldric (Church) agrees to compromise:
> "Fine. Let the Ledger Orthodox represent faith. They're... acceptable. But we control Soulstone mining."

**Day 30**: Dwarves agree:
> "We'll sell Soulstones to this 'Exchange' at fair market price. But if you cheat us, we'll flood the market with counterfeit Credits."

---

### Third Month: The Treaty

**Day 12**: The Concordat of Coins signed.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Unified Currency**: Soulstone-backed Credits (1 Credit = 0.1 grams Soulstone dust)
2. **Monopoly Granted**: Only The Soulstone Exchange can issue Credits (all other currencies illegal)
3. **Dual Governance**: Ledger Orthodox (moral oversight) + Rational House (operations)
4. **Neutrality Clause**: Exchange must trade with all factions, even enemies (can't refuse service)
5. **Sanctification Requirement**: All Soulstones must be blessed by Orthodox priests (Church approves)
6. **Usury Cap**: Maximum 20% interest (Orthodox enforcement)
7. **Contract Enforcement**: Exchange has authority to hunt contract breakers (legal mercenary force)
8. **Profit Distribution**: 50/50 split between Orthodox and Rational House (prevents infighting)
9. **Treaty Duration**: 367 years (until Year 440) (arbitrary mystical number, Orthodox insisted)

**Signatures**:
- Brother Matthias (Ledger Orthodox, primary negotiator)
- Director Eliana Voss (Rational House, primary negotiator)
- Grand Inquisitor Aldric (Church of Absolution, approving Soulstone sanctification)
- Forgemaster Durak (Dwarves, agreeing to sell Soulstones)
- 5 other faction representatives (witness signatures)

## Immediate Impact (Year 73-100)

### Year 73-75: Implementation

**First Exchange Clearinghouse** (Ashveil Clearinghouse):
- Built in neutral territory (ruins of pre-Sundering city)
- Staffed by 50 Orthodox priests + 50 Rational House bankers
- **First transaction (Year 73, Day 100)**: Dwarves sell 1000 Soulstones to Exchange for 10,000 Credits
- **First sanctification (Year 73, Day 101)**: Orthodox priests bless Soulstones, issue Credits

**First Year Results**:
- 100,000 Credits issued
- 7 factions adopt Credits as primary currency
- Hyperinflation stops (unified standard)
- Trade increases 300% (factions can trust currency)

---

### Year 75-100: Expansion

**By Year 100**:
- 50 Exchange branches across all territories
- 10,000,000 Credits in circulation
- Orthodox priests: 200 (blessing Soulstones full-time)
- Rational House bankers: 500 (managing operations)
- **Exchange net profit**: 500,000 Credits/year (250,000 Orthodox, 250,000 Rational)

**Success Metrics**:
- Void defense coordination improved (factions can pay mercenaries in trusted currency)
- Trade routes established (caravans accept Credits universally)
- Contract enforcement effective (only 3 contract breakers Year 75-100, all hunted down)

---

## Long-Term Consequences (Year 100-437)

### Economic Domination

**By Year 437**:
- Exchange has **absolute monopoly** on currency issuance
- **95% of all transactions** use Credits (other currencies extinct)
- Exchange branches in every major settlement (ubiquitous)
- **Exchange wealth**: 50,000,000 Credits in reserve (richest organization post-Sundering)

**Power**:
- Exchange can destroy factions economically (refuse to issue Credits = economic collapse)
- Exchange can manipulate markets (control interest rates, exchange rates)
- Exchange is **untouchable** (no faction dares challenge monopoly, too economically dependent)

---

### Factional Dependence

**All factions rely on Exchange**:
- **Church**: Needs Credits to pay for crusades (mercenary soldiers expensive)
- **Dwarves**: Sells Soulstones to Exchange (primary income source)
- **Nomads**: Entire economy is Credits (no alternative currency)
- **Ossuarium**: Even undead use Credits (pay for Casket parts, necromantic materials)

**Result**: Exchange has de facto control over all factions (economic leverage > military power).

---

### Internal Tensions

**Year 200-437: Orthodox vs. Rational Power Struggle**:
- Orthodox: Moral authority declining (younger generations secular)
- Rational: Economic power increasing (profits > faith)
- **Flashpoints**:
  - Year 250: Orthodox try to ban mercenary contracts (Rational refuse, deadlock)
  - Year 300: Rational propose removing sanctification (Orthodox threaten to quit, deadlock)
  - Year 350: Orthodox reduce usury cap to 15% (Rational furious, comply reluctantly)
  - Year 400: Rational gain majority on Board (6/10 votes, Orthodox losing control)

**Current State (Year 437)**:
- Rational House dominant (Director Voss controls day-to-day operations)
- Orthodox declining (Brother Balthus fighting to maintain relevance)
- **Treaty expiration looming (Year 440)**: Renegotiation will determine future

---

## Year 440: Treaty Expiration

### The Renegotiation

**Year 440, Third Month**: Original Concordat expires (367-year term ends)

**Orthodox Demands**:
1. Increase sanctification requirements (slow currency issuance, maintain Orthodox leverage)
2. Reduce usury cap to 10% (more merciful lending)
3. Ban mercenary contracts (too sinful)
4. Increase Orthodox Board seats (6/10 instead of 5/10)

**Rational House Counter-Demands**:
1. Remove sanctification requirement (speed currency issuance)
2. Remove usury cap (allow free-market interest rates)
3. Full legalization of mercenary contracts (no moral oversight)
4. Reduce Orthodox Board seats (3/10 instead of 5/10)

**Predictions**:
- **Deadlock likely** (neither side willing to compromise)
- **Possible outcomes**:
  - **Compromise**: Treaty renewed with minor adjustments (status quo continues)
  - **Schism**: Exchange splits into Orthodox Credits vs. Rational Credits (economic chaos)
  - **Takeover**: One side forces other out (winner takes full control)

---

## Player Campaign Integration

### Early Campaign (Year 437-438)

**Quest**: "The First Exchange"
- Players need Credits for equipment/supplies
- Visit Exchange branch, meet Orthodox and Rational representatives
- Learn about factional split (Orthodox priest blessing Soulstones, Rational banker rolling eyes)

---

### Mid Campaign (Year 438-439)

**Quest**: "Contract Enforcement"
- Exchange hires players to hunt contract breaker
- Orthodox representative wants mercy (capture alive)
- Rational representative wants death (send message)
- **Choice**: Mercy (Orthodox favor) OR execution (Rational favor)

---

### Late Campaign (Year 440)

**Quest**: "The Concordat's End"
- Treaty expiration imminent
- Orthodox and Rational deadlocked in negotiation
- **Player role**: Mediate compromise OR pick a side
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Mediation success**: Treaty renewed, Exchange survives united
  - **Orthodox victory**: Moral authority restored, usury cap enforced, mercenary contracts banned
  - **Rational victory**: Sanctification removed, free-market economics, Orthodox relegated to ceremonial role
  - **Schism**: Exchange splits, economic chaos, two competing currencies

---

## The Great Ledger (Orthodox Holy Text)

### What Is It?

**Orthodox Belief**:
- Divine book written by God (not physical, metaphysical)
- Records all transactions, debts, contracts across all time
- Every Credit spent = entry in Ledger
- At death, souls judged by Ledger balance (debts unpaid = damnation)

**Rational House View**:
- Metaphor (not literal book)
- Useful fiction (keeps borrowers honest, fear of divine punishment)
- No evidence of existence (no one's ever seen it)

---

### Ledger Mechanics (Orthodox Rituals)

**Balance Day** (annual Orthodox holiday):
- Orthodox priests "audit" The Great Ledger (ritual, not literal)
- Publicly announce total Credits in circulation
- Forgive smallest debts (bottom 10% of debtors pardoned)
- **Purpose**: Maintain moral legitimacy, show mercy

**Ledger Sight** (Orthodox rare ability):
- Some Orthodox priests claim to "see" The Great Ledger
- Can allegedly recall any transaction ever made
- **Skeptics** (Rational House): "Photographic memory, not divine vision"
- **Believers** (Orthodox): "Gift from God, prove faith"

**Brother Balthus claims Ledger Sight** (unverified, but his memory is eerily perfect).

---

## Economic Vocabulary (Post-Concordat)

**Terms Invented by Exchange**:

- **Credit**: Unit of currency (1 Credit = 0.1g Soulstone dust)
- **Sanctification**: Blessing of Soulstones by Orthodox priests
- **Clearinghouse**: Exchange branch (place to clear debts/credits)
- **Contract Enforcement**: Hunting/killing contract breakers
- **Usury**: Excessive interest (Orthodox definition: >20%)
- **Ledger Balance**: Total debts vs. credits (financial health)
- **The Great Ledger**: Divine record of all transactions (Orthodox theology)

---

## Legacy of the Concordat

**What Year 73 Changed**:
1. **Unified economy**: All factions can trade (no more currency wars)
2. **Coordinated defense**: Factions can pay mercenaries in trusted currency (Void defenses improved)
3. **Economic peace**: No faction wars over money (too economically interdependent)
4. **Exchange dominance**: Created most powerful post-Sundering institution (rivals Church in influence)

**What Didn't Change**:
1. **Factional hatred**: Factions still distrust each other (economics ≠ friendship)
2. **War**: Factions still fight (but pay for wars in Credits instead of barter)
3. **Poverty**: Unified currency didn't end inequality (rich still rich, poor still poor)

**Quote from Brother Matthias (Year 73)**:
> "The Concordat won't save us. It will only postpone our collapse. But postponement is all we have."
