## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Faction Units + 2 Neutral?
Exchange doctrine is "buy what you need." They have:
- **3 Core Units**: Professional enforcers, debt collectors, mercenaries
- **2 Neutral Units**: Available to all factions, but Exchange gets 25% discount

### Faction Advantage
Exchange can hire Neutral Mercenaries cheaper than other factions:
- **Freelance Blade**: 37 Credits (vs 50 for others)
- **Siege Breaker Crew**: 56 Credits (vs 75 for others)

This reflects their economic dominance and mercenary connections.
