# Soulstone Exchange - Support Units
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Version**: 2.0 Equipment System
**Status**: üöß **DESIGN IN PROGRESS** - Framework Complete
**Date**: October 17, 2025

The Soulstone Exchange fields hired mercenaries, security contractors, and corporate enforcers. Unlike other factions' support units, Exchange units must be **purchased with Credits**.

## EXCHANGE SUPPORT UNITS OVERVIEW

**Mercenary Units** (Hire with Credits during battle):
1. Security Contractor (2 Credits) - Defensive infantry
2. Corporate Enforcer (3 Credits) - Offensive assault unit
3. Debt Collector (2 Credits) - Economic warfare specialist

**Premium Units** (Require Credits + Campaign unlock):
4. Executive Bodyguard (4 Credits) - Elite protection
5. Hostile Takeover Squad (5 Credits) - Objective capture team
6. Board of Directors (8 Credits) - Ultimate power unit

**Unique Mechanic**: Exchange units are **not pre-deployed**. You hire them mid-battle using Credit tokens generated by your deck.

**Design Philosophy**: Pay-to-win corporate warfare. Strong units, but you must generate economy to afford them. Risk vs reward: spend Credits on units OR on powerful financial cards.

## FACTION SYNERGIES

| Mechanic | Synergy |
|----------|---------|
| **Credit Economy** | Debt Collectors generate Credits ‚Üí fund Corporate Enforcers ‚Üí pressure enemy |
| **Defensive Stance** | Security Contractor holds while you generate Credits safely |
| **Hostile Acquisition** | Board steals enemy support units (use their strength against them) |
| **Golden Parachute** | Board refunds 5 Credits on death (not a total loss) |
| **Liquidate** | Debt Collector can be sacrificed for emergency Credits |

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Core Fantasy**: "Money buys victory." You're not a military faction‚Äîyou're a corporation hiring the best fighters money can buy.

**Balance Consideration**: Exchange units are STRONG, but temporary and expensive. Counterplay is to pressure Exchange economy (kill Debt Collectors, force Credit expenditure on defense).

**Next Steps**:
1. Develop full behavior decks (6 cards per unit)
2. Playtest Credit economy (ensure hiring costs are balanced)
3. Test Board of Directors power level (8 Credits should feel worth it)

---

**"In the Exchange, loyalty is measured in Credits. And Credits can buy anything."**
