## FACTION SYNERGIES

| Mechanic | Synergy |
|----------|---------|
| **Credit Economy** | Debt Collectors generate Credits → fund Corporate Enforcers → pressure enemy |
| **Defensive Stance** | Security Contractor holds while you generate Credits safely |
| **Hostile Acquisition** | Board steals enemy support units (use their strength against them) |
| **Golden Parachute** | Board refunds 5 Credits on death (not a total loss) |
| **Liquidate** | Debt Collector can be sacrificed for emergency Credits |

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Core Fantasy**: "Money buys victory." You're not a military faction—you're a corporation hiring the best fighters money can buy.

**Balance Consideration**: Exchange units are STRONG, but temporary and expensive. Counterplay is to pressure Exchange economy (kill Debt Collectors, force Credit expenditure on defense).

**Behavior Deck Design Philosophy**:
- **Security Contractor**: Defensive AI prioritizes protecting assets and holding positions
- **Corporate Enforcer**: Aggressive AI targets high-value enemies and executes weakened targets
- **Debt Collector**: Economic AI generates Credits through harassment and opportunistic strikes
- **Executive Bodyguard**: Protective AI stays near Casket, intercepts threats, counters attacks
- **Hostile Takeover Squad**: Objective-focused AI captures and holds objectives with Zone Control
- **Board of Directors**: Command AI stays at safe distance while buffing all friendly units

**"In the Exchange, loyalty is measured in Credits. And Credits can buy anything."**
