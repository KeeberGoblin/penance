## Credit Token Mechanics

### What Are Credits?

**In-Universe**:
- Soulstone-backed currency (physical coins infused with Soulstone dust)
- Universally accepted (all factions recognize Exchange Credits)
- Non-degradable (unlike paper currency, Soulstones don't decay)
- Traceable (Exchange records all transactions in The Great Ledger)

**In-Game**:
- Separate resource from SP (Soul Points)
- Persist across turns (don't refresh like SP)
- Can be stockpiled indefinitely (no maximum)
- Shared resource (if playing team Exchange, Credits are individual, not pooled)

## Generating Credits

### Primary Generation: War Profiteer (Passive)

**Effect**: When ANY Casket (enemy, ally, or neutral) is destroyed within 6 hexes of you, gain 2 Credit tokens. **Bonus:** Gain 3 Credits if you dealt the killing blow.

**Why This Is Core**:
- Scales with battlefield activity (more deaths = more Credits)
- Rewards kills but doesn't require them (allies killing enemies still generates Credits)
- Snowball mechanic (Credits → Mercenaries → more kills → more Credits)

**Optimal Play**:
- Position within 6 hexes of combat (maximize kill coverage)
- Don't tunnel vision on your kills (allies killing = free Credits)
- Use Mercenaries to farm kills (they generate Credits for you even when you're not attacking)

---

### Secondary Generation: Kill Cards

#### Hostile Takeover (4 SP, Melee, 6 damage)
- **Effect**: If this kills the target, gain 4 Credit tokens and recover 2 cards
- **Best used when**: Target has 6 or fewer HP (guaranteed kill)
- **Value**: 4 Credits + 2 cards = 6 value for 4 SP

#### Buyout Strike (Primary Weapon, 4 SP, Melee, 6 damage)
- **Effect**: If this kills the target, immediately summon 1 Mercenary (no Credit cost)
- **Best used when**: Target has 6 or fewer HP, you need a Mercenary
- **Value**: Free 3-Credit Mercenary = kill pays for itself

---

### Tertiary Generation: Financial Cards

#### War Bonds (1 SP)
- **Effect**: Gain 3 Credit tokens immediately. Generate 1 Heat.
- **Best used when**: Need Credits fast (early game acceleration)
- **Risk**: Generates Heat (don't spam, manage Heat carefully)
- **Value**: 3 Credits for 1 SP + 1 Heat = emergency cash injection

#### Liquidate Assets (0 SP, Gambit)
- **Effect**: Destroy all your active Mercenaries. Gain 2 Credit tokens per Mercenary destroyed.
- **Best used when**: Mercenaries are damaged and about to die (convert dying assets into Credits)
- **Risk**: Lose board presence (no more Mercenaries until you re-summon)
- **Value**: 2 damaged Mercenaries = 4 Credits (saves them from wasted deaths)

## Credit Generation Rate (Expected)

### Solo Exchange Pilot (No Allies)

**Early Game (Turns 1-3)**:
- War Profiteer: 0-2 kills = 0-6 Credits
- War Bonds: +3 Credits (if used)
- **Total**: 3-9 Credits by Turn 3

**Mid Game (Turns 4-6)**:
- War Profiteer: 2-4 kills = 6-12 Credits
- Hostile Takeover: +4 Credits (1 use)
- Mercenaries farming: +4-6 Credits (Mercenaries get kills)
- **Total**: 14-22 Credits by Turn 6

**Late Game (Turns 7+)**:
- War Profiteer: 4-6 kills = 12-18 Credits
- Multiple kill cards: +8-12 Credits
- Mercenary farming: +8-12 Credits
- **Total**: 28-42 Credits by Turn 10

---

### Team Exchange (4 Players, All Exchange)

**Early Game (Turns 1-3)**:
- War Profiteer triggers for ALL nearby kills (each player gets Credits)
- Team total: 12-24 Credits (4 players × 3-6 Credits)

**Mid Game (Turns 4-6)**:
- Exponential scaling (Mercenaries from all players farming kills)
- Team total: 40-80 Credits

**Late Game (Turns 7+)**:
- Credit saturation (everyone has 10+ Credits)
- Team total: 100+ Credits (unlimited resources)

## Spending Credits

### Credit Cost Reference Table

| Action | Cost | Value | Best Used When |
|--------|------|-------|----------------|
| **Hire Mercenary** | 3 | 8 HP, 3 damage unit | Need board presence |
| **Insurance Policy** | 3 | Negate 1 attack | Facing lethal damage |
| **Market Manipulation** | 2 | Enemies +1 SP cost | Enemies low on SP |
| **Golden Parachute** | 5 | Resurrect (once/mission) | At 5 cards or fewer |
| **Debt Forgiveness** | 5 | Negate + heal 5 (once/mission) | Emergency survival |
| **Premium Ammunition** | 3 | +2 damage, ignore Defense | Need burst damage |
| **Executive Privilege** | 4 | All cards -1 SP cost | Have strong hand |
| **Auction Bid** | X | Draw X cards (max 5) | Need card advantage |

---

## Credit Spending Priority

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
**Goal**: Build board presence

**Priority 1**: Hire Mercenary (3 Credits)
- Reason: Mercenaries farm kills → generate more Credits → snowball

**Priority 2**: War Bonds (if no Credits)
- Reason: Need Credits to summon first Mercenary

**Don't Spend On**:
- Defenses (low threat early game)
- Premium Ammunition (no targets yet)

---

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
**Goal**: Maximize pressure and farm Credits

**Priority 1**: Hire 2nd Mercenary (3 Credits)
- Reason: Maximum Mercenary count = 2, need both active

**Priority 2**: Contract Enforcement (2 SP, buff Mercenaries)
- Reason: +2 damage/Defense makes Mercenaries lethal and survivable

**Priority 3**: Insurance Policy (3 Credits, defensive)
- Reason: Enemies starting to threaten, need defense

**Don't Spend On**:
- Golden Parachute (save for late game)
- Auction Bid (card advantage not critical yet)

---

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
**Goal**: Close out game or survive to late

**Priority 1**: Golden Parachute (5 Credits, once per mission)
- Reason: Resurrect safety net for final push

**Priority 2**: Premium Ammunition (3 Credits)
- Reason: +2 damage ignore Defense = finish wounded enemies

**Priority 3**: Debt Forgiveness (5 Credits, once per mission)
- Reason: Emergency heal if Golden Parachute already used

**Spending Freedom**: By late game, should have 15+ Credits (can afford everything)

---

## Credit Banking Strategy

### Optimal Bank Amount

**Early Game**: Bank 3-6 Credits
- Need 3 for Mercenary summon
- Extra 3 for Insurance Policy (emergency defense)

**Mid Game**: Bank 6-9 Credits
- Need 6 for 2 Mercenaries
- Extra 3 for Insurance Policy

**Late Game**: Bank 10+ Credits
- Need 5 for Golden Parachute (resurrection)
- Extra 5 for Debt Forgiveness (backup heal)

### Never Go Below 3 Credits

**Why**: Insurance Policy costs 3 Credits (negate 1 attack)
- If you have 0-2 Credits, you're defenseless
- Always keep 3 Credits in reserve for emergency negation

**Exception**: All-in aggression (spend everything for final kill, accept risk)

## Credit Mistakes to Avoid

### X Don't Hoard Credits Early

**Problem**: Credits don't generate value sitting unused
**Solution**: Spend 3 Credits on first Mercenary by Turn 2-3 (start farming kills)

### X Don't Summon Mercenaries Without War Profiteer

**Problem**: Mercenaries cost 3 Credits but can't generate Credits back if you don't have War Profiteer active
**Solution**: Always include War Profiteer in deck if running Mercenaries

### X Don't Spend Credits on Auction Bid Early

**Problem**: Card advantage doesn't matter if you have no board presence
**Solution**: Summon Mercenaries first (pressure > card advantage early)

### X Don't Use Golden Parachute Too Early

**Problem**: Once per mission, wasted if used at 5 cards when you could have survived naturally
**Solution**: Save for critical moment (final boss phase, desperate situation, guaranteed death)

### X Don't Forget Credit Generation Range

**Problem**: War Profiteer only triggers within 6 hexes (if you're too far, no Credits)
**Solution**: Position aggressively (stay within 6 hexes of combat)

## Advanced Credit Tactics

### Tactic 1: Mercenary Farming Loop

**Setup**: 2 active Mercenaries + War Profiteer

**Execution**:
1. Mercenaries attack and kill enemies (you're within 6 hexes)
2. War Profiteer triggers (gain 2 Credits per kill)
3. Use Credits to re-summon Mercenaries if they die
4. **Result**: Self-sustaining Mercenary army (kills pay for replacements)

**Value**: Infinite pressure (Mercenaries never run out)

---

### Tactic 2: Credit Burst Combo

**Setup**: Hostile Takeover + Buyout Strike + War Profiteer

**Execution**:
1. Use Hostile Takeover (6 damage, 4 Credits on kill)
2. Use Buyout Strike (6 damage, free Mercenary on kill)
3. War Profiteer triggers (2-3 Credits per kill)
4. **Result**: 2 kills = 6-7 Credits + 1 free Mercenary

**Value**: 9-10 Credits worth of value from 2 kills

---

### Tactic 3: Defensive Credit Conversion

**Setup**: Low HP, high Credits, Insurance Policy + Golden Parachute

**Execution**:
1. Tank with Insurance Policy (3 Credits, negate attacks)
2. If deck reaches 5 cards, use Golden Parachute (5 Credits, resurrect)
3. **Result**: Convert 8 Credits into survival (instead of dying with Credits in bank)

**Value**: Credits worthless if dead (spend them to survive)

---

### Tactic 4: Economic Warfare

**Setup**: Market Manipulation + Economic Leverage + Bribe

**Execution**:
1. Market Manipulation (2 Credits, enemies +1 SP cost)
2. Bribe (2 SP, enemy -2 to hit, -1 movement)
3. Economic Leverage (2 SP, enemy takes 4 damage OR skips turn)
4. **Result**: Enemy crippled (can't attack effectively, can't move, must skip turn or die)

**Value**: 2 Credits + 4 SP = lockdown enemy for 1-2 turns

## Credit Economy FAQs

**Q: Do Credits carry over between missions?**  
A: No. Spend all Credits before mission ends.

**Q: Can allies steal my Credits?**  
A: No. Credits are individual resource, not pooled.

**Q: Can I trade Credits with allies?**  
A: No. No trading mechanic (would break economy balance).

**Q: What happens if I have 10+ Credits?**  
A: No maximum. Bank as many as you want (but diminishing returns, better to spend).

**Q: Can enemies destroy my Credits?**  
A: No. Credits can't be destroyed (only spent by you or stolen by specific cards like Divine Audit).

**Q: Does War Profiteer trigger if ally kills enemy?**  
A: Yes. ANY kill within 6 hexes generates Credits (even ally/neutral kills).

**Q: Can I spend Credits during enemy turn?**  
A: Yes. Reactive cards (Insurance Policy, Defense Contract) can be played during enemy turn.
