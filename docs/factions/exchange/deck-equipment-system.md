## Design Philosophy

The Soulstone Exchange embodies faith-backed capitalism. Every card reflects their philosophy:

- **Credit Economy**: Kill enemies to generate Credits, spend for powerful effects
- **Mercenary Management**: Summon temporary allied units to fight for you
- **Economic Warfare**: Force opponents to pay costs or suffer penalties
- **Market Manipulation**: Control battlefield economy, deny resources to enemies
- **Faith + Finance**: Religious sect (Ledger Orthodox) merged with secular bankers (Rational House)
- **Neutral Broker**: Deal with anyone who pays (no morality, pure economics)

---

## Historical Context: The Concordat (Year 73)

### The Union of Church and Commerce

**Year 73 Crisis**: Post-Sundering economy collapsed
- No unified currency (Credits, Soulstones, barter all competing)
- Church monopolized Soulstone production (religious control)
- Merchants couldn't trade across faction borders (no trust)

**The Ledger Orthodox** (Religious Faction):
- Splinter sect from Church of Absolution (Year 52)
- Belief: "God's will is recorded in The Great Ledger"
- All debts/contracts are sacred (breaking contract = sin)
- Soulstones are divine currency (blessed by God)

**The Rational House** (Secular Faction):
- Pre-Sundering banking consortium
- Belief: "Markets self-regulate, faith is irrelevant"
- Currency should be backed by tangible assets (Soulstones have intrinsic value)
- Pragmatic, amoral, efficient

### Year 73: The First Clearinghouse

**The Treaty**:
- Ledger Orthodox provided: Moral authority, Soulstone sanctification, religious legitimacy
- Rational House provided: Financial infrastructure, accounting systems, international networks

**Result**: The Soulstone Exchange founded
- **Monopoly**: Only authorized Soulstone currency issuer
- **Neutrality**: Must trade with all factions (even enemies)
- **Authority**: Church-backed, merchant-operated, universally accepted

## Faction Structure: Orthodox vs. Rational

### The Ledger Orthodox (Religious Wing)

**Beliefs**:
- Every transaction is recorded in "The Great Ledger" (divine book)
- Debts are spiritual bonds (owed to God, not just merchants)
- Interest is divine punishment for poor planning
- Bankruptcy is spiritual failure

**Members**:
- **Brother Balthus the Reckoner** (high priest, enforces contracts)
- Ledger Priests (bless Soulstones, sanctify transactions)
- Debt Collectors (religious enforcers, hunt contract breakers)

**Philosophy**: "The ledger balances. Always."

---

### The Rational House (Secular Wing)

**Beliefs**:
- Markets are amoral (profit is not sin or virtue, just efficiency)
- Emotions cloud judgment (cold calculation always wins)
- Monopoly is stability (competition breeds chaos)
- Survival of the financially fittest

**Members**:
- **Director Ilyara Voss** (CEO, master manipulator)
- Risk Analysts (calculate battlefield economics)
- Mercenary Brokers (hire killers, manage contracts)

**Philosophy**: "Everything has a price. Including loyalty."

## TACTICAL GUIDELINES

### Credit Economy
- **Generation**: War Profiteer (2 Credits per kill, 3 if you killed), Hostile Takeover (4 on kill), War Bonds (3 Credits immediate), Liquidate Assets (2 per Mercenary destroyed)
- **Spending**: Hire Mercenary (3), Insurance Policy (3), Golden Parachute (5), Debt Forgiveness (5), Market Manipulation (2), Premium Ammunition (3)
- **Optimal banking**: Keep 3-5 Credits in reserve for Insurance Policy or emergency Mercenary summon
- **Credit priority**: Summon Mercenaries first (they generate more kills = more Credits), then save for defenses

### Mercenary Management
- **Maximum active**: 2 Mercenaries at once (summon limit)
- **Summon timing**: Wait until you have 6+ Credits (summon 2 Mercenaries immediately for pressure)
- **Buff timing**: Use Contract Enforcement before Mercenaries attack (+2 damage makes them lethal)
- **Sacrifice timing**: Liquidate Assets when Mercenaries are damaged (convert dying units into Credits)
- **Mercenary stats**: 8 HP, 3 damage (fragile but hits hard)

### Economic Warfare Tactics
- **Market Manipulation**: Use when enemies have low SP (forces them to discard cards to pay costs)
- **Economic Leverage**: Use on enemies with powerful next-turn plays (force them to skip or take damage)
- **Bribe**: Use on enemy carry (reduce their damage output by -2 to hit)
- **Executive Order**: Use on enemy tanks (-2 SP next turn cripples their SP economy)

### Defensive Credit Spending
- **Insurance Policy** (3 Credits): Use against lethal attacks (negate all damage once per round)
- **Defense Contract** (1 Credit): Use against moderate attacks (reduce 4 damage for cheap)
- **Golden Parachute** (5 Credits): Use at 5 cards or fewer (resurrect with 8 cards, once per mission)
- **Debt Forgiveness** (5 Credits): Use against lethal damage + low HP (negate + heal 5 cards, once per mission)
