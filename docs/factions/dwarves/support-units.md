## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Units?
Dwarven doctrine emphasizes three engineering pillars. These 3 units represent:
- **Shield Wall Guard**: Impenetrable defense (classic dwarven stubbornness)
- **Bombard Battery**: Artillery superiority (engineering mastery)
- **Rune Sentinel**: Ancient runecraft (magical tradition)

Each unit offers distinct tactical approach while maintaining Dwarven identity: slow, tanky, and devastating.
