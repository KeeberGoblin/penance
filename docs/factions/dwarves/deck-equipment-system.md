## FACTION STRENGTHS

- Highest survivability (32 HP with Stone Endurance + Rune Counters)
- All weapons gain Armor-Piercing (faction bonus ignores defenses)
- Component protection (Unbreakable delays destruction)
- Heat conversion (Forge Fury turns Heat into damage, Forge Mastery into cards)
- Attrition warfare specialists (outlast opponents)

---

## FACTION WEAKNESSES

- Low mobility (Heavy Caskets are slow)
- High Heat generation (constant management required)
- SP-starved (Heavy/Fortress have only 3-4 SP per turn)
- Vulnerable to ranged kiting (slow movement + melee focus)
- Expensive equipment (Dwarven gear costs 5-6 Scrap)

---

## TACTICAL TIPS

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
- Stack Rune Counters immediately (Rune of Protection + Runic Overcharge)
- Position defensively (let enemies come to you)
- Manage Heat carefully (use Breathe the Core proactively)

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
- Use Forge Fury when Heat is high (convert Heat → damage)
- Armor-piercing shuts down defensive opponents
- Unbreakable prevents Component Damage (save for critical hits)

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
- Clan Vengeance should have +4-6 damage by now (devastating)
- Forge Mastery for burst card draw if needed
- Unbreakable Spirit is your safety net (resurrect once)
- Attrition advantage: you have more HP and damage reduction

---

## COUNTER-PLAY (How to Beat Dwarves)

- Attack from range (kite them, avoid melee)
- Destroy Heat Sink Sigils (force Heat overload)
- Target accessories (remove Forge-Rune or Heat Sink)
- Use non-combat win conditions (objectives, time limits)
- Inflict Pilot Wounds (Forge Fear prevents Heat generation)
- Overwhelm with numbers (they're slow to reposition)

---

## CAMPAIGN PROGRESSION

### Starting Loadout (Mission 1)
- Weapon: Warhammer (5 Scrap)
- Offhand: Kite Shield (3 Scrap)
- Accessory: None
- **Total: 8 Scrap investment** (expensive but worth it)

### Mid-Campaign (Mission 5-10)
- Add Forge-Rune Sigil (5 Scrap, faction-exclusive)
- Add Reinforced Plating (4 Scrap)
- Upgrade to Tower Shield (4 Scrap)

### Late-Campaign (Mission 15+)
- Acquire Siege Cannon (6 Scrap, artillery)
- Stack defensive accessories (3-4 accessories on Heavy/Fortress)
- Stone Endurance + max Rune Counters + Reinforced Plating = nearly invincible

## VERSION 3.0 OPTIONAL RULES

### Dwarven Interactions with Taint Exploitation

**Taint Philosophy**: Dwarves **resist Taint through rune-warding**. Stone does not corrupt easily.

**Faction Bonuses**:
- **Rune-Warded**: Gain Taint at **half rate** (6 damage = 1 Taint instead of 2)
- **Stone Endurance**: Cannot be offensively exploited until 8+ Taint (immune to enemy Taint spending below 8)
- **Rune-Locked**: **CANNOT spend own Taint** for Desperate Power (locked out of corruption)

**Strategic Use**: Dwarves are the most Taint-resistant faction. They accumulate Taint slowly and enemies can't exploit it easily. However, they cannot access Desperate Power options (Tainted Fury, Ignore Pain, etc.). Trade-off: Safe from corruption but no Taint burst.

---

### Dwarven Pilot Grit System

**Starting Grit**: **0** (standard)
**Grit Bonus**: **+1 to Grit Checks vs Severe Injuries only** (not Minor or Trauma)

**Stoic Endurance**:
- When rolling Grit Check for Severe Injury: Add +1 (in addition to base Grit)
- Example: Grit 2 pilot vs Severe Injury = roll 1d6 + 2 + 1 = 1d6 + 3

**Grit Check Example** (Dwarven Pilot, Grit 1, Severe Injury):
```
Trigger: Spinal Trauma (Severe Injury)
Roll: 1d6 + 1 Grit + 1 Stoic = 1d6 + 2 = 5
Result: Tough It Out (Severe becomes Minor)
Outcome: Dwarven toughness prevents permanent spinal damage
```

**Thematic Fit**: Dwarves are carved from stone - they don't break easily. Bonus only applies to Severe Injuries (physical trauma), not Trauma (mental) or Minor Injuries.

**END OF DOCUMENT - v3.0 ENHANCED**

*"Steel bends. Stone endures. We are stone wrapped in steel. We do not break."*
