---

## BLEED MECHANIC (Detailed Rules - REVISED - BALANCE NERF)

**Bleed Counters**:
- Stack up to **MAX 10 Bleed counters** per target (Bleed 1 + Bleed 2 = Bleed 3 total, cannot exceed 10)
- Trigger at START of target's turn (before they can act)
- Each counter deals 1 damage
- Counters do NOT expire (last entire mission)
- **NEW CAP**: Bleed damage cannot exceed 10 per turn

**BALANCE NOTE (2025-10-16)**: Original infinite stacking was oppressive in long games (20+ Bleed stacks = automatic win). Cap of 10 maintains lethality while preventing degenerate scaling.

**Example**:
- Turn 1: You hit enemy for Bleed 2
- Turn 2: Enemy starts turn, takes 2 damage, still has Bleed 2
- Turn 2: You hit enemy again for Bleed 3
- Turn 3: Enemy starts turn, takes 5 damage (Bleed 2 + Bleed 3 = Bleed 5 total)

**Strategic Use**:
- Stack Bleed on priority targets (they die slowly but surely)
- Spread Bleed to multiple enemies (everyone takes damage each turn)
- Combine with Apex Predator (+2 damage vs Bleeding targets)
- Combine with Toxin Mastery (double Bleed values)

---

## FACTION STRENGTHS

- Strong damage-over-time (Bleed stacks up to 10, still lethal)
- High mobility (Leaf Dance, Shadow Step, teleports)
- Good regeneration (Verdant Regeneration + conditional Photosynthesis + conditional Living Seal triggers)
- Surgical strikes (Pruning Cut targets specific components)
- Area control (Root Bind, Vine Walls, Seed Pods)

**BALANCE NOTE (2025-10-16)**:
- Bleed capped at 10 stacks (no longer infinite)
- Photosynthesis requires NO DAMAGE TAKEN (conditional trigger)
- Living Seal NO LONGER grants passive +1 card/round (conditional on healing effects)

---

## FACTION WEAKNESSES

- Lower burst damage (relies on damage-over-time)
- Fragile (light armor, low HP pools on Scout builds)
- Requires setup time (Bleed stacks need multiple turns)
- Weak to fast aggro (if killed before Bleed activates, wasted effort)
- Equipment restricted (cannot use heavy weapons, metal armor, firearms)

---

## TACTICAL TIPS

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
- Apply Bleed to all enemies (spread damage-over-time)
- Use mobility to avoid retaliation (Leaf Dance, Shadow Step)
- Set up Vine Walls for area control

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
- Enemies now have Bleed 3-5 (taking 3-5 damage per turn)
- Apex Predator adds +2 damage to attacks vs Bleeding targets
- Photosynthesis triggers (skip attacks to heal)

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
- Enemies have massive Bleed stacks (5-10 damage per turn)
- Focus on survival (they die to Bleed, you just need to not die)
- Verdant Regeneration keeps you alive (2 cards per round passive)

---

## COUNTER-PLAY (How to Beat Elves)

- Rush them down fast (kill before Bleed stacks high)
- Destroy Living Seal Sigil (removes regeneration engine)
- Area attacks hit through mobility (can't dodge AoE)
- Destroy Vine Walls immediately (removes area control)
- Inflict Pilot Wounds that prevent healing
- Use ranged attacks (they're melee-focused)

---

## VERSION 3.0 OPTIONAL RULES

### Elven Interactions with Taint Exploitation

**Taint Philosophy**: Elves are **vulnerable to Taint**. Nature recoils from corruption.

**Faction Penalties**:
- **Fragile Immortals**: Gain Taint at **double rate** (3 damage = 2 Taint instead of 1)
- **Nature's Protection**: Corruption Save is **5+ if in Forest terrain**, otherwise **4+ standard**
- **Regeneration Purge**: "Regeneration" cards now also remove 1 Taint when used

**Elven-Specific Taint Management**:
- Regeneration cards: Heal + remove 1 Taint
- Forest terrain: Stand in Forest at end of turn → remove 1 Taint (passive purge)
- Bleed stacking: Can spend 3 Taint to apply +2 Bleed counters to enemy (trade corruption for DoT)

**Strategic Use**: Elves accumulate Taint FAST (double rate). Must manage it aggressively with Regeneration and Forest positioning. Vulnerable to Taint exploitation by enemies. High-risk glass cannon.

---

### Elven Pilot Grit System

**Starting Grit**: **0** (standard)
**Grit Penalty**: **-1 to all Grit Checks** (always)

**Fragile Immortals**:
- Elven pilots are ageless but emotionally brittle
- All Grit Checks: Roll 1d6 + (Grit - 1)
- Example: Grit 2 pilot = roll 1d6 + 2 - 1 = 1d6 + 1 effective

**Grit Check Example** (Elven Pilot, Grit 2):
```
Trigger: Broken Ribs (Minor Injury)
Roll: 1d6 + 2 - 1 = 1d6 + 1 = 3
Result: Full Wound (flip normally)
Outcome: Elf shatters under pain, cannot tough it out
```

**Max Effective Grit**: 2 (Grit 3 - 1 penalty = effective 2)

**Thematic Fit**: Elves are immortal but unfamiliar with pain. They break psychologically under trauma. Mechanically weaker than other factions but compensated by hit-and-run mobility.

---

**END OF DOCUMENT - v3.0 ENHANCED**

*"We remember the world before the Engine. We remember purity. Taint is anathema. We will not endure."*
