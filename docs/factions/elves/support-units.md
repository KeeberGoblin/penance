## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Units?
Elven doctrine emphasizes three combat pillars. These 3 units represent:
- **Thorn Stalkers**: Hit-and-run mobility (guerrilla warfare)
- **Rootweaver Circle**: Nature magic mastery (terrain control and healing)
- **Shadowleaf Assassin**: Surgical elimination (stealth assassination)

Each unit offers distinct tactical approach while maintaining Elven identity: fast, fragile, and devastating through Bleed and mobility.
