## Design Notes

### Elven Support Unit Philosophy
1. **Mobility > Durability**: Low HP, high Movement
2. **Bleed Synergy**: Every unit applies or benefits from Bleed
3. **Terrain Mastery**: Forest creation and manipulation
4. **Hit-and-Run**: Attack and retreat, never trade blows
5. **Regeneration**: Sustain through healing, not tanking

### Balance Considerations
- **Fragile Units**: Most Elven units have low HP (5-10) to balance their mobility
- **Bleed Cap**: Consider capping Bleed at 10 counters per target to prevent infinite scaling
- **Forest Spam**: Limit Forest creation to prevent map-wide coverage
- **Treant Power**: Ancient Treant is intentionally overpowered (boss-tier unlock reward)
