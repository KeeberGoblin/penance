## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Units?
Elven doctrine emphasizes three combat pillars. These 3 units represent:
- **Thorn Stalkers**: Hit-and-run mobility (guerrilla warfare)
- **Rootweaver Circle**: Nature magic mastery (terrain control and healing)
- **Shadowleaf Assassin**: Surgical elimination (stealth assassination)

Each unit offers distinct tactical approach while maintaining Elven identity: fast, fragile, and devastating through Bleed and mobility.

## Faction Synergies

### With Elven Caskets

- **If using Archers**: Equip defensive Sigils (protect glass cannons)
- **If using Colossus**: Equip two-handed weapon (you have the tank)
- **If using Assassin**: Equip mobility cards (synergy with Shadow Step)
- **If using Treant**: Equip anything (Treant carries the team)

## Example Builds

### BLEED STORM (Aggressive)
**Casket**: Scout (6 SP)
**Support Units**: Thorn Stalkers + Verdant Archers
**Equipment**: Longsword, Buckler, Bleed Sigil
**Strategy**: Maximize Bleed application, overwhelm with DoT

---

### FOREST FORTRESS (Defensive)
**Casket**: Heavy (4 SP)
**Support Units**: Rootweaver Circle + Briarwood Colossus
**Equipment**: Tower Shield, Warhammer, Rune of Regeneration
**Strategy**: Create impenetrable Forest zone, outlast opponents

---

### SURGICAL STRIKE (Elite)
**Casket**: Assault (5 SP)
**Support Units**: Shadowleaf Assassin + Thorn Stalkers
**Equipment**: Spear, Dueling Dagger, Mobility Sigil
**Strategy**: Eliminate high-value targets, never get hit

---

### ANCIENT MIGHT (Ultimate)
**Casket**: Heavy (4 SP)

**Equipment**: None (Treant uses all 5 slots)
**Strategy**: Treant does everything. Casket supports Treant.

---

## Design Notes

### Elven Support Unit Philosophy
1. **Mobility > Durability**: Low HP, high Movement
2. **Bleed Synergy**: Every unit applies or benefits from Bleed
3. **Terrain Mastery**: Forest creation and manipulation
4. **Hit-and-Run**: Attack and retreat, never trade blows
5. **Regeneration**: Sustain through healing, not tanking

### Balance Considerations
- **Fragile Units**: Most Elven units have low HP (5-10) to balance their mobility
- **Bleed Cap**: Consider capping Bleed at 10 counters per target to prevent infinite scaling
- **Forest Spam**: Limit Forest creation to prevent map-wide coverage
- **Treant Power**: Ancient Treant is intentionally overpowered (boss-tier unlock reward)

**"In vine and thorn, we endure. In shadow and silence, we strike."**
