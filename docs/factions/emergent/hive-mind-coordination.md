# Hive-Mind Coordination - Allied Synergies

**Philosophy**: "MULTI SUMUS, UNUM SUMUS" (We Are Many, We Are One)

The Emergent Syndicate's greatest strength is **collective action**. Individual units are moderate threats, but coordinated swarms are devastating.

## Core Hive-Mind Mechanics

### 1. Swarm Intelligence (Passive Token Generation)

**Effect**: Gain +1 Metamorph token at start of each round. **If 3+ allied Emergent Syndicate Caskets are within 4 hexes**, gain +2 tokens instead.

**Why This Matters**:
- Solo Syndicate pilot: 1 token/round (slow buildup)
- Grouped Syndicate swarm: 2 tokens/round (double speed)
- **Result**: Grouped Syndicate pilots transform twice as fast

**Tactical Application**:
- **Always stay grouped** (within 4 hexes of 2+ allies)
- Sacrifice mobility for proximity (token generation > positioning)
- Use **Hivemind Beacon** to pull scattered allies back into range

---

### 2. Hive-Mind Link (Ability Copying)

**Effect**: When an allied Emergent Syndicate Casket within 4 hexes plays a card, you may spend 1 Metamorph token to copy that card's effect (reduced effectiveness: half damage/healing).

**Examples**:
- Ally uses **Arthropod Fury** (6 damage) → You copy for 3 damage (cost: 1 token)
- Ally uses **Exoskeleton Molt** (reduce 3 damage, recover 2 cards) → You copy for reduce 1.5 damage, recover 1 card
- Ally uses **Pheromone Command** (buff allies +1 damage/SP) → You copy for +0.5 damage/SP (rounds down)

**Why This Is Powerful**:
- Turn expensive ally cards into cheap copies for yourself
- **Action economy**: Multiple pilots using same effect = multiplied value
- Copy defensive cards when threatened, offensive when aggressive

**Tactical Application**:
- **Coordinate timing**: Ally uses expensive card → all nearby pilots copy it
- **Example combo**: Ally uses Forced Evolution (3 tokens, all 3 forms) → 3 nearby allies each spend 1 token to copy (half effect) = entire swarm gains +1 damage/+1.5 Defense/+1 movement for 4 total tokens instead of 12

---

### 3. Collective Consciousness (Resource Sharing)

**Effect**: Choose 1 allied Emergent Syndicate Casket within 6 hexes. They immediately draw 2 cards and gain 1 Metamorph token.

**Why This Is Critical**:
- **救助 struggling allies** (low cards/tokens = useless, give them resources)
- Prepare ally for transformation (they need 2 tokens, you give them 1)
- **Card draw = options** (ally stuck with bad hand, give them 2 new cards)

**Tactical Application**:
- **Identify bottleneck ally** (who needs resources most?)
- Use on ally about to transform (they have 1 token, need 2 → you give them 1)
- Use on ally with strong cards but no draw (they need specific card in deck)

---

### 4. Pheromone Command (Area Buff/Debuff)

**Effect**: Release pheromone cloud. All allied Emergent Syndicate Caskets within 5 hexes gain +1 damage and +1 SP this turn. Enemies within range have -1 to hit.

**Why This Is Team-Defining**:
- **Every Syndicate ally gets +1 damage and +1 SP** (incredible value if 3+ allies)
- **Every enemy gets -1 to hit** (defensive + offensive simultaneously)
- **5-hex range** = covers entire battlefield if positioned centrally

**Tactical Application**:
- **Use every turn** if you have 3+ allies nearby (2 SP for +3-5 damage team-wide = absurd value)
- Position centrally (maximize ally/enemy coverage)
- Coordinate with **Hive-Mind Assault** (buff then trigger coordinated strike)

---

### 5. Hive-Mind Assault (Coordinated Strike)

**Effect**: All allied Emergent Syndicate Caskets within 5 hexes immediately make a 2-damage attack against their nearest enemy.

**Why This Is Ultimate Hive Ability**:
- **Costs 4 SP**, but **all allies attack simultaneously** (0 SP cost to them)
- **Example**: You + 3 allies = 4×2 damage = 8 damage total for 4 SP
- **Scales infinitely** with ally count (6 allies = 12 damage for 4 SP)

**Tactical Application**:
- **Always use with Pheromone Command first** (allies gain +1 damage → 3 damage per attack instead of 2)
- Coordinate timing (wait until all allies are in range and have valid targets)
- **Finish wounded enemies** (2 damage per ally = perfect execute damage)

## Hive Coordination Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Swarm (4+ Syndicate Pilots)

**Composition**: All players are Emergent Syndicate

**Tactics**:
1. **Stay grouped** (all within 4 hexes of each other)
2. **Swarm Intelligence** gives everyone +2 tokens/round (double speed)
3. **Pheromone Command** every turn (buff entire team +1 damage/SP, debuff all enemies -1 hit)
4. **Hive-Mind Link** chains (pilot 1 uses expensive card → pilots 2, 3, 4 copy it for 1 token each)
5. **Hive-Mind Assault** finisher (4 pilots × 3 damage with Pheromone buff = 12 damage coordinated strike for 4 SP)

**Strengths**:
- Overwhelming action economy (4 pilots acting as 1 organism)
- Infinite token generation (everyone gets +2/round)
- Unkillable (constant molting, Chrysalis Rebirth safety nets)

**Weaknesses**:
- Vulnerable to area attacks (grouped = AoE target)
- Slow start (need 2-3 rounds to build tokens)
- Requires coordination (random pub games struggle)

---

### Strategy 2: The Support Core (1 Coordinator + 3 Any Faction)

**Composition**: 1 Emergent Syndicate "Hive Coordinator" + 3 non-Syndicate allies

**Tactics**:
1. Syndicate pilot uses **Hive-Mind Link** to copy non-Syndicate ally abilities (cross-faction synergy)
2. **Pheromone Command** buffs non-Syndicate allies too (+1 damage/SP to all allies, not just Syndicate)
3. **Collective Consciousness** gives non-Syndicate allies card draw (shares resources across factions)
4. **Compound Vision** prevents flanking (protect allies from ambushes)

**Strengths**:
- Cross-faction synergy (Syndicate support works with anyone)
- Flexible (Syndicate pilot adapts to any team comp)
- Pheromone Command is universal buff (not faction-locked)

**Weaknesses**:
- Solo Syndicate pilot only gets +1 token/round (no Swarm Intelligence bonus)
- Hive-Mind Assault only triggers Syndicate allies (useless in mixed teams)
- Metamorph tokens harder to build (no allied Syndicate to share with)

---

### Strategy 3: The Solo Metamorph (1 Syndicate Pilot Alone)

**Composition**: 1 Emergent Syndicate pilot, no allies

**Tactics**:
1. **Ignore hive-mind cards** (Hive-Mind Link, Collective Consciousness, Pheromone Command, Hive-Mind Assault are useless solo)
2. **Focus on transformations** (Metamorphic Adaptation, Forced Evolution, Chrysalis Rebirth)
3. **Molt for survival** (Exoskeleton Molt, Arthropod Regeneration, Reactive Carapace)
4. **Compound Vision** prevents flanking (anti-ambush safety)

**Strengths**:
- Self-sufficient (doesn't need allies)
- High survivability (molt + resurrect)
- 360° vision (can't be ambushed)

**Weaknesses**:
- Slow token generation (+1/round instead of +2)
- No hive-mind synergies (half the faction cards are useless)
- Lower damage output (no Pheromone Command buffs)

## Advanced Hive Tactics

### Tactic 1: Chain Copying

**Setup**: 3+ Syndicate pilots grouped

**Execution**:
1. Pilot 1 uses expensive card (e.g., Forced Evolution for 3 tokens)
2. Pilots 2, 3, 4 each spend 1 token to copy via Hive-Mind Link
3. **Result**: All 4 pilots gain transformation benefits for 6 total tokens (instead of 12 if each used Forced Evolution separately)

**Value**: 50% token savings on expensive abilities

---

### Tactic 2: Token Economy Engine

**Setup**: 4 Syndicate pilots grouped

**Execution**:
1. All pilots stay within 4 hexes (Swarm Intelligence gives +2 tokens/round each)
2. Each round, 1 pilot uses Collective Consciousness on ally who just transformed (refunds 1 token + gives 2 cards)
3. **Result**: Net token generation = +1.5 tokens/round per pilot (after accounting for transformations)

**Value**: Sustainable transformation spam

---

### Tactic 3: Pheromone Alpha Strike

**Setup**: 4 Syndicate pilots + 1 enemy group

**Execution**:
1. All pilots move into 5-hex range of target enemy group
2. Pilot 1 uses Pheromone Command (all allies +1 damage/SP, enemies -1 hit)
3. All pilots attack simultaneously (everyone deals +1 damage)
4. Pilot 2 uses Hive-Mind Assault (all pilots make additional 2 damage attacks, boosted to 3 by Pheromone)
5. **Result**: 4 pilots × (normal attack + 3 coordinated damage) = 16+ damage in 1 turn to grouped enemies

**Value**: Instant enemy team wipe

---

### Tactic 4: Defensive Molt Chain

**Setup**: 3 Syndicate pilots under heavy fire

**Execution**:
1. Pilot 1 takes 6 damage → uses Exoskeleton Molt (reduce to 3, recover 2 cards)
2. Pilots 2 and 3 spend 1 token each to copy molt via Hive-Mind Link (reduce 1.5 damage, recover 1 card each)
3. **Result**: Entire team reduces damage and heals for 3 total tokens instead of 1 token each

**Value**: Team-wide damage reduction for cheap

## Hive-Mind Checklist

**Before Each Round**:
- [ ] Are 3+ allied Syndicate pilots within 4 hexes? (Swarm Intelligence bonus)
- [ ] Does any ally need tokens/cards? (Collective Consciousness target)
- [ ] Is Pheromone Command available? (Use every turn if 3+ allies present)
- [ ] Did ally just use expensive card? (Hive-Mind Link copy opportunity)

**During Combat**:
- [ ] Stay grouped (sacrifice positioning for token generation)
- [ ] Coordinate transformations (don't all transform same turn, stagger for sustained pressure)
- [ ] Share resources (Collective Consciousness on struggling allies)
- [ ] Communicate (call out when using expensive cards so allies can copy)

**After Combat**:
- [ ] Did anyone use Chrysalis Rebirth? (Once per mission, track carefully)
- [ ] Are token banks healthy? (Each pilot should have 2-4 tokens reserve)
- [ ] Did we over-molt? (Once per round limit, plan better next time)
