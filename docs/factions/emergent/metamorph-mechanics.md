# Metamorph Mechanics - Transformation System

**Core Resource**: Metamorph Tokens  
**Transformation Types**: 3 (Assault, Tank, Scout) + 1 Ultimate (Forced Evolution)

## Metamorph Token Economy

### Generating Tokens

**Primary Generation**:
- **Swarm Intelligence** (Passive): Gain +1 token at start of each round
  - **Bonus**: +2 tokens if 3+ allied Syndicate Caskets within 4 hexes

**Secondary Generation**:
- **Metamorph Serum** (2 SP): Target gains +2 tokens immediately
- **Collective Consciousness** (1 SP): Target ally gains +1 token (plus draws 2 cards)

**Natural Cap**: No hard limit, but transformations typically cost 2-5 tokens

### Spending Tokens

| Ability | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Metamorphic Adaptation** | 2 tokens | Transform into 1 form (Assault/Tank/Scout) |
| **Forced Evolution** | 3 tokens | Gain ALL 3 forms simultaneously |
| **Chrysalis Rebirth** | 5 tokens | Resurrect at low HP (once per mission) |
| **Exoskeleton Molt** | 1 token | Reduce damage by 3, recover 2 cards |
| **Reactive Carapace** | 1 token | Reduce damage by 4 (enhanced) |
| **Exoskeleton Plating** | 4 tokens | Negate all damage from 1 attack |
| **Arthropod Fury** | 1 token | +2 damage to single attack (6→8) |

## Three Transformation Forms

### Assault Form
**Cost**: 2 Metamorph tokens (via Metamorphic Adaptation)  
**Duration**: Until end of round  
**Effects**:
- **+2 damage to all attacks** (applies to every attack you make this round)
- **-1 Defense** (vulnerable while aggressive)

**Best Used When**:
- Enemies are grouped (maximize multi-target damage)
- You're healthy (can afford Defense penalty)
- Need burst damage to finish wounded targets
- Have support/healing available

**Synergies**:
- **Chitin Claws**: 4 damage → 5 damage with Assault Form
- **Multi-Limb Barrage**: 6 damage → 8 damage total
- **Segmented Strike**: 4+2 damage → 6+4 damage (10 total)

---

### Tank Form
**Cost**: 2 Metamorph tokens (via Metamorphic Adaptation)  
**Duration**: Until end of round  
**Effects**:
- **+3 Defense** (significantly harder to damage)
- **-1 movement** (slow but unstoppable)

**Best Used When**:
- Focused by multiple enemies (survive concentrated fire)
- Low HP (need to outlast until healing)
- Protecting allies (draw aggro as tank)
- Boss phase transitions (survival priority)

**Synergies**:
- **Exoskeleton Molt**: +3 Defense + molt reactions = extreme survivability
- **Reactive Carapace**: Stack with Tank Form for absurd damage reduction
- **Chrysalis Rebirth**: Enter Tank Form before resurrection for guaranteed survival

---

### Scout Form
**Cost**: 2 Metamorph tokens (via Metamorphic Adaptation)  
**Duration**: Until end of round  
**Effects**:
- **+2 movement** (7 hexes total per turn)
- **Ignore terrain** (move through difficult terrain, water, obstacles)

**Best Used When**:
- Need repositioning (escape, flank, reach objectives)
- Chasing wounded enemies (execute fleeing targets)
- Avoiding area effects (get out of danger zones)
- Reconnaissance (scout ahead without risk)

**Synergies**:
- **Segmented Lash**: 2-hex range + Scout mobility = hit-and-run kiting
- **Hivemind Beacon**: Pull allies toward you, then Scout away (coordinate positioning)
- **Compound Vision**: 360° vision + Scout mobility = perfect scouting

## Ultimate Transformation: Forced Evolution

**Cost**: 3 Metamorph tokens  
**Duration**: Until end of round  
**Effects**: Gain **ALL THREE** forms simultaneously:
- **+2 damage to all attacks** (Assault)
- **+3 Defense** (Tank)
- **+2 movement, ignore terrain** (Scout)

**Additional**:
- Generate +2 Heat (overstrain warning)
- Cannot use again until Heat is reduced below 3

**Best Used When**:
- Desperate situation (final push or emergency)
- Boss phase (need maximum power spike)
- Outnumbered (survive + damage + mobility all critical)
- Have Heat management available (don't overheat)

**Synergies**:
- **Arthropod Fury**: 6 damage base + 2 (Assault) + 2 (token boost) = 10 damage single attack
- **Multi-Limb Barrage**: 6 damage + 2 (Assault) = 8 damage split 3 ways
- **Chrysalis Rebirth**: Use Forced Evolution → get low → resurrect → repeat

## Transformation Stacking Rules

### Can Stack Multiple Transformations?
**Yes, with multiple uses of Metamorphic Adaptation:**
- **Example**: Use Metamorphic Adaptation twice (4 tokens total)
  - Round 1: Transform into Assault Form (+2 damage, -1 Defense)
  - Round 2: Transform into Tank Form (+3 Defense, -1 movement)
  - **Result**: +2 damage, +2 Defense (net), -1 movement

**Practical Stacking**:
- Assault + Tank = Balanced form (+2 damage, +2 Defense net, -1 movement)
- Assault + Scout = Mobile striker (+2 damage, +2 movement, ignore terrain, -1 Defense)
- Tank + Scout = Defensive scout (+3 Defense, +1 movement net, ignore terrain)

**Forced Evolution = All 3 Stacked**:
- No need to manually stack—gain all bonuses automatically

## Molt Mechanics

### What is Molting?

**Molt = Shed damaged exoskeleton, regrow stronger:**
- Triggered by **Exoskeleton Molt** (reactive card)
- Reduces incoming damage
- Recovers cards (healing)
- Can only molt **once per round** (biological limit)

### Molt Timing

**Optimal Use**:
1. **Wait for big attacks** (5+ damage incoming)
2. **Molt reactively** (reduce damage by 3, minimum 1)
3. **Recover 2 cards** from discard pile (healing)
4. **Gain Heat +1** (warning: don't spam)

**Molt Combos**:
- **Exoskeleton Molt** → **Arthropod Regeneration** = 2 + 5 cards recovered (7 total healing)
- **Molt** + **Tank Form** = Reduce 3 damage + have +3 Defense = nearly invincible
- **Molt** + **Reactive Carapace** = Reduce 3 + 4 = 7 damage negated from one attack

## Advanced Transformation Tactics

### Opening Round (Turn 1-2)
- **Don't transform yet** (save tokens)
- Generate tokens through **Swarm Intelligence**
- Position with allies (get +2 tokens if 3+ nearby)
- Bank 4-6 tokens before first transformation

### Mid-Game (Turn 3-6)
- **Transform reactively** (match form to threat):
  - Facing multiple enemies → **Tank Form**
  - Enemies grouped → **Assault Form**
  - Need to escape/flank → **Scout Form**
- Molt when taking 5+ damage
- Use **Collective Consciousness** to share tokens with struggling allies

### Late-Game (Turn 7+)
- **Forced Evolution** when critical (boss phase, desperate situation)
- **Chrysalis Rebirth** available at 5 cards or fewer (resurrection safety net)
- Stack transformations (4+ tokens = multiple forms active)
- Coordinate **Hive-Mind Assault** with transformed allies for massive coordinated strike

## Metamorph Mistakes to Avoid

### X Don't Transform Too Early
**Problem**: Waste tokens before threats emerge  
**Solution**: Bank 4-6 tokens first, transform reactively

### X Don't Spam Molt
**Problem**: Once per round limit, generates Heat  
**Solution**: Save molt for 5+ damage attacks, manage Heat

### X Don't Ignore Allies
**Problem**: Swarm Intelligence gives +2 tokens with 3+ allies nearby  
**Solution**: Stay grouped, share tokens with Collective Consciousness

### X Don't Use Forced Evolution Casually
**Problem**: Costs 3 tokens + 2 Heat, can't spam  
**Solution**: Save for boss phases or desperate situations

### X Don't Forget Hive-Mind Link
**Problem**: Can copy ally abilities for 1 token (incredible value)  
**Solution**: When ally uses powerful card, immediately copy it for half effect

## Transformation Checklist

**Before Transforming**:
- [ ] Do I have 2+ Metamorph tokens?
- [ ] What threat am I facing (grouped enemies? Heavy damage? Need mobility?)
- [ ] Can I afford the form penalty (-1 Defense or -1 movement)?
- [ ] Do I have support/healing if Assault Form makes me vulnerable?

**After Transforming**:
- [ ] Maximize form benefits this round (don't waste transformation)
- [ ] Track duration (until end of round—plan next round actions)
- [ ] Consider stacking (do I need a second form active?)
- [ ] Prepare for next transformation (rebuild tokens)
