# Emergent Syndicate - Support Units
## Penance: Hive-Mind, Swarm Intelligence, and Unity

## 1. DRONE SWARM
**Category**: Infantry (Swarm/Scout)
**HP**: 8 | **Movement**: 5 | **Defense**: 0
**Equipment Slots**: 2
**Theme**: Hundreds of insect-sized networked drones acting as single organism

### Visual Description
A cloud of metallic insects - each the size of a hornet, with gossamer wings and sensor arrays. They move in impossible synchronization, forming shapes mid-air: arrows, hands, faces. When they attack, the swarm becomes a whirling razor tornado. Individual drones are fragile. The swarm is lethal.

## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Faction Units + 2 Neutral?
Syndicate doctrine is "collective strength." They have:
- **3 Core Units**: Swarms, coordinators, converters
- **2 Neutral Units**: Available to all factions (ex-Syndicate mercenaries)

### Network Mechanics
All Syndicate units benefit from being near each other (5-hex network range). This encourages:
- Grouping units
- Protecting Synapse Node
- Creating overlapping networks
