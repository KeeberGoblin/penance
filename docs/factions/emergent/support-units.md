## FACTION SYNERGIES

| Allied Faction | Synergy | Anti-Synergy |
|----------------|---------|--------------|
| **Church** | Molt Guardian tanks while Church self-harms | Metamorph tokens don't synergize with Blood Offering |
| **Dwarves** | Both defensive, Guardian + Shield Wall = fortress | Both slow, lack mobility |
| **Ossuarium** | Drone Swarm scouts for undead thralls | None significant |
| **Elves** | Evolution Catalyst buffs Elven archers | None |
| **Vestige** | Apex Predator + Pack Hunters = savage melee | None |
| **Crucible** | Hive-mind coordination + Honor Duels = tactical depth | None |
| **Exchange** | Can hire Emergent units with Credits (mercenaries) | None |

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Identity: Chosen Evolution
- **Not victims**: Emergent chose transformation (unlike Vestige/Blighted)
- **Scientific**: Controlled mutation, not chaotic corruption
- **Collective**: Hive-mind coordination, not individual heroics
- **Adaptive**: Change forms mid-battle, answer any threat

### Gameplay Pattern
- **Token Economy**: Generate and spend Metamorph tokens
- **Transformation**: Change forms based on battlefield needs
- **Coordination**: Buff allies, debuff enemies with pheromones
- **Swarm**: Multiple small units vs single large units

### Counterplay
- **AOE Attacks**: Punish clustering (Drone Swarm, Hive Spawn vulnerable)
- **Burst Damage**: Kill before they molt/transform
- **Debuff Immunity Negation**: Target non-Syndicate units
- **Isolation**: Separate from hive (reduce token generation)

---

**"We are many. We are one. We are the inevitable evolution."**
