## EMERGENT SUPPORT UNITS OVERVIEW (DRAFT)

**Starting Units**:
1. Drone Swarm - Flying harassment unit
2. Molt Guardian - Defensive chitin tank
3. Adaptation Form - Metamorphing utility unit

**Unlockable Units**:
4. Hive Spawn - Reproducing bio-mass
5. Evolution Catalyst - Support buffer

**Design Philosophy**: Emergent units should reflect metamorphosis mechanics. Units gain counters, evolve forms, and adapt to threats during battle.

## DESIGN NOTES

**Status**: This file is a placeholder template. Full support units design requires:

1. **Core Mechanics**: How do Emergent units interact with Metamorph tokens?
2. **Evolution System**: Do units evolve like Caskets? How many forms?
3. **Hive-Mind Integration**: How do support units benefit from coordinated actions?
4. **Molt Mechanics**: Do units leave behind resources when destroyed?

**Recommended Approach**: Use [Vestige Bloodlines support-units.md](../vestige-bloodlines/support-units.md) and [Exchange support-units.md](../exchange/support-units.md) as templates.

**Faction Identity to Preserve**:
- Transformation/adaptation
- Organic/biological aesthetic
- Hive-mind coordination
- Evolution through combat

**"We adapt. We evolve. We are inevitable."**
