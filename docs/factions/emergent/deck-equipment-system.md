## Design Philosophy

The Emergent Syndicate embodies chosen evolution. Every card reflects their philosophy:

- **Hive-Mind Coordination**: Actions that benefit multiple Syndicate units simultaneously
- **Metamorphic Adaptation**: Transform mid-battle to gain new capabilities
- **Multi-Limb Advantage**: Extra actions and attacks from additional arthropod limbs
- **Pheromone Communication**: Buff allies and debuff enemies through chemical signals
- **Exoskeleton Defense**: Molt to heal, shed damage, gain armor layers
- **Scientific Evolution**: They chose this transformation (not victims like Blighted or Vestige)

## TACTICAL GUIDELINES

### Metamorph Token Economy
- **Generation**: Swarm Intelligence (1-2 per round), Metamorph Serum, Collective Consciousness
- **Spending**: Transformations (2-5 tokens), enhanced defense (1-4 tokens), damage boosts (1 token)
- **Optimal banking**: Keep 2-3 tokens in reserve for emergency Exoskeleton Molt or Reactive Carapace
- **Token sharing**: Use Collective Consciousness to distribute tokens to allies who need transformations

### Transformation Timing
- **Assault Form**: Use when enemies are grouped, you're healthy, need burst damage
- **Tank Form**: Use when focused by multiple enemies, low HP, need to survive
- **Scout Form**: Use for repositioning, escaping, reaching objectives, ignoring terrain
- **Forced Evolution**: Save for critical moments (boss phase, desperate situation, final push)

### Hive-Mind Coordination
- **Position within 4 hexes**: Swarm Intelligence gives +1 token, Hive-Mind Link range, Pheromone Command reaches all
- **Coordinate attacks**: Use Hive-Mind Assault for synchronized strikes
- **Share resources**: Collective Consciousness distributes tokens and cards to whoever needs them
- **Communication**: Pheromone Command debuffs enemies while buffing allies (use every turn if possible)

### Molting Strategy
- **Don't molt prematurely**: Wait until you've taken 5+ damage to maximize value
- **Molt before big attacks**: If enemy telegraphs high-damage attack, molt reactively to negate
- **Molt combos**: Exoskeleton Molt → Arthropod Regeneration = 2 + 3-5 cards recovered = massive healing
- **Once per round limit**: Plan carefully, can't spam molts

## DESIGN NOTES

### Balance Considerations
- **Token Economy**: Powerful but requires buildup (weak early, strong mid-late)
- **Ally Dependency**: Many cards scale with allies (stronger in team games, weaker solo)
- **Transformation Versatility**: Three forms cover all situations but require planning
- **Hive-Mind Risk**: Lose one Emergent ally = lose significant synergies

### Unique Mechanics
- **Metamorph Tokens**: Separate resource from SP, generated through synergies
- **Multi-Form Transformations**: Can stack forms with enough tokens (unique to Emergent)
- **Hive-Mind Copying**: Hive-Mind Link copies ally abilities (unprecedented mechanic)
- **360° Vision**: Compound Vision anti-flank passive (only faction with this)
- **Molt Healing**: Exoskeleton Molt reactive defense + healing (defensive lifesteal)

### Counterplay
- **Against Emergent**: Isolate members, kill token generators first (Swarm Intelligence users), area denial, prevent grouping
- **Emergent Counters**: Church (auto-hit ignores Compound Vision), Dwarves (high Defense counters multi-hit), Elves (Root Bind prevents Scout Form escapes)

---

## CAMPAIGN INTEGRATION

### Early Campaign Hooks
- **Quest**: "First Contact" - Investigate strange signals from Sibarian ruins
- **Quest**: "The Offer" - Syndicate offers to "improve" player through metamorphosis
- **Quest**: "Specimen Retrieval" - Syndicate hires players to capture live Abominations

### Mid Campaign Conflicts
- **Faction War**: Syndicate vs Church (holy war against "science abominations")
- **Political Crisis**: Syndicate offers cure to Vestige (at cost of joining collective)
- **Moral Dilemma**: Syndicate experiments on unwilling subjects—stop them or ignore?

### Late Campaign Endgame
- **Alliance Option**: Join Syndicate (become part of hive-mind, gain metamorphosis)
- **Destruction Option**: Destroy Sibarian facility (end forced evolution experiments)
- **Synthesis Option**: Negotiate compromise (regulated evolution, ethical guidelines)
