# Asymmetric Casket Types by Faction
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

Version: 2.0 (Equipment System Overhaul)
Last Updated: October 11, 2025

---

## Design Philosophy

Each faction builds Caskets that reflect their ideology, culture, and relationship with death. There are no universal "weight classes" - a Church Confessor and an Ossuarium Revenant might both be fast and light, but they achieve it through completely different means and play entirely differently.

**Mechanical Framework**:
- Each faction has 4 Casket types (Scout/Assault/Heavy/Fortress)
- Each type has unique mechanics tied to faction identity
- Stats are balanced but asymmetric (same power level, different playstyle)
- No two factions share the same mechanic

**Equipment System v2.0**:
- **Deck sizes are now variable** based on equipment loadout
- Each Casket class has different equipment slots:
  - **Scout (Light)**: 1 Weapon + 1 Shield/Offhand + 1 Accessory = 26-30 cards total
  - **Assault (Medium)**: 1 Weapon + 1 Shield/Offhand + 2 Accessories = 28-35 cards total
  - **Heavy**: 1 Weapon + 1 Shield/Offhand + 3 Accessories = 32-40 cards total
  - **Fortress (Ultra-Heavy)**: 1 2-handed Weapon + 0-1 Shield/Offhand + 4 Accessories = 35-50 cards total
- Equipment card counts vary (Light weapon=3-4 cards, Heavy weapon=6-9 cards)
- Base deck: 10 Universal Core + 6 Faction Core + X Equipment + 2 Tactics
- **Example**: Scout with Dagger (3) + Buckler (2) + Sigil (3) = 26 cards total
- **Example**: Fortress with Greatsword (8) + 4 Accessories (12) = 38 cards total

# DESIGN NOTES

## Balance Framework

All Casket types balanced around these benchmarks:

**Light Frames**:
- 600-750 lbs
- 3-4 SP
- 6-9 Movement
- 0-2 Armor
- 25 cards
- High mobility, low survivability

**Medium Frames**:
- 900-1,200 lbs
- 4 SP
- 4-5 Movement
- 2-3 Armor
- 30 cards
- Balanced stats

**Heavy Frames**:
- 1,300-1,700 lbs
- 3 SP
- 3-4 Movement
- 3-5 Armor
- 35 cards
- Tank role

**Assault Frames**:
- 1,900-2,400 lbs
- 2 SP
- 2-4 Movement
- 4-5 Armor
- 40 cards
- Siege/support platform

## Playtesting Priorities

1. **Test faction vs same faction first** (mirror match balance)
2. **Then cross-faction** (asymmetry balance)
3. **Focus on "feel"** - Does Church feel like religious zealots? Do Undead feel immortal?
4. **Watch for dominant strategies** - If everyone plays Fae Trickster, nerf
5. **Embrace asymmetry** - Don't over-balance. Some matchups should be hard

## Expansion Potential

Each faction can get:
- Variant Caskets (same weight class, different mechanics)
- Named Hero units (specific pilots with unique cards)
- Faction-specific mission types
- Legendary equipment locked to faction
