# The Wyrd Conclave - Complete Deck & Equipment System
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Faction Motto**: "REALITY IS NEGOTIABLE" (Everything has a price)

**Playstyle**: Reality distortion, bargain mechanics, stolen identities, illusion warfare
**Core Mechanic**: Bargain Tokens - Make deals with twisted costs, steal enemy abilities
**Frame Type**: Scout (6 SP per turn)

---

## Design Philosophy

The Wyrd Conclave are Fae tricksters who weaponize reality itself. Every card reflects their philosophy:

- **Bargain Economy**: Make powerful deals, but pay hidden costs
- **Reality Distortion**: Cards that break normal game rules
- **Stolen Faces**: Copy and use enemy abilities
- **Illusion Warfare**: Create fake threats, confuse enemies
- **Temporal Manipulation**: Reorder turns, rewind actions
- **Incomprehensible Logic**: Mechanics that don't make logical sense (by design)
- **Fae Trickery**: Cards with dual effects (help AND harm simultaneously)

---

## Historical Context: Between Worlds

### Pre-Sundering Origins

**The Fae Courts** (Pre-Sundering dimensional beings):
- Existed "between" dimensions (not fully in material world)
- Fed on mortal creativity, emotion, and wonder
- Made bargains with mortals (power for abstract costs)
- Incomprehensible alien intelligence (logic humans can't grasp)

---

### Year 0: The Sundering & Dimensional Collapse

**When Theslar activated the Engine**:
- Void energy tore holes between dimensions
- Fae Courts forcibly pulled into material world
- **Trapped**: Can no longer fully return to Feywild
- **Weakened**: Lost much of their reality-warping power
- **Changed**: Now need physical bodies (stolen from mortals)

**The Aftermath**:
- Fae began stealing faces (literally replacing people)
- Created Caskets from impossible materials (not metal, not organic - *other*)
- **Named themselves**: "The Wyrd Conclave" (assembly of the strange)
- Desperate to return home, but the way is sealed

---

### Year 1-437: Tricksters Trapped

**Current Status**: ~300 Fae trapped in material world
- Each has stolen 2-10 identities (wear faces like masks)
- Pilot Caskets made from "folded reality" (space bent into armor)
- **Goal**: Find way back to Feywild (or reshape this world into new Feywild)
- Make bargains to gather power, knowledge, and leverage

**Fae Structure**:
- **No hierarchy** (every Fae is independent agent)
- **Alliances of convenience** (betray each other constantly)
- **Speak in riddles** (incomprehensible to mortals)
- **Bargain obsession** (compulsion to make deals)

**Territory**: Wherever dimensional walls are thin
- The Shimmer Wastes (reality distortions, mirages)
- Forgotten corners of the world (abandoned cities where Fae wear stolen faces)
- Between places (crossroads, borders, thresholds)

---

## TACTICAL GUIDELINES

### Bargain Token Economy
- **Generation**: Bargain Struck (1/turn passive), Fae Bargain (3 if accepted), Bargain Siphon (2 if accepted), Phase Cut (1 on kill)
- **Spending**: Stolen Face (3), Reality Fracture (4), Fae Bargain (0, generates instead), Mirror Self (5), Deal with the Devil (0, generates 5)
- **Optimal banking**: Keep 4-5 tokens for Reality Fracture (emergency rewind) or Price Paid (death prevention)
- **Never go to 0**: Always keep 1-2 tokens minimum (safety net)

### Bargain Forcing
- **Fae Bargain**: Offer "5 damage OR 3 tokens" - enemies often give tokens (you profit)
- **Bargain Siphon**: Offer "Miss OR 2 tokens" - enemies hate missing, give tokens
- **Fae Pact**: Offer "Mind control OR 8 damage" - enemies choose lesser evil, you win either way
- **Pattern**: Always make offer worse than reality (they choose bad option, you gain)

### Illusion Tactics
- **Mirror Self**: Create 2-3 illusions, surround enemy (they guess wrong 75% of the time)
- **Shimmer Veil**: Go invisible, reposition behind enemy, attack from unexpected angle
- **Mirror Realm**: Drop on objective, defend with fake army (enemies waste turns)
- **Fae Mirror**: Cheap illusion spam (2 tokens = 2 illusions = 4 targets for enemy to guess)

### Temporal Abuse
- **Reality Fracture**: Use after catastrophic turn (got hit for 10 damage, rewind, avoid it)
- **Between Moments**: Use for burst offense (2 turns in a row = 10 SP of attacks)
- **Temporal Loop**: Store big hit (enemy deals 8 damage, redirect to THEIR ally next turn)

---

## CAMPAIGN INTEGRATION

### Early Campaign Hooks
- **Quest**: "The Bargain" - Fae offer to solve players' problem (for a price)
- **Quest**: "The Doppelganger" - NPC has been replaced by Fae, players must identify who

### Mid Campaign Conflicts
- **Faction War**: Wyrd Conclave vs. Church (Fae steal Church relics for dimensional research)
- **Political Crisis**: Fae replace town's leadership with doppelgangers (town goes mad)
- **Moral Dilemma**: Fae offer to cure player's Taint (cost: sacrifice friend's identity)

### Late Campaign Endgame
- **Alliance Option**: Join Wyrd Conclave (become Fae-touched, gain reality powers, lose humanity)
- **Destruction Option**: Close dimensional rifts permanently (trap Fae forever, they become mortal)
- **Synthesis Option**: Bargain with Lady Whisper (negotiate new equilibrium, Fae stay but restricted)
