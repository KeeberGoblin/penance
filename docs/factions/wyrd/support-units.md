# The Wyrd Conclave - Support Units
## Penance: Reality Benders, Tricksters, and Oath Enforcers

**Version**: 3.0 Equipment System (Asymmetric)
**Date**: October 16, 2025

The Wyrd Conclave fields illusions, changelings, and oath-bound servants. Each unit represents a different aspect of fae trickery: pixies sowing confusion, changelings stealing faces, and contract enforcers punishing oathbreakers.

## WYRD SUPPORT UNITS OVERVIEW

**Faction-Specific Units** (Choose 1):
1. Pixie Swarm (2 Equipment Slots)
2. Changeling Infiltrator (2 Equipment Slots)
3. Oath-Bound Servants (3 Equipment Slots)

**Note**: Wyrd doctrine emphasizes three pillars of fae warfare: mischievous disruption, deceptive infiltration, and binding enforcement. These 3 units represent core Wyrd philosophy: reality manipulation through bargains, trickery, and teleportation.

## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Units?
Wyrd doctrine emphasizes three aspects of fae manipulation. These 3 units represent:
- **Pixie Swarm**: Mischievous disruption (token theft, card disruption, illusions)
- **Changeling Infiltrator**: Deceptive infiltration (identity theft, friendly fire, fear)
- **Oath-Bound Servants**: Binding enforcement (contract punishment, bodyguards, martyrdom)

Each unit offers distinct tactical approach while maintaining Wyrd identity: reality manipulation through bargains, trickery, and teleportation.

## DECK BUILDING EXAMPLES

### Example: Wyrd Scout Casket with Pixie Swarm

**Total Deck Construction**:
- 10 Universal Core (mandatory)
- 6 Wyrd Faction Core (mandatory)
- 6 Fae Blade (weapon, 1 slot)
- **Pixie Swarm** (2 slots)
- 2 Wyrd Tactics (choose 2)

**Total**: 24 cards, 1 Pixie Swarm support unit

**Playstyle**: Token generation engine. Pixies steal Wyrd Tokens, Casket spends them on teleportation/abilities. Maximum mobility and disruption.

### Example: Wyrd Assault Casket with Changeling Infiltrator

**Total Deck Construction**:
- 10 Universal Core
- 6 Wyrd Faction Core
- 6 Rapier (weapon, 1 slot)
- **Changeling Infiltrator** (2 slots)
- 2 Wyrd Tactics

**Total**: 24 cards, 1 Changeling Infiltrator

**Playstyle**: Infiltration chaos. Changeling infiltrates, causes friendly fire. Casket supports with teleportation strikes. Enemies never know who's real.

### Example: Wyrd Heavy Casket with Oath-Bound Servants

**Total Deck Construction**:
- 10 Universal Core
- 6 Wyrd Faction Core
- **Oath-Bound Servants** (3 slots)

**Total**: 18 cards, 1 Oath-Bound Servants

**Playstyle**: Contract enforcement. Servants protect Casket, punish oathbreakers. Casket creates Bargain Debts, Servants exploit them. Defensive powerhouse.

- Enemies overwhelmed by illusions and disguises

### Oath-Binding Contract + Oath-Bound Servants
- Casket curses enemies with Oathbreaker status via contracts
