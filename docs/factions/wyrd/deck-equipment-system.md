## WYRD FACTION CORE (6 Cards - Mandatory)

These 6 cards define Wyrd Conclave identity and cannot be removed or smelted.

### 1. REALITY BARGAIN (Token Generation)
**Type**: Gambit (Bargain)
**SP Cost**: 0
**Effect**: Offer an enemy a bargain: "Take 2 damage now, or I gain 2 Wyrd Tokens." Enemy chooses. If they refuse damage (you gain tokens), place "Bargain Debt" status on them.
**Keywords**: Gambit, Bargain, Token Generation
**Flavor**: *"Choice is an illusion. Both paths lead to my victory."*

**DESIGN NOTE**: This is the primary Wyrd token generator. Enemies must choose between immediate pain or empowering the Fae player.

### 2. MIRROR STEP (Teleportation)
**Type**: Movement (Special)
**SP Cost**: 1 Wyrd Token

### 4. WHAT-IF PARADOX (Reactive Defense)
**Type**: Reactive (Reality Manipulation)
**SP Cost**: 2 Wyrd Tokens
**Range**: Self
**Effect**: When you would take damage, declare a "What-If" alternate outcome (e.g., "What if that attack missed?" or "What if I was 2 hexes left?"). Roll 1d6:
- **1-2**: What-If fails, take double damage
- **3-4**: What-If partial, take half damage (round up)
- **5-6**: What-If succeeds, negate all damage

**Keywords**: Reactive, Defense, Gamble, Reality
**Flavor**: *"Reality is negotiable."*

**DESIGN NOTE**: High-risk, high-reward defense. Can completely negate damage OR make it worse.

**Type**: Utility (Curse)
**SP Cost**: 3
**Range**: 4 hexes

**Flavor**: *"Choose wisely. Both options disappoint you."*

---

### 6. FAIRY DUST (Passive - Disruptive)
**Type**: Passive Ability
**SP Cost**: N/A
**Effect**: At the start of each round, choose 1 enemy within 5 hexes. That enemy's hand is shuffled back into their deck, then they draw the same number of cards (random draw). Once per round.

---

### TACTIC 2: STOLEN FACES

**Range**: 3 hexes

---

## FACTION STRENGTHS

- **Unpredictability**: Teleportation + What-If Paradox = impossible to pin down
- **Versatility**: Stolen Reflection allows adaptation to any situation
- **Control**: Oath-Binding + Fairy Dust disrupts enemy plans
- **Psychological Warfare**: Stolen Faces + illusions create confusion
- **Scaling Power**: Wyrd Tokens accumulate over battle, grow stronger

---

## FACTION WEAKNESSES

- **Token Dependency**: Weak early game if can't generate Wyrd Tokens
- **High RNG**: What-If Paradox can backfire spectacularly (double damage)
- **Complex Resource Management**: Tracking tokens, stolen abilities, curses, bargains
- **Fragile Without Tokens**: Low innate defense, relies on teleportation to survive
- **Unreliable**: High skill ceiling, punishing for new players

---

## TACTICAL TIPS

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
- Use Reality Bargain immediately (force enemy choice for tokens)
- Mirror Step to reflective terrain (+1 token bonus)
- Don't spend tokens yet—bank to 4-6 tokens before using abilities
- Position near enemies for Mirror Step teleport options

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
- Use Stolen Reflection to copy enemy's best ability
- Spam Oath-Binding Contract to curse multiple enemies
- Mirror Step aggressively (teleport behind for flanking)
- What-If Paradox when threatened (gamble for defense)
- Track which enemies have Oathbreaker status (priority targets)

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
- Trickster's Gambit if token-starved (+3 tokens)
- Use Broken Vow on cursed enemies (8-12 damage finisher)
- Stolen Reflection should have 3 copied abilities (maximum versatility)
- Eternal Contract on final boss (permanent campaign advantage)
- What-If Paradox freely (10 tokens banked, spend liberally)

---

## COUNTER-PLAY (How to Beat Wyrd)

- **Deny Choices**: Always refuse bargains (take immediate damage instead of empowering them)
- **Spread Damage**: Don't kill Fae units (they generate tokens on reflective kills)
- **Destroy Primary Weapon Early**: Fae Blade is their best damage source
- **Area Denial**: Cover reflective terrain (water, ice) to deny Mirror Step bonuses
- **Target Their Tokens**: Force them to spend tokens defensively (What-If Paradox)
- **Ignore Illusions**: Illusion Slash duplicates don't actually hurt you (distraction only)

---

## CAMPAIGN PROGRESSION

### Starting Loadout (Mission 1)
- Weapon: Dagger (3 Scrap to craft) — cheap, fast attacks
- Offhand: Buckler Shield (2 Scrap to craft)
- Accessory: None (can't afford yet)
- **Total: 5 Scrap investment**

### Mid-Campaign (Mission 5-10)
- Upgrade to Fae Blade (8 Scrap, faction-exclusive)
- Add Mirror Shield (6 Scrap, faction-exclusive)
- Add Bargain Sigil (5 Scrap, faction-exclusive)

### Late-Campaign (Mission 15+)
- Acquire looted cross-faction equipment (Dwarven Warhammer for armor-pierce)
- Upgrade to Heavy or Fortress Casket (more accessory slots)
- Stack multiple Bargain Sigils for token-generation overdrive

## VERSION 3.0 OPTIONAL RULES

### Wyrd Interactions with Taint Exploitation

**Taint Philosophy**: Wyrd Conclave **exploits Taint as bargaining chip**. They thrive in Void-tainted zones.

**Faction Bonuses**:
- **Fae Physiology**: Wyrd pilots gain Taint at **half rate** (round up) from all sources
- **Void Affinity**: Wyrd can spend **enemy Taint** at 1-for-1 ratio (instead of 2-for-1)
- **Bargain Corruption**: Wyrd can offer Taint as payment in Reality Bargain ("Take 2 Taint OR I gain 3 Wyrd Tokens")

**Wyrd-Specific Taint Cards** (if using Taint Exploitation):
- **Reality Bargain**: Now offers "Take 2 damage, take 2 Taint, OR I gain 2 Wyrd Tokens" (three choices)
- **Fae Immunity**: Corruption threshold is **12 Taint** instead of 10 (Fae resist corruption longer)
- **Taint Theft**: Spend 3 Wyrd Tokens to steal 2 Taint from enemy and gain 2 SP

**Taint Trickster Build**:
1. Operate safely at 8-10 Taint (no corruption risk)
2. Spend enemy Taint aggressively (force rerolls, cancel cards)
3. Offer Taint in bargains ("Take 3 Taint OR skip your turn")
4. Use Taint Theft to weaponize enemy corruption

**Strategic Use**: Wyrd thrives in Void-heavy environments. Turn enemy Taint into resources. Use Taint as psychological weapon in bargains.

---

### Wyrd Pilot Grit System

**Starting Grit**: **0** (Standard)
- Wyrd pilots start at Grit 0 (base human level)
- However, they gain Grit **faster** than other factions

**Grit Progression**:
- Mission 5: Grit 1 (standard progression)
- Mission 10: Grit 2 (faster than normal)
- Mission 15: Grit 3 (faster than normal)
- Alternate: Win a "Fae Bargain" gamble (high-stakes bet) → immediate Grit +1

**Grit Check Example** (Wyrd Pilot, Grit 1):
```
Trigger: Capsule Breach (Pilot Wound)
Roll: 1d6 + 1 Grit = 4
Result: Shrug It Off (Minor Injury becomes No Effect)
Outcome: Wyrd pilot smirks, "That tickled."
```

**Thematic Fit**: Wyrd pilots are tricksters who gamble with death. They gain Grit through audacity and luck rather than training.

**END OF DOCUMENT**

*"Everything has a price. Everyone has a choice. I profit from both."*
