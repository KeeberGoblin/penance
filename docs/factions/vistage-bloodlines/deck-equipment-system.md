## Design Philosophy

The Vestige Bloodlines embody hereditary evolution through suffering. Every card reflects their philosophy:

- **Bloodline Identity**: Each pilot chooses a primary bloodline (Fenmar, Urtok, Vexis, Corvath, Serrak)
- **Biomass Economy**: Kill to harvest resources, trigger transformations
- **Pack Tactics**: Power scales with nearby Vestige allies
- **Bloodline Synergies**: Unique bonuses based on your chosen bloodline
- **Genetic Legacy**: Mutations passed through generations, growing stronger or more unstable

## TACTICAL GUIDELINES

### Bloodline Selection
- **Choose based on playstyle:** Fenmar (teamwork), Urtok (tank), Vexis (adaptability), Corvath (mobility), Serrak (control)
- **Team composition:** All-Fenmar team is strongest (pack synergies), but mixed bloodlines offer versatility
- **Bloodline-specific cards:** Some cards require matching primary bloodline (marked with "Requires: [Bloodline]")

### Biomass Economy
- **Generation:** Vestige Heritage (2 Biomass per kill, +1 if prey type matches), Devouring Maw (3 on kill)
- **Spending:** Bloodline Shift (2), Adaptive Evolution (1), Carapace Molt (2), Hibernation Trance (4)
- **Bloodline efficiency:** Fenmar generates more through pack kills, Urtok spends more on defense, Vexis cycles fastest
- **Optimal banking:** Keep 2-4 Biomass for emergency Bloodline Shift or Adaptive Evolution

### Pack Coordination (Fenmar-Specific)
- **Pure Fenmar pack:** +3 damage per attack (Pack Instinct bonus)
- **Alpha's Command:** Use every turn when 2+ Fenmar allies present (+2 movement for wolves)
- **Howl of Remembrance:** Rally scattered wolves, draw cards for each (resource engine)
- **Moonlit Fury:** Use when enemies grouped (mobile hunt-and-strike)

### Survival Tactics (Urtok-Specific)
- **Bloodline Shift (Urtok):** +3 Defense + regenerate when hit (tank form)
- **Hibernation Trance:** Save for 8 cards or fewer (resurrect with 6 cards, +2 Defense permanently)
- **Adaptive Evolution:** Farm damage intentionally (each hit = +1 permanent damage)
- **Regenerative Flesh:** Combine with Hibernation for massive healing (6 + 2-3 cards)

### Mutation Management (Vexis-Specific)
- **Carapace Molt:** Use reactively against 5+ damage attacks (negate + heal 3)
- **Bloodline Shift (Vexis):** +2 Defense + molt reaction once per round
- **Adaptive Evolution:** Use for controlled power spikes (choose mutation timing)
- **Reactive Scales:** Layer defenses (reduce 2-3 damage per attack)

### Hit-and-Run (Corvath-Specific)
- **Omen's Flight:** Glide 4 hexes, ignore terrain, draw 2 cards (mobility + card advantage)
- **Bloodline Shift (Corvath):** +3 movement + gliding (never get caught)
- **Predator's Mark:** Mark before engaging, kite while dealing +2 damage
- **Tracking Scent:** Draw 3 cards if Prey marked (resource engine while hunting)

### Poison Control (Serrak-Specific)
- **Serpent's Coil:** Immobilize + poison (lock down priority targets)
- **Bloodline Shift (Serrak):** ALL attacks poison (2 damage next turn = 100% uptime)
- **Venomous Spit:** Ranged poison (2 immediate + 2 delayed = 4 total)
- **Scent of Blood:** Execute poisoned enemies at 15 HP or fewer

## FACTION RELATIONSHIPS

| Faction | Relationship | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Church of Absolution** | -3 War | Church executes Vestige on sight (Taint corruption = sin) |
| **Verdant Covenant (Elves)** | -1 Distrustful | Elves pity Vestige but can't/won't help (view mutations as "unnatural") |
| **Forge-Guilds (Dwarves)** | 0 Neutral | Dwarves tolerate Vestige if they pay well (pragmatic trade, no emotion) |
| **The Exchange** | +1 Friendly | Exchange deals with anyone who has coin (neutrally amoral) |
| **The Ossuarium** | 0 Neutral | Ossuarium study Vestige mutations (offer dubious "cures" for souls) |
| **The Wyrd Conclave (Fae)** | -2 Hostile | Fae find Vestige "boring" (already cursed, nothing to bargain) |
| **Nomad Collective** | -1 Distrustful | Nomads fear Vestige (superstitious, believe mutations are contagious) |
| **Crucible Packs** | 0 Neutral | Crucible respect Vestige fighting spirit but pity their "dishonor" (unwilling curse) |
| **Emergent Syndicate** | -2 Hostile | Syndicate views Vestige as "failed prototypes" (random mutations vs scientific evolution) |

---

## DESIGN NOTES

### Balance Considerations
- **Biomass Economy**: Powerful but requires kills (weak if denied)
- **Bloodline Dependency**: Many cards require specific bloodlines (limits deck flexibility)
- **Pack Scaling**: Strongest with Vestige allies (weaker in mixed-faction teams)
- **Mutation Stacking**: Infinite scaling potential but slow ramp

### Unique Mechanics
- **Bloodline Shift**: 5 unique transformations (unprecedented variety)
- **Pack Instinct**: Scales with Vestige-specific allies (faction-locked synergy)
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Permanent damage scaling (turns defense into offense)
- **Bloodline Bonus**: Prey type matching (strategic target selection)

### Counterplay
- **Against Vestige**: Deny first kill, isolate pack members, anti-synergy tech, area denial
- **Vestige Counters**: Church (Righteous Wrath ignores Defense), Dwarves (Stone Endurance outlasts), Elves (Root Bind prevents Corvath escapes)

---

## CAMPAIGN INTEGRATION

### Early Campaign Hooks

- **Quest**: "Bloodline Truce" - Mediate peace between feuding Urtok and Serrak bloodlines

### Late Campaign Endgame
- **Cure Quest**: Find genetic stabilization method (Elven Worldheart sap? Ossuarium soul-binding? Dwarven runecraft?)
- **Extinction Acceptance**: Grendok's philosophy wins—Vestige peacefully fade into history
- **Syndicate Merger**: Sella Vexis leads Vestige into Emergent Syndicate (controlled evolution)
