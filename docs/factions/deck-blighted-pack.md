## TACTICAL GUIDELINES

### Biomass Economy
- **First kill is critical**: Biomass Harvest triggers resource engine
- **Prioritize squishy targets**: Early kills snowball advantage
- **Spend strategically**: Save Biomass for key mutations or emergency healing
- **Cannibalistic Feast**: Park on corpse markers for bonus Biomass

### Pack Positioning
- **Flanking is king**: Pack Tactics rewards surrounding enemies
- **Stay grouped**: Alpha's Command buffs require proximity
- **Coordinate focus fire**: Multiple Blighted on one target = massive damage
- **Howl of the Pack**: Rally scattered allies instantly

### Mutation Management
- **Random vs Controlled**: Chimeric Shift is cheap but random, Forced Mutation is expensive but precise
- **Stacking mutations**: Multiple mutations stack (Scales + Wings + Venom = tanky mobile poisoner)
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Take damage intentionally to farm permanent buffs
- **Mutation Cascade**: Spend Biomass before attacks for bonus damage

### Aggression Timing
- **Early game**: Conservative, focus on first kill
- **Mid game**: Aggressive with Biomass reserves
- **Late game**: Overwhelming with mutation stacks
- **Feral Rage**: Only use when you can afford to not defend
