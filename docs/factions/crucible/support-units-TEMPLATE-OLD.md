## CRUCIBLE SUPPORT UNITS OVERVIEW (DRAFT)

**Starting Units**:
1. Honor Guard - Defensive duelist
2. Forge Apprentice - Support/buffer
3. Tribal Hunter - Scout/skirmisher

**Unlockable Units**:
4. Duelist Champion - Elite 1v1 fighter
5. Forge Master - Tactical commander
6. Ancestral Spirit - Legendary ghost warrior

**Design Philosophy**: Crucible units should emphasize honor duels, forge tokens, and ancestral weapons. Units should feel like tribal warriors with a code.

## DESIGN NOTES

**Status**: This file is a placeholder template. Full support units design requires:

1. **Honor System**: How do support units interact with Honor Duels?
2. **Forge Tokens**: Do units generate/spend Forge tokens?
3. **Ancestral Weapons**: Do support units have hereditary equipment?
4. **Coward's Mark**: What happens if support unit refuses duel?

**Recommended Approach**: Use [Vestige Bloodlines support-units.md](../vestige-bloodlines/support-units.md) and [Exchange support-units.md](../exchange/support-units.md) as templates.

**Faction Identity to Preserve**:
- Honor-based combat
- Forge/fire worship
- Tribal pack structure
- Ancestral weapons/legacy

**"Honor is steel. Steel is honor. We are unbreakable."**
