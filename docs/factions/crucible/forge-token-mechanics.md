## Forge Token Mechanics

### What Are Forge Tokens?

**In-Universe**:
- Glowing embers infused with volcanic energy
- Physical manifestation of "The First Forge's" blessing
- Collected from lava, fire, and intense combat
- Sacred to Crucible (used in rituals, forging, blessings)

**In-Game**:
- Separate resource from SP (Soul Points)
- Persist across turns (don't refresh like SP)
- Can be stockpiled indefinitely (no maximum)
- Individual resource (not pooled with allies, even in Crucible teams)

---

## Generating Forge Tokens

### Primary Generation: Living Forge (Passive)

**Effect**: At the start of your turn, if you are standing in Lava Terrain (or within 1 hex of fire), gain 1 Forge token. **Bonus:** Gain 2 Forge tokens instead if you are standing directly in lava.

**Why This Is Core**:
- Encourages aggressive positioning (stand in lava = pain but power)
- Rewards terrain control (create lava → generate tokens)
- Snowball mechanic (tokens → create more lava → more tokens)

**Optimal Play**:
- Always position in lava if possible (2 tokens/turn vs 1 token/turn)
- Take the 2 damage per turn from lava (worth it for double token generation)
- Use Volcanic Tremor or Lava Flask to create lava hexes (ensure token generation)

---

### Secondary Generation: Combat Cards

#### Honor Duel (2 SP, Gambit)
- **Effect**: Challenge enemy to 1v1. If you kill them, gain 3 Forge tokens + recover 3 cards
- **Best used when**: Facing stronger enemy (isolate them via duel)
- **Value**: 3 tokens + 3 cards = 6 value for winning duel

#### Volcanic Rage (Passive, expansion card)
- **Effect**: When you take 5+ damage in one attack, gain 1 Forge token
- **Best used when**: Facing heavy hitters (turn damage into resource)
- **Value**: Converts pain into power (defensive token generation)

#### Forge Call (2 SP, secondary equipment)
- **Effect**: Gain 2 Forge tokens immediately. Generate 1 Heat.
- **Best used when**: Need tokens fast (emergency acceleration)
- **Risk**: Generates Heat (don't spam)
- **Value**: 2 tokens for 2 SP + 1 Heat = fast injection

---

## Forge Token Generation Rate (Expected)

### Solo Crucible Pilot (Lava Positioning)

**Early Game (Turns 1-3)**:
- Living Forge: Standing in lava = 2 tokens/turn × 3 turns = 6 tokens
- Forge Call: +2 tokens (if used)
- **Total**: 6-8 Forge tokens by Turn 3

**Mid Game (Turns 4-6)**:
- Living Forge: 2 tokens/turn × 3 turns = 6 tokens
- Honor Duel victory: +3 tokens (1 kill)
- Volcanic Rage: +1-2 tokens (from taking damage)
- **Total**: 10-11 tokens by Turn 6

**Late Game (Turns 7+)**:
- Living Forge: 2 tokens/turn × 4 turns = 8 tokens
- Honor Duel victories: +6 tokens (2 kills)
- Volcanic Rage: +3-4 tokens
- **Total**: 17-18 tokens by Turn 10

---

### Solo Crucible Pilot (No Lava Positioning)

**Early Game (Turns 1-3)**:
- Living Forge: Standing near fire (1 hex away) = 1 token/turn × 3 turns = 3 tokens
- Forge Call: +2 tokens
- **Total**: 5 tokens by Turn 3 (half as much as lava positioning)

**Lesson**: **Always stand in lava when possible** (2x token generation)

---

### Team Crucible (4 Players, All Crucible)

**Early Game (Turns 1-3)**:
- All players stand in lava (each generates 2 tokens/turn)
- Team total: 4 players × 6 tokens = 24 tokens by Turn 3

**Mid Game (Turns 4-6)**:
- Team creates multiple lava zones (Volcanic Tremor, Lava Flask)
- Team total: 40-60 tokens

**Late Game (Turns 7+)**:
- Token saturation (everyone has 10+ tokens)
- Team total: 80+ tokens (resource abundance)

---

## Spending Forge Tokens

### Forge Cost Reference Table

| Action | Cost | Value | Best Used When |
|--------|------|-------|----------------|
| **Forge Blessing** | 1 | Reduce damage by 3 (or 5 in lava) | Taking moderate damage |
| **Volcanic Tremor** | 2 | 2 AoE damage, knockdown, create lava | Need terrain control |
| **Emberforged Strike** | 2 | +2 damage, set target on fire | Need burst damage |
| **Magma Veins** | 3 | Teleport to lava, draw 2 cards | Need mobility/cards |
| **Trial by Fire** | 3 | +3 damage, immune to fire, regen | Desperate situations |
| **Ancestral Iron** | 5 | Permanent +1 stat (cross-mission) | End of mission |
| **Eruption** | 5 | 5 AoE damage, create 3 lava hexes | Ultimate finisher |

---

## Forge Token Spending Priority

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish lava terrain

**Priority 1**: Volcanic Tremor (2 tokens)
- Reason: Create lava hex → enables Living Forge generation

**Priority 2**: Lava Flask (1 SP, no tokens but creates lava)
- Reason: Cheap terrain creation

**Don't Spend On**:
- Ancestral Iron (save for end of mission)
- Eruption (too expensive early, need 5 tokens)
- Trial by Fire (waste tokens for small benefit early)

---

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
**Goal**: Maximize pressure and token economy

**Priority 1**: Emberforged Strike (2 tokens)
- Reason: +2 damage + burn = finish wounded enemies

**Priority 2**: Magma Veins (3 tokens)
- Reason: Teleport for positioning, draw 2 cards for options

**Priority 3**: Forge Blessing (1 token)
- Reason: Cheap defense (reduce 3-5 damage reactively)

**Don't Spend On**:
- Eruption (save for late game finisher)

---

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
**Goal**: Close out game or survive to late

**Priority 1**: Eruption (5 tokens, once per mission)
- Reason: 5 AoE damage + 3 lava hexes = board wipe

**Priority 2**: Trial by Fire (3 tokens)
- Reason: +3 damage, immune to fire, regenerate = power spike

**Priority 3**: Ancestral Iron (5 tokens, end of mission)
- Reason: Permanent +1 stat (carries over to next mission)

**Spending Freedom**: By late game, should have 15+ tokens (can afford everything)

---

## Forge Token Banking Strategy

### Optimal Bank Amount

**Early Game**: Bank 2-4 tokens
- Need 2 for Volcanic Tremor (terrain control)
- Extra 1-2 for Forge Blessing (emergency defense)

**Mid Game**: Bank 4-6 tokens
- Need 3 for Magma Veins (mobility/escape)
- Extra 2 for Emberforged Strike (burst damage)

**Late Game**: Bank 8+ tokens
- Need 5 for Eruption (ultimate finisher)
- Extra 3 for Trial by Fire (power spike)

### Never Go Below 1 Token

**Why**: Forge Blessing costs 1 token (reduce 3-5 damage reactively)
- If you have 0 tokens, you're defenseless
- Always keep 1 token in reserve for emergency defense

**Exception**: All-in aggression (spend everything for final kill, accept risk)

---

## Lava Terrain Mechanics

### What Is Lava Terrain?

**Created By**:
- Volcanic Tremor (2 Forge tokens, creates 1 hex, lasts 3 turns)
- Lava Flask (1 SP, creates 1 hex, lasts 2 turns)
- Eruption (5 Forge tokens, creates 3 hexes, lasts 3 turns)
- Some scenarios have pre-placed lava (volcanic battlefields)

**Effects**:
- **Enemies**: Take 2 damage at start of their turn if standing in lava
- **Crucible**: Generate 2 Forge tokens/turn (via Living Forge) if standing in lava
- **Movement**: Costs +1 SP to enter lava hex (difficult terrain)
- **Duration**: Lava hexes disappear after listed duration (2-3 turns)

---

### Standing in Lava: Risk vs. Reward

**Risk**:
- Take 2 damage per turn standing in lava
- Over 5 turns = 10 damage total (significant)

**Reward**:
- Generate 2 Forge tokens per turn (double normal rate)
- Over 5 turns = 10 tokens total (worth 10+ damage in Emberforged Strikes)

**Math**:
- **Cost**: 10 HP (damage from lava)
- **Gain**: 10 tokens = 10+ damage dealt (via token spending)
- **Net**: Break-even or positive (if tokens spent efficiently)

**Optimal Strategy**: Stand in lava when healthy (can afford HP loss), avoid when low HP (can't tank damage)

---

### Lava Immunity Options

**Trial by Fire** (3 Forge tokens, gambit):
- Enter lava, take 3 damage immediately
- For 2 turns: immune to fire damage, +3 damage, regenerate 1 card/turn
- **Result**: Stand in lava without taking damage (negates lava downside)

**Forge-Matron Kerra (NPC unique)**:
- "Unburnt" passive: Immune to fire, lava heals 1 card/turn instead
- Not available to players (NPC-exclusive)

---

## Forge Token Mistakes to Avoid

### X Don't Stand Outside Lava

**Problem**: Living Forge generates 1 token/turn (near fire) vs 2 tokens/turn (in lava)
**Solution**: Take the 2 damage per turn, stand in lava (double token generation worth it)

### X Don't Hoard Tokens Early

**Problem**: Tokens don't generate value sitting unused
**Solution**: Spend 2 tokens on Volcanic Tremor by Turn 2-3 (create lava, start token engine)

### X Don't Waste Tokens on Forge Blessing When Healthy

**Problem**: Forge Blessing reduces 3-5 damage, but if you're at full HP, wasted value
**Solution**: Tank damage when healthy, save tokens for offense

### X Don't Forget Ancestral Iron at Mission End

**Problem**: Leftover tokens disappear (no carry-over between missions)
**Solution**: Always spend 5 tokens on Ancestral Iron at mission end (permanent upgrade)

### X Don't Use Eruption Too Early

**Problem**: Once per mission, wasted if used on small threat
**Solution**: Save Eruption for boss phase or grouped enemies (maximize AoE value)

## Advanced Forge Tactics

### Tactic 1: Lava Loop

**Setup**: Living Forge + Volcanic Tremor + Magma Veins

**Execution**:
1. Stand in lava (generate 2 tokens/turn via Living Forge)
2. Use Volcanic Tremor (spend 2 tokens, create new lava hex, knockdown enemies)
3. Teleport to new lava hex via Magma Veins (3 tokens, draw 2 cards)
4. **Result**: Constant lava positioning, infinite token generation, high mobility

**Value**: Self-sustaining token economy (tokens → create lava → more tokens)

---

### Tactic 2: Honor Duel Token Farm

**Setup**: Honor Duel + Coward's Brand

**Execution**:
1. Challenge strongest enemy with Honor Duel (2 SP)
2. If enemy accepts → 1v1, kill them, gain 3 tokens + 3 cards
3. If enemy refuses → mark them with Coward's Mark (+2 damage permanently)
4. Use Coward's Brand (2 SP, 6 damage + no defense) to execute marked enemy
5. **Result**: Either way, enemy dies and you profit

**Value**: 3 tokens + 3 cards from duel victory OR easy kill on marked coward

---

### Tactic 3: Trial by Fire Power Spike

**Setup**: Trial by Fire + Emberforged Strike + Pack Fury

**Execution**:
1. Use Trial by Fire (3 tokens, +3 damage, immune to fire, regen 1 card/turn)
2. Stand in lava (no damage taken, still generate 2 tokens/turn)
3. Use Pack Fury (2 SP, +3 damage if outnumbered)
4. Use Emberforged Strike (2 tokens, 5 damage → 7 damage + burn)
5. **Result**: 5 base + 2 (Emberforged) + 3 (Trial) + 3 (Pack Fury) = 13 damage + 2 burn = 15 total

**Value**: Massive burst damage while immune to lava (perfect combo)

---

### Tactic 4: Ancestral Iron Snowball

**Setup**: Ancestral Iron + multiple missions

**Execution**:
1. Mission 1: Forge Ancestral Weapon (+1 damage, 5 tokens)
2. Mission 2: Forge Ancestral Weapon (+1 damage, 5 tokens) [total +2 damage]
3. Mission 3: Forge Ancestral Weapon (+1 Defense, 5 tokens) [total +2 damage, +1 Defense]
4. **Result**: By Mission 3, permanently have +2 damage and +1 Defense (no SP cost)

**Value**: Compound scaling across campaign (late-game Crucible are gods)

## Forge Token Economy FAQs

**Q: Do Forge tokens carry over between missions?**  
A: No. Spend all tokens before mission ends (Ancestral Iron is best use).

**Q: Can allies steal my tokens?**  
A: No. Tokens are individual resource, not pooled.

**Q: Can I trade tokens with allies?**  
A: No. No trading mechanic.

**Q: What happens if I have 10+ tokens?**  
A: No maximum. Bank as many as you want (but diminishing returns, spend them).

**Q: Can enemies destroy my tokens?**  
A: No. Tokens can't be destroyed (only spent by you).

**Q: Does Living Forge trigger if ally creates lava?**  
A: Yes. ANY lava hex counts (even if ally created it).

**Q: Can I stand in lava indefinitely?**  
A: Yes, but take 2 damage/turn. Use Trial by Fire for immunity (2 turns).

**Q: Does lava damage trigger Volcanic Rage?**  
A: No. Volcanic Rage only triggers from attack damage (5+), not environmental damage.

**Q: Can I create lava in enemy-occupied hex?**  
A: No. Lava Flask and Volcanic Tremor target empty hexes.

**Q: Does Eruption's lava placement include center hex?**  
A: Yes. 3 random hexes within area (including center).
