## FACTION SYNERGIES

| Allied Faction | Synergy | Anti-Synergy |
|----------------|---------|--------------|
| **Church** | Honor Guard protects self-harming Church pilots | Compete for melee range |
| **Dwarves** | Both defensive, Shield Wall + Bulwark = fortress | Both slow, lack mobility |

| **Vestige** | Both pack-focused, Pack Tactics stack | None |
| **Emergent** | Tribal Hunter marks, Emergent swarm focuses | None |
| **Exchange** | Can hire Crucible mercenaries with Credits | None |
| **Nomads** | Both nomadic, mutual respect, Honor Guard + Nomad scouts = intelligence network | None |

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Identity: Honor Through Fire
- **Honor Code**: Duels are sacred, cowardice is unforgivable
- **Forge Worship**: Fire is holy, lava terrain empowers
- **Ancestral Legacy**: Weapons and warriors persist beyond death
- **Pack Structure**: Fight together, protect each other, honor lineage

### Gameplay Pattern
- **Forge Token Economy**: Generate tokens in lava, spend for powerful effects
- **Honor Duels**: Challenge enemies, punish cowards
- **Volcanic Terrain**: Create and control lava hexes
- **Ancestral Equipment**: Permanent upgrades across missions

### Counterplay
- **Refuse Duels**: Accept Coward's Mark, avoid 1v1 combat
- **Kill Token Generators**: Focus Forge Apprentice, Forge Master
- **Kiting**: Avoid melee range, use ranged attacks
- **AOE Damage**: Punish clustering around lava terrain
- **Destroy Lava Terrain**: Remove Forge token sources

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Targets**:
- Starter units: ~65% power of Casket (supportive, reliable)
- Unlockable units: ~75% power of Casket (specialized, powerful)
- Elite unit (Ancestral Spirit): ~85% power of Casket (legendary, game-changing)

**Core Fantasy**: "Honorable warriors who worship fire, forge legendary weapons, and never break oaths."

**Unique Mechanics**:
- **Honor Duel System**: Units can accept duels on behalf of Casket
- **Forge Token Sharing**: Units generate tokens for entire team
- **Ancestral Spirit**: Undying unit that returns after death
- **Coward's Mark Punishment**: Units specifically counter dishonorable enemies

**Next Steps**:
1. Playtest Honor Duel mechanics with support units
2. Balance Forge token generation (ensure not overpowered)
3. Test Ancestral Spirit survivability (50% damage reduction might be too strong)
4. Create visual reference cards for Tabletop Simulator

**"Fire conquers all. Honor binds us. Steel defines us."**
