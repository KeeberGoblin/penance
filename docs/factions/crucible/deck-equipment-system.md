## Design Philosophy

The Crucible Packs embody honor through fire. Every card reflects their philosophy:

- **Forge Token Economy**: Generate tokens in volcanic terrain, spend for powerful effects
- **Honor Duel System**: Challenge enemies to 1v1 combat with binding rules
- **Volcanic Terrain Control**: Thrive in lava, create fire zones
- **Ancestral Iron**: Equipment persists across missions (legacy gear)
- **Lineage Pride**: Caskets passed down through generations
- **Desperate Strength**: Stronger when outnumbered (underdog bonus)
- **Forge-Worship**: Fire is sacred (shamanic volcano deity religion)

---

## Historical Context: The Ashveil Exodus

### Pre-Sundering Origins

**The Forge-Clans** (Pre-Sundering volcanic territories):
- Mountain clans living near active volcanoes
- Metallurgy culture (forged legendary weapons in volcanic heat)
- Shamanistic religion (worshipped "The First Forge" volcano deity)
- Warrior society (honor duels to settle disputes)

---

### Year 0: The Sundering & Volcanic Awakening

**When Theslar activated the Engine**:
- Void energy destabilized tectonic plates
- Dormant volcanoes erupted across the world (hundreds simultaneously)
- **Ashveil Mountains**: Entire volcanic range exploded (Year 0, Day 2)
- Forge-Clans buried under ash and lava (estimated 50,000 dead)

**The Survivors**:
- ~5,000 Forge-Clan members survived (underground forges, lava tubes)
- Emerged from volcano ruins (Year 0, Day 30)
- Found homeland destroyed (everything buried under ash)
- **Named themselves**: "The Crucible Packs" (forged in fire, tempered by loss)

---

### Year 1-50: Nomadic Warrior Culture

**Early Survival**:
- Scavenged pre-Sundering forges (salvaged ancestral equipment)
- Migrated to new volcanic regions (followed active volcanoes)
- Established "Pack" system (family units 20-50 members)
- **Forge-Matrons** lead packs (eldest female smith, spiritual authority)

**Religious Evolution**:
- "The First Forge" deity survived Sundering (proves divinity)
- Volcanoes are holy sites (each eruption is divine message)
- Ash is sacred (ancestor's remains, used in rituals)
- **New belief**: Fire tests worth (trial by combat, forge trials)

---

### Year 100-437: The Packs Today

**Current Population**: ~12,000 Crucible Pack members
- 8 major packs (1,500 members each)
- Dozens of minor packs (100-500 members)
- Nomadic (follow volcanic activity, never settle permanently)

**Pack Structure**:
- **Forge-Matron**: Leader (eldest female smith, spiritual authority)
- **Ashen-King**: War leader (strongest male warrior, tactical command)
- **Emberforges**: Smiths (craft weapons, maintain ancestral iron)
- **Pack-Kin**: Warriors (hunters, duelists, defenders)

**Territory**: Volcanic badlands (anywhere with active volcanoes)
- Ashveil Desert (scorched wasteland, former homeland)
- Magma Veins (underground lava tube networks)
- The Burning Peaks (active volcano range)
