## Design Philosophy

The Crucible Packs embody honor through fire. Every card reflects their philosophy:

- **Forge Token Economy**: Generate tokens in volcanic terrain, spend for powerful effects
- **Honor Duel System**: Challenge enemies to 1v1 combat with binding rules
- **Volcanic Terrain Control**: Thrive in lava, create fire zones
- **Ancestral Iron**: Equipment persists across missions (legacy gear)
- **Lineage Pride**: Caskets passed down through generations
- **Desperate Strength**: Stronger when outnumbered (underdog bonus)
- **Forge-Worship**: Fire is sacred (shamanic volcano deity religion)

## Historical Context: The Ashveil Exodus

### Pre-Sundering Origins

**The Cinder Tribes** (Pre-Sundering volcanic territories):
- Goblinoid scavenger clans living in volcanic wastelands
- Explosive alchemy culture (harvested sulfur, obsidian, and cinders for crude bombs)
- Shamanistic fire worship (worshipped "The First Forge" volcano deity)
- Mob society (strength in numbers, overwhelming swarm tactics)

---

### Year 0: The Sundering & Volcanic Awakening

**When Theslar activated the Engine**:
- Void energy destabilized tectonic plates
- Dormant volcanoes erupted across the world (hundreds simultaneously)
- **Ashveil Caldera**: Entire volcanic basin exploded (Year 0, Day 2)
- Cinder Tribes caught in eruption (estimated 80,000 dead)

**The Survivors**:
- ~15,000 goblinoids survived (living in deep lava tubes, already adapted to volcanic heat)
- Emerged from volcano ruins (Year 0, Day 30)
- Found wasteland perfect for scavenging (ash, obsidian, sulfur everywhere)
- **Named themselves**: "The Crucible Packs" (tempered in fire, born from cinders)

---

### Year 1-50: Nomadic Scavenger Culture

**Early Survival**:
- Scavenged volcanic materials (obsidian, sulfur, cinders for explosives)
- Migrated to new volcanic regions (followed eruptions for fresh materials)
- Established "Pack" system (mob units 50-200 members, safety in numbers)
- **Ember-Bosses** lead packs (biggest, loudest goblin with most scars)

**Religious Evolution**:
- "The First Forge" deity survived Sundering (proves power)
- Volcanoes are holy sites (each eruption brings gifts: lava, ash, sulfur)
- Explosions are sacred (bigger boom = more blessed)
- **New belief**: Fire favors the bold (reckless bravery rewarded, cowardice punished)

---

### Year 100-437: The Packs Today

**Current Population**: ~25,000 Crucible Pack members (goblinoids breed fast)
- 12 major packs (2,000 members each)
- Hundreds of minor packs (50-300 members, constantly forming/disbanding)
- Nomadic (follow volcanic activity, scavenge obsidian and sulfur)

**Pack Structure**:
- **Ember-Boss**: Leader (biggest goblin, wins mob challenges by being loudest/toughest)
- **Boom-Shamans**: Alchemists (mix explosives, bless bombs, interpret volcanic omens)
- **Cinder-Scavs**: Gatherers (harvest sulfur, obsidian, scrap metal from ruins)
- **Pack-Mob**: Warriors (swarm tactics, suicide bombers, overwhelming numbers)

**Territory**: Volcanic badlands (anywhere with active volcanoes and scavenging)
- Ashveil Wastes (scorched scrap fields, former homeland)
- Sulfur Pits (toxic volcanic vents, goblinoid-only zones)
- The Burning Peaks (active volcano range, sacred sites)
