## Goblinoid Physical Characteristics

### Body Structure
- **Height:** 4-5 feet tall (short humanoids, roughly 1.2-1.5 meters)
- **Build:** Wiry, lean muscle definition visible through taut skin. NOT frail—compact strength. Sinew and tendon prominent. Athletic climber's physique.
- **Proportions:** Slightly longer arms relative to torso (climbing adaptation). Strong hands with thick fingers built for gripping hot metal.

### Skin & Texture
- **Color Range:** Ash-gray (#6e6e6e) to charcoal-black (#2b2b2b). Some individuals have gradient patterns (lighter gray on limbs, darker on torso).
- **Texture:** Thick, leathery skin with slight scaling (like burnt leather). Heat-resistant appearance—matte finish, non-reflective.
- **Scars:** Ritual burn scars common (from Forge Trials). Brands and ash tattoos marking Pack membership. Scar tissue appears lighter gray against dark skin.

### Facial Features
- **Eyes:** Reflective yellow (#FFD700) or volcanic orange (#FF6347). Cat-like vertical pupils with tapetum lucidum glow in darkness. Wide-set for peripheral vision.
- **Teeth:** Sharpened canines visible when mouth open. Slight underbite (bottom canines protrude). Carnivore dentition.
- **Ears:** Pointed upward (elf-like) but tattered/burned at tips from heat exposure. Pierced with metal rings and obsidian shards.
- **Nose:** Broad, flat (heat dissipation). Flared nostrils. Soot stains around nostrils from ash inhalation.
- **Hair:** Sparse, coarse black hair. Often singed short or shaved completely. Some grow hair in mohawks or braids decorated with ash beads. White-gray hair on elders (like Kerra the Unburnt).

### Hands & Extremities
- **Hands:** Calloused, scarred, burn-marked. Thick fingers adapted for gripping hot metal without gloves. Blackened fingernails from soot.
- **Feet:** Often bare or wearing minimal sandals (heat-resistant feet). Thick soles, cracked from walking on volcanic rock.

## Clothing & Armor Aesthetic

### Materials
- **Primary:** Scorched leather (dark brown-black), volcanic glass (obsidian fragments), heat-treated steel plates
- **Decoration:** Ash-dyed cloth wraps (charcoal gray), copper wire bindings, bone ornaments from ancestors, volcanic rock beads

### Armor Style
- **Heavy Armor (Warriors/Pilots):**
  - Layered steel plates blackened from forge smoke
  - Asymmetrical pauldrons (one shoulder larger for shield-bearing)
  - Riveted construction with visible copper/bronze rivets (oxidized green)
  - Minimal padding (goblinoids tolerate heat, don't need insulation)
  - Open joints/gaps to vent heat (not fully sealed armor)
  - Helmets with T-shaped visors or open-face designs showing yellow eyes

- **Light Armor (Scouts/Smiths):**
  - Leather wraps bound with metal wire
  - Chest harness with tool loops (tongs, hammers visible)
  - Bare arms showing scarred skin and burn marks
  - Utility belts with pouches of volcanic ash (ritual use)

### Iconic Elements
- **Forge-Matron Kerra:** Long flowing robes (ash-gray) with ceremonial branding irons hanging from belt. White-gray hair braided with obsidian shards. Ritual scars covering arms. Carries ancestral hammer (oversized, glowing with heat).

- **Ashen-King Torrak:** Spiked pauldrons (intimidation), dual-wielding volcanic blades (curved swords with lava-glow edges). Bare-chested to show duel scars (47 scars, one per victory). War paint (ash mixed with blood) across face.

### Weapons
- **Melee:** Obsidian-edged axes, volcanic hammers (glowing red from residual heat), curved swords with serrated edges
- **Ranged:** Sling-staffs launching molten rock, crude crossbows with bone bolts
- **Shields:** Circular steel shields with volcanic rock reinforcement, emblazoned with Pack symbols (flame motifs)

## Environmental Context

### Typical Settings
- **Volcanic Caldera:** Background shows lava flows, ash clouds, glowing fissures
- **Underground Forges:** Anvils carved from volcanic rock, molten metal rivers, hanging chains and gears
- **Wasteland Camps:** Tents made from scorched hide, bonfire centerpiece, volcanic peaks in distance

### Lighting Scenarios
- **Forge Glow:** Character lit from below by lava pool (orange rim light, deep shadows on face)
- **Ash Storm:** Backlit silhouette with embers swirling around figure
- **Duel Scene:** Two warriors circling each other, lava pit between them casting flickering light

## Style References

**Art Style:** Grimdark fantasy realism (similar to Warhammer 40k, Dark Souls, Diablo)

**Inspirations:**
- Goblin redesigns (avoid cute/comical—emphasize survivalist mutation)
- Volcanic environments (Iceland lava fields, Hawaiian volcanic parks)
- Metalworking photography (blacksmiths at work, molten steel)
- Post-apocalyptic tribal aesthetics (Mad Max meets fantasy forge-clans)

**Avoid:**
- Cartoonish proportions (keep realistic anatomy)
- Bright saturated colors (muted palette only)
- Clean/polished armor (everything should look scorched, used, battle-worn)
- Generic orc/goblin tropes (this is Void-mutated humanity, not Tolkien greenskins)

---

## Negative Prompts (What NOT to Include)

- Green skin (NOT traditional goblins—ash-gray/charcoal only)
- Large noses (avoid caricature features)
- Comical expressions (serious/grim only)
- Bright environments (always volcanic/dark settings)
- Clean armor (weathered/scorched only)
- Fantasy medieval castles (volcanic wasteland only)

## Technical Specifications for AI Generation

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Aspect Ratio:** 2:3 (portrait orientation) or 16:9 (landscape faction banner)
- **Resolution:** 1024x1536 minimum for portrait quality
- **Detail Level:** High (emphasize skin texture, scars, armor weathering)
- **Lighting:** Dramatic (high contrast, rim lighting, volcanic glow)

**Example Master Prompt (Midjourney/DALL-E):**

```
A goblinoid Forge-Matron from the Crucible Packs faction, standing before a volcanic altar with molten lava flowing in the background. She has ash-gray leathery skin, glowing yellow cat-like eyes, and white-gray hair braided with obsidian shards. Her arms are covered in ritual burn scars that glow faintly orange. She wears flowing charcoal-gray robes and holds an oversized ceremonial hammer. The scene is lit from below by lava glow, casting dramatic shadows across her face. Embers and ash particles float in the air. Grimdark fantasy realism, post-apocalyptic tribal aesthetic, detailed character portrait, dark fantasy, volcanic wasteland setting. --ar 2:3 --style raw --v 6

## Final Notes

**Faction Identity Summary:** The Crucible Packs are NOT traditional fantasy goblins. They are **Void-mutated humans** who survived volcanic catastrophe and adapted to become shorter, heat-resistant, ash-skinned survivors. Their culture revolves around fire-worship, honor duels, and blacksmithing. Every visual element should communicate: **"Forged in fire, tempered by loss, mutated by the Void."**

When generating portraits, prioritize:
1. **Survivalist realism** (weathered, scarred, battle-hardened)
2. **Volcanic environment integration** (lava glow, ash, embers)
3. **Distinct goblinoid features** (4-5 feet tall, yellow eyes, ash-gray skin)
4. **Cultural elements** (ancestral weapons, ritual scars, Pack symbols)

The Crucible Packs should feel dangerous, honorable, and tragically beautiful—survivors who embrace their mutation as divine blessing rather than curse.
