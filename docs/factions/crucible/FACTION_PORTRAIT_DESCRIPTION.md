## Final Notes for AI Generation

**Faction Identity in Manuscript Style:**

The Crucible Packs are Void-mutated goblinoid blacksmiths who worship fire as divine. The illuminated manuscript portrait should communicate:

1. **Fire as Sacred:** Flames, forges, and volcanic imagery dominate
2. **Honor through Trial:** Burn scars are badges of pride, not wounds
3. **Smithing Culture:** Tools (hammers, anvils, tongs) are religious symbols
4. **Goblinoid Physique:** Shortened stature (4-5 feet), ash-gray skin, yellow eyes
5. **Latin Motto:** "IGNIS VINCIT OMNIA" (Fire Conquers All)

The art should feel like a **medieval religious icon depicting fire-worshipping forge-priests** rather than realistic character art. Think Byzantine saint portraits meets industrial blacksmith symbolism.
