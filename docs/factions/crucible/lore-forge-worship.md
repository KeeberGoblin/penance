## The First Forge (Deity)

### What Is the First Forge?

**Crucible Belief**:
- Primordial deity born from first volcanic eruption (before humanity)
- Embodiment of fire, transformation, and strength
- **Not a god of mercy** (god of testing, trials, survival)
- Speaks through volcanoes (eruptions are divine messages)

**Physical Form**:
- No fixed form (manifests as lava, ash, volcanic smoke)
- Sometimes appears as humanoid figure made of molten rock
- Voice sounds like grinding stone and bubbling magma
- **Eyes**: Glowing embers (see into souls, judge worth)

---

### The First Forge's Teachings

**Core Tenets**:

1. **"Fire Tests All"** - Trials by fire reveal true worth
2. **"Strength Endures"** - Only the strong survive, weakness is death
3. **"Honor Binds"** - Oaths sworn before the Forge are sacred
4. **"Ash Remembers"** - Ancestors live in ash, honor their memory
5. **"Forge Your Fate"** - Destiny is forged, not given

---

### The First Forge's Judgment

**How to Earn Blessing**:
- Survive fire trials (stand in lava, prove endurance)
- Win honor duels (strength through combat)
- Forge ancestral weapons (create legacy)
- Honor ancestors (remember the dead)
- Never flee battle (cowardice is unforgivable sin)

**How to Earn Curse**:
- Refuse honor duel (cowardice = ultimate sin)
- Break oaths (lying before the Forge)
- Dishonor ancestors (destroy ancestral weapons)
- Flee battle (survival without honor = worthless)
- Betray Pack (individual > collective = heresy)

## First Forge Mythology

### Creation Myth

**In the Beginning**:
- World was cold, dark, dead (no fire)
- First Forge ignited (first volcanic eruption)
- Fire spread across world (volcanism created life)
- **Humanity born from ash** (First Forge's gift)

**The Betrayal**:
- Humanity forgot First Forge (turned to other gods)
- First Forge withdrew (volcanoes went dormant)
- World grew cold again (ice age)

**The Reconciliation**:
- Forge-Clans rediscovered volcano worship (pre-Sundering)
- First Forge returned (volcanoes reawakened)
- **Pact sworn**: Crucible will never forget, First Forge will never abandon

---

### Prophecy of the Final Forge

**Ancient Prophecy** (source: first Forge-Matron, Year 0):
> "When the mountains fall silent and the ash turns to dust, the First Forge will rise. All who bear its mark shall forge anew. All who flee shall burn."

**Interpretation** (debated among Crucible):

**Apocalyptic View** (Torrak's interpretation):
- Final Forge = end times (all volcanoes erupt simultaneously)
- World consumed by fire (only Crucible survive)
- **Crucible inherit world** (forge new civilization from ashes)

**Renewal View** (Kerra's interpretation):
- Final Forge = spiritual renewal (not literal eruption)
- Crucible must unite (all Packs become one)
- **Forge new destiny** (metaphorical forging, not destruction)

**Current Year (437)**: No signs of Final Forge (prophecy unfulfilled... yet)

---

## Forge Worship vs. Other Religions

### vs. Church of Absolution

**Church View**: Crucible are pagans (volcano worship = heresy)  
**Crucible View**: Church worships false god (corpse-god has no fire)  
**Relationship**: Hostile (Church wants to "convert" Crucible, Crucible refuse)

**Notable Conflict (Year 400)**: Church sent missionaries to Crucible
- Missionaries tried to extinguish sacred forge-fires (destroy idols)
- Crucible burned missionaries alive (heresy punishment)
- **Result**: Church declared Crucible "irredeemable heathens"

---

### vs. Verdant Covenant (Elves)

**Elven View**: Fire destroys nature (Crucible are environmental terrorists)  
**Crucible View**: Fire purifies nature (ash fertilizes soil, renewal)  
**Relationship**: Hostile (Elves oppose Crucible forest-burning for forges)

**Notable Conflict (Year 420)**: Crucible burned elven forest for forge fuel
- Elves retaliated (Root Bind attacks on Crucible camps)
- Crucible responded (burned more forests in revenge)
- **Current status**: Cold war (no active combat, mutual distrust)

---

### vs. The Ossuarium

**Ossuarium View**: Fire destroys corpses (prevents undeath)  
**Crucible View**: Fire honors dead (ash = proper memorial)  
**Relationship**: Neutral (philosophical difference, but no conflict)

**Interesting Note**: Some Crucible cremate their dead, then give ashes to Ossuarium
- Ossuarium use ashes in rituals (bone ash has necromantic properties)
- **Trade relationship**: Crucible provide ash, Ossuarium provide Soulstones

---

## Forge Worship in Campaign

### Quest: Trial by Fire

**Scenario**: Forge-Matron Kerra offers player Forge Trial

**Trial**:
1. Stand in lava for 30 seconds (take 2 damage per turn × 3 turns = 6 damage total)
2. **Success**: Kerra grants blessing (start next mission with 3 Forge tokens)
3. **Failure**: Take too much damage, flee trial (Coward's Mark applied)

**Player Choice**:
- Accept trial (prove strength, gain blessing)
- Refuse trial (avoid damage, but lose Crucible respect)

---

### Quest: The Silent Volcano

**Scenario**: Volcano hasn't erupted in 5 years (ominous silence)

**Crucible Concern**: First Forge is displeased (or dormant, or dead?)

**Player Mission**: Investigate volcano (enter caldera, discover why no eruptions)

**Possible Outcomes**:
1. **Void corruption**: Void energy blocking magma flow (clear corruption → volcano erupts)
2. **Natural blockage**: Lava tube collapsed (engineer solution → volcano erupts)
3. **First Forge abandoned**: Deity truly gone (devastating to Crucible faith)

**Reward**: If volcano erupts, Crucible grant player Ancestral Weapon (free +1 stat upgrade)

---

### Quest: The Heretic's Pyre

**Scenario**: Crucible warrior refuses honor duel (gains Coward's Mark)

**Crucible Judgment**: Warrior must be executed (heresy punishment)

**Player Choice**:
1. **Execute warrior**: Uphold Crucible law (gain Crucible favor)
2. **Spare warrior**: Defy Crucible law (warrior becomes ally, Crucible become enemies)
3. **Challenge Crucible**: Duel Ashen-King Torrak for warrior's life (win = spare warrior, lose = both die)

**Moral Dilemma**: Is honor more important than life?

---

### Quest: Reclaim Ashveil

**Scenario**: Ashveil Volcano (ancestral homeland) now Void-corrupted

**Crucible Goal**: Purify homeland, reclaim sacred site

**Player Mission**: Lead Crucible army into Void-corrupted ruins (multi-mission campaign arc)

**Phases**:
1. **Scouting**: Map Void corruption (identify sources)
2. **Assault**: Fight through Abominations (clear path to volcano)
3. **Purification**: Use Crucible ritual fire to cleanse Void (massive battle)
4. **Reclamation**: Rebuild forge-temple at volcano summit

**Reward**: If successful, Crucible grant player "Forge-Friend" title (honorary Pack member, access to all Crucible services, +1 Ancestral Weapon)

**Q: What happens if volcano goes dormant permanently?**  
A: Crucible believe First Forge abandoned them (apocalyptic crisis). Mass pilgrimage to other volcanoes.

**Q: Can Crucible use magic/technology to create fake eruptions?**

**Q: Do Crucible pray before battles?**  
A: Yes. Brief prayer: "First Forge, test me. I do not fear the flame."

**Q: Can Crucible refuse Forge Trial at age 16?**  
A: No. Refusal = exile (never accepted as full Pack member).

**Q: What if youth dies during Forge Trial?**  
A: Honorable death (First Forge's judgment). Youth's ashes honored, family proud.

**Q: Can Crucible convert to other religions?**  
A: Technically yes, but results in exile (betraying First Forge = unforgivable).
