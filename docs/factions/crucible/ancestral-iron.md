## Ancestral Iron Mechanics

### What Is Ancestral Iron?

**In-Universe**:
- Weapons and armor forged from meteorite iron (pre-Sundering metal)
- Passed down through Crucible lineages (grandfather → father → child)
- Each piece has history (names, deeds, legends)
- Spiritually significant (ancestors' spirits inhabit gear)

**In-Game**:
- Permanent stat upgrades that persist across missions
- Forged at end of mission (spend 5 Forge tokens)
- Choose one bonus: +1 damage, +1 Defense, or +1 movement
- **Maximum 3 Ancestral Weapons** (prevent infinite scaling)

## Forging Ancestral Iron

### Ancestral Iron Card (Passive)

**Effect**: At the end of each mission, you may spend 5 Forge tokens to forge 1 Ancestral Weapon. Choose: +1 damage permanently to all attacks, OR +1 Defense permanently, OR +1 movement permanently. Ancestral Weapons persist across missions (permanent upgrades). Can have up to 3 Ancestral Weapons total.

**Timing**: End of mission (after final combat, before returning to base)

**Process**:
1. Check Forge token count (need 5 tokens)
2. Choose bonus (+1 damage, +1 Defense, or +1 movement)
3. Forge Ancestral Weapon (spend 5 tokens)
4. **Result**: Permanent stat upgrade (applies to all future missions)

---

### Forging Limits

**Maximum Ancestral Weapons**: 3 total

**Why Limit Exists**:
- Prevents infinite scaling (+10 damage would break game)
- Maintains balance (Crucible strong but not invincible)
- Thematic (only so many ancestral pieces can be carried)

**What Happens at 3 Weapons**:
- Cannot forge more Ancestral Weapons (option grayed out)
- Leftover Forge tokens wasted (spend on other things)
- **Exception**: If weapon is "lost" (destroyed in story), can forge replacement

---

## Ancestral Weapon Options

### Option 1: Ancestral Blade (+1 Damage)

**Effect**: +1 damage to ALL attacks permanently

**Best For**:
- Aggressive duelists (Honor Duel builds)
- High-attack-rate builds (many small attacks)
- Early-game forging (offense scales better early)

**Example Names** (flavor):
- "Ember's Tooth" (first Forge-Matron's sword)
- "Ashen Fang" (famous duelist's blade)
- "Lava's Edge" (forged in volcanic eruption)

**Math**:
- Base attack: 3 damage
- With +1 Ancestral Blade: 4 damage
- Over 10 attacks: 40 damage vs 30 damage = +10 damage total (significant)

---

### Option 2: Ancestral Plate (+1 Defense)

**Effect**: +1 Defense permanently (reduces all damage taken by 1, minimum 1)

**Best For**:
- Tank builds (Forge-Matron style)
- Defensive duelists (survive long duels)
- Mid-game forging (survivability matters more mid-game)

**Example Names** (flavor):
- "Unburnt's Ward" (Forge-Matron Kerra's armor)
- "Ironpeak Shell" (mountain clan heirloom)
- "Molten Carapace" (forged from lava-hardened steel)

**Math**:
- Enemy attack: 5 damage
- Without Ancestral Plate: 5 damage taken
- With +1 Ancestral Plate: 4 damage taken (20% reduction)
- Over 10 enemy attacks: 40 damage vs 50 damage = 10 HP saved

---

### Option 3: Ancestral Boots (+1 Movement)

**Effect**: +1 movement permanently (6 hexes per turn instead of 5)

**Best For**:
- Mobile duelists (Ashen-King style)
- Hit-and-run builds (Magma Veins teleport synergy)
- Late-game forging (mobility matters more late-game)

**Example Names** (flavor):
- "Stormstrider Greaves" (legendary scout's boots)
- "Lava Walker Sabatons" (volcanic traversal gear)
- "Ashen Stride" (move through battlefield like smoke)

**Math**:
- Base movement: 5 hexes/turn
- With +1 Ancestral Boots: 6 hexes/turn (20% increase)
- Over 10 turns: 60 hexes vs 50 hexes = +10 hexes total movement (better positioning)

---

## Forging Priority

### Mission 1: Forge Ancestral Blade (+1 Damage)

**Reasoning**:
- Early-game offense > defense (kill enemies fast)
- +1 damage applies to every attack (immediate value)
- Snowballs into mid-game (more damage = more kills = more Forge tokens)

**Alternative**: Skip forging if only 4 tokens (save for Mission 2)

---

### Mission 2: Forge Ancestral Blade (+1 Damage) OR Ancestral Plate (+1 Defense)

**If Aggressive Build**:
- Forge 2nd Ancestral Blade (total +2 damage permanently)
- Reasoning: Double down on offense (kill faster)

**If Defensive Build**:
- Forge Ancestral Plate (total +1 damage, +1 Defense)
- Reasoning: Balance offense and defense (survive longer)

---

### Mission 3: Forge Ancestral Plate (+1 Defense) OR Ancestral Boots (+1 Movement)

**If Tank Build**:
- Forge 2nd Ancestral Plate (total +1 damage, +2 Defense)
- Reasoning: Become unkillable tank

**If Mobile Build**:
- Forge Ancestral Boots (total +2 damage, +1 movement)
- Reasoning: Maximize mobility for hit-and-run

**Max Reached**: 3 Ancestral Weapons (no more forging after Mission 3)

## Ancestral Iron Synergies

### Ancestral Blade + Emberforged Strike

**Combo**:
- Ancestral Blade: +1 damage permanently
- Emberforged Strike: 5 damage + 2 tokens for 7 damage
- **Result**: 5 base + 1 (Ancestral) + 2 (Emberforged) = 8 damage + burn

**Value**: Every attack benefits from Ancestral bonus (compounds with buffs)

---

### Ancestral Plate + Forge Blessing

**Combo**:
- Ancestral Plate: +1 Defense permanently
- Forge Blessing: Reduce damage by 3 (or 5 in lava)
- **Result**: Enemy attacks reduced by 4 (or 6 in lava)

**Value**: Layered defenses (nearly invincible)

---

### Ancestral Boots + Magma Veins

**Combo**:
- Ancestral Boots: +1 movement permanently (6 hexes/turn)
- Magma Veins: Teleport to lava (3 tokens)
- **Result**: Move 6 hexes → teleport to lava → move another 6 hexes = 12 hexes/turn

**Value**: Extreme mobility (cross entire battlefield in 1 turn)

---

## Ancestral Armor Passive (Expansion Card)

**Effect**: For each Ancestral Weapon you have, gain +1 Defense (max +3).

**Why This Is Powerful**:
- Converts Ancestral Blades (offense) into Defense (survivability)
- **Example**: 3 Ancestral Blades + Ancestral Armor passive = +3 damage + +3 Defense
- **Result**: Offense AND defense simultaneously (broken combo)

**Balance**: Requires faction card slot (trade-off for power)

---

## Losing Ancestral Weapons

### When Can Weapons Be Lost?

**Story Events**:
- Casket destroyed in campaign (lose all Ancestral Weapons)
- Stolen by enemy (specific quest/scenario)
- Sacrificed for ritual (player choice)

**Game Mechanics**:
- Weapons persist across missions (normal play)
- Only lost via story/GM decision (not random)

**If Lost**:
- Can forge replacement (costs 5 Forge tokens again)
- Doesn't count against 3-weapon limit (lost weapon "slot" reopens)

## Ancestral Iron Lore

### The First Forging (Year 0)

**Myth**: When Sundering occurred, meteorite fell into volcano
- First Forge-Matron (name lost) retrieved meteorite iron
- Forged first Ancestral Weapon (Ember's Tooth sword)
- **Blade glowed with volcanic energy** (never dulled, never broke)

**Legacy**: All Ancestral Weapons forged from same meteorite iron source

---

### Lineage Inheritance

**Tradition**: Ancestral Weapons passed to eldest child
- Father dies → son inherits weapon
- Mother dies → daughter inherits armor
- **Exception**: If child unworthy, weapon given to strongest warrior in Pack

**Modern Practice** (Year 437):
- Few children survive (low birth rate, harsh life)
- Many Ancestral Weapons lost (owners died without heirs)
- **Result**: Only ~50 Ancestral Weapons remain (down from 1000+ pre-Sundering)

---

## Ancestral Iron Mistakes to Avoid

### X Don't Forget to Forge at Mission End

**Problem**: Leftover Forge tokens wasted (no carry-over between missions)  
**Solution**: Always spend 5 tokens on Ancestral Iron at mission end

### X Don't Forge Same Bonus 3 Times Without Reason

**Problem**: 3× +1 movement = +3 movement total, but diminishing returns (6→7→8 hexes/turn isn't huge)  
**Solution**: Diversify (1 damage, 1 Defense, 1 movement = balanced)

### X Don't Forge Defense First If Aggressive

**Problem**: +1 Defense doesn't help kill enemies faster (offense > defense early)  
**Solution**: Forge damage first (Mission 1), defense later (Mission 2-3)

### X Don't Assume Ancestral Weapons Carry to New Campaign

**Problem**: Ancestral Weapons persist *within* campaign, not *between* campaigns  
**Solution**: Each campaign starts fresh (no carry-over from previous campaign)
