## STRATEGIC CHOICES

### Aggressive Build (Alpha Strike)
- **Units**: Fenmar Pack Hunters + Serrak Assassin
- **Strategy**: Fast flanking, focus fire wounded targets, assassinate priority enemies
- **Weakness**: Fragile, collapses if caught in AOE

### Defensive Build (Endurance)
- **Units**: Urtok Berserker + Vexis Swarmling
- **Strategy**: Tank with Urtok, swarm enemies, create Chitin Shell terrain for Defense bonuses
- **Weakness**: Slow, struggles vs kiting enemies

### Balanced Build (Versatility)
- **Units**: Corvath Murder + Fenmar Pack Hunters + Urtok Berserker
- **Strategy**: Scout with Corvath, flank with Fenmar, tank with Urtok
- **Weakness**: Equipment slot heavy (requires 3 slots)

### Elite Build (Endgame)
- **Units**: Primal Alpha (solo)
- **Strategy**: Unleash the ultimate Vestige champion
- **Weakness**: Single point of failure, expensive to field

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Bloodline Identity
- **Fenmar**: Speed, pack tactics, flanking
- **Urtok**: Durability, area control, tanking
- **Corvath**: Intelligence, scouting, harassment
- **Vexis**: Adaptation, terrain control, swarm
- **Serrak**: Lethality, stealth, elimination

- **Starter units**: Reliable, straightforward (4-5 abilities)
- **Unlockable units**: Specialized, powerful (5-6 abilities)
- **Elite unit**: Game-changing, legendary (8+ abilities)

### Counterplay
- **Fenmar**: AOE attacks, area denial (punish clustering)
- **Urtok**: Armor piercing, % damage (bypass Defense)
- **Corvath**: AOE attacks (destroy swarm instantly)
- **Vexis**: Burst damage (kill before evolution stacks)
- **Serrak**: Reveal abilities, group tactics (no isolated targets)
- **Primal Alpha**: Focus fire, debuffs, kiting (avoid melee)

## DESIGN NOTES

**Status**: This document is a design framework. Full behavior decks (6 cards per unit) are pending development.

**Balance Targets**:
- Starter units: ~60% power of Casket (supportive role)
- Unlockable units: ~70% power of Casket (tactical advantage)
- Elite unit: ~90% power of Casket (legitimate threat)

**Next Steps**:
1. Develop complete behavior decks for each unit (6 cards each)
2. Playtest pack tactics mechanics (ensure +1 damage per ally isn't overpowered)
3. Balance Primal Alpha (ensure it's strong but not game-breaking)
4. Create visual reference cards for Tabletop Simulator
