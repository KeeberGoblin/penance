# The Vestige Bloodlines - Origin Story

**Timeline**: Year 0 (The Sundering) to Year 437 (Present Day)

---

## Year 0: The Sundering

### The Evacuation

When Dr. Nikolas Theslar activated the Theslar Engine, evacuation orders went out across the Old World:
- **Major cities**: Evacuated within hours (millions saved)
- **Rural settlements**: Evacuated within weeks (thousands saved)
- **Remote border towns near Sibaria**: **Never got the message** (forgotten)

### The Left Behind

**Approximately 60,000 people** in 47 settlements within the Void-heavy exclusion zone:
- Farmers, miners, frontier families—"forgotten villages"
- They didn't know the world had ended until the first Pulse hit
- By the time they realized, evacuation routes were closed (Void saturation)

**The First Transmission** (Year 0, Day 3):
> "This is Mayor Fenneth of Wolfhollow. We need evacuation. The sky is wrong. People are sick. Please respond. Anyone. Please."

No response ever came. The transmission repeated for 6 days, then stopped.

## Year 1-5: The Slow Death

### Initial Symptoms

Void radiation began mutating survivors:
- **First symptoms**: Nosebleeds, hair loss, fever, strange cravings
- **Psychological changes**: Eating raw meat, craving metal/minerals
- **Physical changes**: Skin discoloration, bone deformities, extra growths

### The Children

Children born during this period were **normal at first**, then rapidly mutated within weeks:
- Infants aged 0-6 months: Developed animal traits by age 1
- The first "stable" mutation: A child with wolf ears (Wolfhollow, Year 2)
- Parents terrified but protective—"She's still our daughter"

### First Deaths

Year 5 saw the first Void-related deaths:
- **Total deaths**: ~15,000 (25% of original population)
- **Causes**: Organ failure, complete mutation (became mindless Abominations), suicide
- **Survivors**: ~45,000 remaining

---

## Year 10-20: The First Bloodlines Emerge

### Pattern Recognition

By Year 10, survivors noticed patterns:
- **Families from forested regions** → lupine traits (wolf-like features)
- **Families from mountain regions** → ursine traits (bear-like strength)
- **Families from swamp regions** → chitinous traits (insect exoskeletons)
- **Families from plains** → avian traits (raven-like features)
- **Families from deserts** → reptilian traits (serpent scales)

### Why Different Mutations?

**The Void doesn't create—it amplifies:**
- It latched onto dominant environmental DNA (local predators, ecosystems)
- Forest wolves → wolf-blooded humans
- Mountain bears → bear-kin humans
- Swamp insects → chitin-bearers
- Plains ravens → raven-touched humans
- Desert serpents → serpent-scaled humans

### The First Bloodline Names

**Year 18**: Survivors formally named the five major strains:

1. **Fenmar Bloodline** (wolf-blooded, forest survivors from Wolfhollow & Fenwood)
2. **Urtok Bloodline** (bear-kin, mountain survivors from Ironpeak & Urtok Mines)
3. **Vexis Bloodline** (chitin-bearers, swamp survivors from Vex Marsh)
4. **Corvath Bloodline** (raven-touched, plains survivors from Corvath Fields)
5. **Serrak Bloodline** (serpent-scaled, desert survivors from Serrak Wastes)

**Minor bloodlines also emerged**: Thorn (plant-hybrid), Kraken (aquatic), Scorpid (scorpion), Viper (distinct from Serrak)—but these were rare or went extinct.

---

## Year 30-50: The Realization

### Three Horrifying Truths

By Year 30, survivors realized:

1. **Mutations are hereditary** (children inherit parents' strains, often amplified)
2. **Mutations are unstable** (third-generation children are becoming unrecognizable)
3. **There is no cure** (Church refuses to help, Elves can't reverse Void corruption)

### The First Vestige Council (Year 47)

Representatives from all bloodlines gathered at the ruins of Wolfhollow:
- **Representatives**: 5 elders (one per bloodline)
- **Declaration**: "We are **The Vestige Bloodlines**—no longer human, but not Abominations"
- **Laws established**:
  - Protect all bearers (regardless of bloodline)
  - Hunt to survive (no murder of innocents)
  - Never surrender (death before capture)
- **Motto chosen**: **"MEMORIA MORIENTES"** (We Are The Memory of the Dying)

**The motto honors**: Ancestors who died becoming this, and the future dead (extinction is inevitable).

## Year 100-300: Diaspora & Persecution

### Year 73: First Contact with Church

Church scouts discover Vestige settlements:
- **Church reaction**: "Taint-corrupted abominations, must be purified"
- **Vestige reaction**: "We're still human, we were abandoned"
- **Church verdict**: "Corrupted by Void = sin incarnate = extermination justified"

### Year 352: The Exodus

**Church declares Purification Crusade**: Exterminate all Taint-corrupted beings.

**The Exodus King** (Vestige Fenmar, name lost to history):
- Organized mass evacuation of 40,000 Vestige from Church territories
- Led survivors through the Scorched Wastes (800-mile death march)
- **Casualties**: 15,000 died en route (starvation, Church attacks, Abominations)
- **Survivors**: 25,000 reached remote badlands, wastelands, cursed forests

**Result**: Bloodlines became nomadic, never settling (hunted wherever they go).

## Year 300-400: Generational Degradation

### The Four Generations

By Year 300, the genetic degradation pattern was clear:

#### **1st Generation (Year 0-50 survivors)**
- **Minor mutations**: Ears, tails, claws—mostly cosmetic
- **Mentally stable**: Fully coherent, retained humanity
- **Lifespan**: Normal human (60-80 years)
- **Current survivors**: ~200 remain (Year 437)

#### **2nd Generation (Year 20-100 births)**
- **Major mutations**: Wolf heads, fur, digitigrade legs—significant changes
- **Mentally stable**: Still coherent, but more bestial instincts
- **Lifespan**: Shortened (40-60 years)
- **Current population**: ~8,000 remain (Year 437)

#### **3rd Generation (Year 100-300 births)**
- **Severe mutations**: Extra limbs, partial Abomination traits—barely recognizable as human
- **Mentally unstable**: Coherent but volatile, prone to feral episodes
- **Lifespan**: Very short (30-50 years)
- **Current population**: ~12,000 remain (Year 437)

#### **4th Generation (Year 300-present births)**
- **Borderline Abominations**: Many born as full Abominations (mindless, feral)
- **Mentally degraded**: Those who survive are barely coherent (like Sella Vexis)
- **Lifespan**: Unknown (none have lived past 25 yet)
- **Current population**: ~4,800 remain (Year 437)
- **Survival rate**: 1 in 10 births are stable enough to raise

---

## Year 437: Present Day

### Current Status

**Total Vestige Bloodline population**: ~25,000 (down from 60,000 at peak)

**Population breakdown**:
- Fenmar (Wolf-Blooded): ~10,000 (40%)
- Urtok (Bear-Kin): ~6,250 (25%)
- Vexis (Chitin-Bearers): ~3,750 (15%)
- Corvath (Raven-Touched): ~3,000 (12%)
- Serrak (Serpent-Scaled): ~2,000 (8%)

### The Extinction Clock

**Vestige scholars calculate**: **150 years until total genetic collapse** (Year 587).

**Evidence**:
- 4th generation survival rate: 10% (dropping)
- 5th generation (if any are born): Predicted 0% survival rate
- Mutations accelerating exponentially each generation
- No known cure or stabilization method

### Desperate Choices

**Vestige Council debates** (Year 437, ongoing):

1. **Seek cure?**
   - Pros: Only hope for survival
   - Cons: No faction willing to help (Church wants them dead, Elves can't fix Void corruption, Dwarves don't care)

2. **Join Emergent Syndicate?**
   - Pros: Controlled evolution, scientific approach, hive-mind stability
   - Cons: Lose individuality, become fully insectoid (Vexis considering this)

3. **Accept extinction?**
   - Pros: Peaceful end, no more suffering for future generations
   - Cons: Bloodlines die, ancestors' sacrifices wasted

4. **Mercy killings?**
   - **Current practice**: 4th generation children born as Abominations are mercy-killed at birth
   - **Debate**: Should all 4th generation be sterilized to prevent further suffering?
