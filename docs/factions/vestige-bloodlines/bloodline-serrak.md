## Bloodline Mechanics

### Serrak-Specific Bonuses
- **Serpent's Coil (Serrak-only)**: Deal 4 damage, immobilize target, inflict poison (2 damage next turn)
- **Bloodline Shift (Serrak form)**: All attacks inflict poison (2 damage next turn), +1 movement
- **Venom Resistance (Passive)**: Immune to poison damage, cannot be poisoned

### Serrak Transformation (Bloodline Shift)
**Cost**: 2 Biomass tokens  
**Effect**: Transform into enhanced serpent form until end of round:
- **All attacks inflict poison** (2 damage at start of target's next turn)
- **+1 movement** (total 6 hexes per turn)
- **Cannot be grappled** (serpent flexibility, escape holds automatically)

### Recommended Deck Build
**Faction Cards (6)**: Vestige Heritage, Bloodline Shift (Serrak form), Serpent's Coil, Predator's Mark, Venomous Spit, Scent of Blood

**Primary Weapon**: Focus on Leaping Pounce (ambush) and Savage Strike (poison synergy)

**Secondary Equipment**: Venomous Spit (ranged poison), Tracking Scent (hunt Prey)

**Strategy:** Poison and control through Serpent's Coil (4 damage + immobilize + poison). Bloodline Shift makes all attacks poison. Mark high-value targets with Predator's Mark. Venomous Spit for ranged poison. Scent of Blood executes poisoned enemies. Control and kill.

## Serrak Contracts (Assassin Services)

### Contract Tiers
- **Tier 1 (500 Credits)**: Standard assassination (no witnesses, clean kill)
- **Tier 2 (2000 Credits)**: High-value target (defended, requires infiltration)
- **Tier 3 (5000 Credits)**: Impossible contracts (Casket pilots, faction leaders)

### Contract Rules
1. **Payment upfront** (no refunds, even if target dies before completion)
2. **No questions asked** (client identity protected)
3. **100% completion** (Serrak never fail contracts)
4. **Silence guaranteed** (no survivors, no evidence)

### How to Hire Serrak
- **Leave contract at Crossroads market** (Corvath intermediaries deliver to Serrak)
- **Payment in Soulstones only** (Credits not accepted, too traceable)
- **Wait for confirmation** (Serrak agent will contact within 3 days)
