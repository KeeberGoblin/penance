## The Silent Devolution

### Without Caskets: The Serpent's Coil

**Serrak degradation timeline (unknown generation, estimated 2nd-3rd):**

- **0-6 hours disconnected**: Speech loss, reverts to hissing, total silence, predatory instinct heightens
- **6-12 hours**: Limbs begin retracting into torso, arms shrink, legs fuse together
- **12-18 hours**: Spine extends into serpent tail (10+ feet), venom production spirals out of control
- **18-24 hours**: Limbs fully absorbed, pure snake form, body becomes toxic to touch
- **24-48 hours**: Consciousness fades, pure predator instinct, strikes at anything that moves
- **48+ hours**: Permanent serpent form, cannot be restored, must be killed before venom kills them

**Note:** Serrak refuse to share exact degradation data. Above timeline reconstructed from Church Inquisition reports and rare witnessed incidents.

### The Assassin's Irony

**Serrak are masters of control:**

- Contracts: 100% completion rate
- Precision: Single strike kills
- Discipline: Perfect silence, infinite patience
- Reputation: Most feared assassins in the wasteland

**But their greatest fear is losing control:**

**From a recovered Serrak contract tablet (Year 421):**

> "Target: Church Inquisitor Markus Valen
>
> Payment: 5 Soulstones (upfront, received)
>
> Deadline: 72 hours
>
> Personal note: If I do not complete contract within 48 hours, assume I went feral. Send kill team to my last known location. Do not attempt recovery. Just kill me.
>
> I can only disconnect 6 hours safely. This contract requires 8+ hours of infiltration. I am gambling with my humanity. Again.
>
> If you are reading this and I am a serpent, thank you for ending it quickly."

**Contract was completed at hour 47. Assassin reported severe limb retraction, had to crawl final 200 meters. Kill was successful. Reconnected at hour 47:32. Arms required 3 weeks to fully regenerate.**

### The Casket as Cage

**What makes Serrak dependency uniquely horrifying:**

1. **Total speech loss**: Serrak disconnect and cannot call for help (only hissing)
2. **Limb retraction**: Arms vanish within 12 hours, cannot operate Casket controls to reconnect
3. **Venom spiral**: Their own venom becomes lethal to themselves when disconnected
4. **Permanent damage**: Limb retraction can become irreversible if disconnected too long

**Serrak Caskets are modified with:**

- Voice synthesizers (since disconnected Serrak cannot speak)
- Remote reconnection systems (can be activated by allies if pilot goes feral)
- Venom regulators (prevent self-poisoning)
- Limb preservation modules (artificial arms if natural ones retract permanently)

### The Silent Coil's Truth

**If the rumors are true (1st generation survivor, 437+ years old):**

> "I haven't had legs in 300 years. The Casket regrew them. Artificial limbs, nerve-sleeved, mechanical bones wrapped in cloned flesh.
>
> I disconnected once. Year 124. For 16 hours. My arms retracted. My legs fused. When they reconnected me, the damage was permanent. My original limbs were gone.
>
> Everything you see is machine. The legs. The arms. The voice (I cannot speak without synthesizer, my jaw is too serpentine). Even my venom glands are regulated by the Casket's filtration system.
>
> I am more cage than flesh now. More machine than beast. I do not disconnect. I *cannot* disconnect. There is nothing left to suppress. The Casket IS my body now.
>
> The other Serrak fear becoming serpents. I fear I already am one, wearing a human-shaped machine as camouflage."

### The 6-Hour Gamble

**Most Serrak operational parameters:**

- **Safe disconnection limit**: 6 hours maximum
- **Mission time limit**: Most contracts require 4-8 hours of infiltration
- **The gamble**: Every contract risks transformation
- **Failure mode**: If mission takes too long, assassin becomes the monster

**Why Serrak have 100% completion rate:**

- Not because they never fail
- But because if they fail, they cannot report it
- They transform into serpents and are killed by their own backup teams
- Dead Serrak cannot file failure reports

**The truth:** Unknown number of "successful" contracts are actually transformations that were mercy-killed.

### Why Serrak Value Silence

**Outsiders think it's discipline. The truth is darker:**

- Serrak who disconnect for even 2 hours begin losing speech
- Silence is practice for the inevitable
- "Unnecessary words are weakness" really means "we're forgetting how to speak"
- Every mission where they disconnect, they come back a little more serpent
- Silence is acceptance of what they're becoming

### The Contract Oath

**Every Serrak swears this upon taking first contract:**

> "I accept the coil. I accept the silence. I accept that one day, I will not return.
>
> When that day comes, do not mourn me. Do not try to save me. Just kill me quickly.
>
> The contract is law. My humanity is the price. I pay willingly.
>
> SILENTIUM SEMPITERNUM" (Silence Eternal)

## Bloodline Mechanics

### Serrak-Specific Bonuses
- **Serpent's Coil (Serrak-only)**: Deal 4 damage, immobilize target, inflict poison (2 damage next turn)
- **Bloodline Shift (Serrak form)**: All attacks inflict poison (2 damage next turn), +1 movement
- **Venom Resistance (Passive)**: Immune to poison damage, cannot be poisoned

### Serrak Transformation (Bloodline Shift)
**Cost**: 2 Biomass tokens  
**Effect**: Transform into enhanced serpent form until end of round:
- **All attacks inflict poison** (2 damage at start of target's next turn)
- **+1 movement** (total 6 hexes per turn)
- **Cannot be grappled** (serpent flexibility, escape holds automatically)

### Recommended Deck Build
**Faction Cards (6)**: Vestige Heritage, Bloodline Shift (Serrak form), Serpent's Coil, Predator's Mark, Venomous Spit, Scent of Blood

**Primary Weapon**: Focus on Leaping Pounce (ambush) and Savage Strike (poison synergy)

**Secondary Equipment**: Venomous Spit (ranged poison), Tracking Scent (hunt Prey)

**Strategy:** Poison and control through Serpent's Coil (4 damage + immobilize + poison). Bloodline Shift makes all attacks poison. Mark high-value targets with Predator's Mark. Venomous Spit for ranged poison. Scent of Blood executes poisoned enemies. Control and kill.
