## The Feral Problem

### Without Caskets: The Transformation Timeline

**Fenmar degradation (4th generation like Matron Kael):**

- **0-6 hours disconnected**: Coherent but agitated, pack-instinct heightened, increased aggression
- **6-12 hours**: Speech deteriorates into growls and snarls, extra fur growth begins, claws extend
- **12-18 hours**: Forgets own name, recognizes only pack members by scent, jaw structure begins shifting
- **18-24 hours**: Digitigrade legs lock into wolf stance—cannot walk upright anymore
- **24-48 hours**: Full lupine transformation—quadrupedal, hands become paws, speech physically impossible
- **48-72 hours**: No human consciousness remains—pure wolf, attacks anything not pack
- **72+ hours**: Permanent feral state—must be mercy-killed, cannot be restored

### Matron Kael's Burden

**Personal testimony (Year 435, Vestige Council):**

> "I watched my sister disconnect for 3 days once. She thought she was strong enough. Thought she could 'beat the wolf.'
>
> By hour 12, she couldn't say my name. By day two, her hands were paws. She tried to scream for help, but her jaw had already changed—only howls came out.
>
> By day three, there was no sister left. Just a wolf wearing her scars. She didn't recognize me. She attacked me.
>
> I had to... I was the one who...
>
> I can disconnect for 6 hours maximum now. Any longer, and I forget my own name. I forget I was ever human. The wolf takes everything."

### The Pack-Mind Solution

**Fenmar discovered that group neural synchronization extends coherence:**

- **Pack-linking**: Connected Fenmar can share neural load via auxiliary ports
- **Alpha anchoring**: Matron Kael's Casket has 6 auxiliary neural ports for direct pack-linking
- **Shared stability**: Alpha's stronger mental patterns help stabilize weaker pack members
- **Extended coherence**: Linked Fenmar can disconnect for up to 12 hours (double individual limit)

**The tragedy:** When a pack member dies, the survivors' coherence drops proportionally. Lose too many, and the whole pack begins degrading faster.

**Current pack status (Year 437):**
- Kael's core pack: 23 members
- 8 members can only disconnect for 4 hours (severe 4th gen)
- 12 members can disconnect for 6 hours (stable 4th gen, like Kael)
- 3 members can disconnect for 8 hours (late 3rd gen elders)

**Kael's greatest fear:**
> "Every pack member who dies takes a piece of all of us with them. I'm holding 23 minds together, including my own. When I die, they all go feral within days. I am not just their Alpha. I am their anchor. And I am drowning."

### Why Fenmar Never Operate Alone

**This is why Fenmar pack tactics aren't just strategy—they're survival:**

- Solo Fenmar degrade twice as fast (no pack-mind support)
- Isolated wolves typically go feral within 12 hours
- Pack bonds literally preserve humanity through shared consciousness
- "The pack hunts together" is not a motto—**it's a medical necessity**

## Notable NPC: Matron Kael Fenmar

### Title
**Last Stable Alpha of Fenmar Bloodline**

### Basic Info
- **Age**: 37 (4th generation—knows she's the last stable generation)
- **Casket**: "The Howling Dirge" (wolf-skull motif, pack coordination systems)
- **Generation**: 4th (borderline Abomination, but miraculously stable)

### Appearance
- **Lupine head** (fully wolf, gray-black fur)
- **Amber eyes** (glow faintly in darkness)
- **Digitigrade legs** (wolf stance)
- **Wears ancestral pelts** (30+ generations of Fenmar leaders, ceremonial armor)
- **Ritual scars** across arms (one per pack member lost—47 scars total)

### Personality
- **Fiercely protective** of all Vestige (not just Fenmar)
- **Haunted** by knowledge she's the last stable generation
- **Refuses to have children** (won't pass curse to 5th generation)
- **Mother-figure** to younger Vestige (they call her "Matron")
- **Strategic thinker** (leads with cunning, not just strength)

### Unique Abilities

#### Alpha's Howl (3 SP)
All Fenmar allies within 8 hexes gain +2 damage and +2 movement for 2 turns (ultimate pack buff).

#### Blood Memory (Passive)
Can copy any ability used by a Fenmar ally within 4 hexes (hive-mind coordination).

#### Last Stand (5 Biomass)
If Kael would die, resurrect at 1 HP. All Fenmar allies gain +3 damage permanently this mission (martyr buff).

### Backstory
- **Born Year 400**, raised during constant Church persecution
- **Led the Fenmar exodus** from Fenwood (5,000 wolves fled, 2,000 survived)
- **Established current Fenmar territories** (nomadic, no fixed home)
- **Knows Fenmar bloodline will die with her generation**—seeking cure desperately
- **Lost entire original pack** to Church Inquisition raid (Year 423)
- **Current pack**: 23 members (mix of 3rd and 4th generation, all sterile or unstable)

### Campaign Hook
Players can help Kael search for genetic stabilization cure:
- **Elven botanists** (Worldheart sap rumored to purify Taint)
- **Ossuarium necromancers** (soul-binding to stabilize mutations)
- **Dwarven runecraft** (genetic encoding through runic inscription)

If cure fails, Kael plans to lead final Fenmar exodus into the Void (controlled extinction).
