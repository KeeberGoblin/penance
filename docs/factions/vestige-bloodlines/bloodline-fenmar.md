## Notable NPC: Matron Kael Fenmar

### Title
**Last Stable Alpha of Fenmar Bloodline**

- **Ritual scars** across arms (one per pack member lost—47 scars total)

### Personality
- **Fiercely protective** of all Vestige (not just Fenmar)

- **Refuses to have children** (won't pass curse to 5th generation)
- **Mother-figure** to younger Vestige (they call her "Matron")

### Unique Abilities

#### Alpha's Howl (3 SP)
All Fenmar allies within 8 hexes gain +2 damage and +2 movement for 2 turns (ultimate pack buff).

#### Blood Memory (Passive)
Can copy any ability used by a Fenmar ally within 4 hexes (hive-mind coordination).

If Kael would die, resurrect at 1 HP. All Fenmar allies gain +3 damage permanently this mission (martyr buff).

### Backstory
- **Born Year 400**, raised during constant Church persecution
- **Led the Fenmar exodus** from Fenwood (5,000 wolves fled, 2,000 survived)
- **Established current Fenmar territories** (nomadic, no fixed home)
- **Knows Fenmar bloodline will die with her generation**—seeking cure desperately
- **Lost entire original pack** to Church Inquisition raid (Year 423)
- **Current pack**: 23 members (mix of 3rd and 4th generation, all sterile or unstable)

### Campaign Hook
Players can help Kael search for genetic stabilization cure:
- **Elven botanists** (Worldheart sap rumored to purify Taint)
- **Ossuarium necromancers** (soul-binding to stabilize mutations)
- **Dwarven runecraft** (genetic encoding through runic inscription)

If cure fails, Kael plans to lead final Fenmar exodus into the Void (controlled extinction).
