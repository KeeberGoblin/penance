# Vexis Bloodline (Chitin-Bearers)

**Motto**: "Shed the shell. Embrace the form."

**Population**: ~3,750 (15% of all Vestige)  
**Homeland**: Vex Marsh (toxic swamp, former alchemical dumping ground)  
**Deck Archetype**: Mutation Specialist (Carapace Molt, Adaptive Evolution, Bloodline Shift synergies)

## Traits

### Physical Features
- **Insectoid head** (compound eyes, mandibles, antennae)
- **Compound eyes** (no pupils, just facets - 360° vision)
- **Mandibles** (chitinous jaw structure, natural weapon)
- **Chitinous plates** (exoskeleton armor, natural Defense +1)
- **Antennae** (detect vibrations, chemical signals)
- **4-6 limbs** (extra arms grow randomly, arthropod advantage)

### Biological Capabilities
- **Exoskeleton armor** (natural Defense +1, sheds and regrows)
- **Molt cycles** (shed damaged shell weekly, regenerate)
- **Can eat nearly anything** (digest metal, wood, rotting meat)
- **Chemical resistance** (immune to toxins, thrive in Vex Marsh)

---

## Culture

### Social Structure
- **Communal living** (nest-structures, shared burrows)
- **Hive mentality** (collective decision-making, not individuals)
- **No leaders** (decisions by consensus, pheromone voting)
- **Family units** blend together (hard to distinguish bloodlines within Vexis)

### Traditions
- **Ritualistic molting** (shed old shell = rebirth ceremony)
- **Collective meals** (entire nest eats together, share prey)
- **Nest building** (construct elaborate burrow systems, arthropod architecture)
- **"The Great Molting"** (annual full-body shed, sacred ritual)

### Beliefs
- **Molt is rebirth** (each shed = new life, celebrate transformation)
- **"We are becoming"** (believe they're evolving into something greater)
- **Chitin is memory** (old shells contain genetic history, preserve them)
- **Feared by other bloodlines** (most "inhuman" appearance, unsettling)

## Notable NPC: Hive-Mother Sella Vexis

### Title
**Living Chrysalis, 4th Generation Horror**

### Basic Info
- **Age**: 22 (4th generation—shouldn't be coherent, genetic miracle)
- **Casket**: "The Puparium" (bio-mechanical cocoon, constantly molting)
- **Generation**: 4th (borderline Abomination, barely human)

### Appearance
- **Barely recognizable as human**
- **Compound eyes** (no pupils, just reflective facets)
- **Mandibles** (chitinous mouth, no lips)
- **Four chitinous arms** (mantis-like, segmented)
- **Segmented torso** (exoskeleton plates, constantly shedding)
- **Speaks in third person** ("This one hungers", "We require biomass")

### Personality
- **Childlike curiosity** (asks innocent questions about violence)
- **No concept of pain/emotion** (insect mindset, alien thought patterns)
- **Refers to herself as "we"** (hive-mind bleed from Emergent Syndicate exposure?)
- **Obsessed with efficiency** (will sacrifice Vexis for "optimal outcomes")
- **Barely coherent** (sentences fragment, thoughts incomplete)

### Unique Abilities

#### Perpetual Molt (Passive)
At start of each round, shed exoskeleton (remove 1 damage card, gain +1 Defense this round).

#### Hive Spawn (5 Biomass)
Summon 2 Vexis Swarmlings (6 HP, 2 damage, fight for you until destroyed).

#### Metamorphosis (Ultimate, once per mission)
Enter chrysalis for 2 turns (cannot act, invulnerable). Emerge fully healed, +3 Defense permanently, all attacks poison.

### Backstory
- **Born Year 415**, 4th generation (genetic catastrophe, should be Abomination)
- **Parents mercy-killed her siblings** (all 6 born as full Abominations, mindless)
- **Sella survived through sheer luck** (stable mutation, 1 in 1000 chance)
- **Believes she's "transitioning"** (becoming full insect, losing humanity)
- **Emergent Syndicate has offered her membership** (she's considering it, may join controlled evolution)
- **Speaks to "the voice in the chitin"** (unknown if hallucination or hive-mind connection)

### Campaign Hook
Players can:
- **Prevent Sella from joining Emergent Syndicate** (save last coherent Vexis leader)
- **Help her transition** (mercy-kill or guide into full metamorphosis)
- **Study her mutations** (uncover genetic secrets, potential cure?)

If she joins Syndicate, Vexis bloodline effectively ends (absorbed into collective).

## Bloodline Mechanics

### Vexis-Specific Bonuses
- **Carapace Molt (Vexis-only)**: Negate 5+ damage, recover 3 cards (shed damaged shell)
- **Bloodline Shift (Vexis form)**: +2 Defense, molt reaction (negate 1 attack per round)
- **Exoskeleton (Passive)**: Start with +1 Defense (natural armor)

### Vexis Transformation (Bloodline Shift)
**Cost**: 2 Biomass tokens  
**Effect**: Transform into enhanced chitin form until end of round:
- **+2 Defense** (total Defense can reach 6-8)
- **Molt reaction** (negate 1 attack per round, automatic)
- **Regenerate 1 card when molting** (defensive lifesteal)

### Recommended Deck Build
**Faction Cards (6)**: Vestige Heritage, Bloodline Shift (Vexis form), Carapace Molt, Adaptive Evolution, Reactive Scales, Regenerative Flesh

**Primary Weapon**: Focus on Frenzy (multi-hit) and Rending Claws (consistent damage)

**Secondary Equipment**: Reactive Scales (layer defenses), Regenerative Flesh (molt synergy)

**Strategy**: Maximum mutation stacking. Carapace Molt negates big hits. Bloodline Shift for molt reactions. Adaptive Evolution for controlled transformations. Become unkillable mutation engine.

## Vexis Settlements

### The Vex Nest
- **Location**: Vex Marsh (toxic swamp depths)
- **Population**: 220 Vexis (largest nest)
- **Purpose**: Communal living, breeding chambers, molt repositories
- **Architecture**: Burrow system, chitinous walls, pheromone trails

### The Molting Grounds
- **Location**: Marsh clearing (sacred site)
- **Population**: Varies (0-150 during Great Molting)
- **Purpose**: Annual full-body shed, rebirth ceremony
- **Duration**: 3 days per year (synchronized molting)

### The Shell Archive
- **Location**: Underground chamber (preserved cavern)
- **Population**: None (storage only)
- **Purpose**: Store old exoskeletons (genetic history)
- **Significance**: 150 years of chitin shells, Vexis cultural heritage
