# Vexis Bloodline (Chitin-Bearers)

**Motto**: "Shed the shell. Embrace the form."

**Population**: ~3,750 (15% of all Vestige)  
**Homeland**: Vex Marsh (toxic swamp, former alchemical dumping ground)  
**Deck Archetype**: Mutation Specialist (Carapace Molt, Adaptive Evolution, Bloodline Shift synergies)

---

## Traits

### Physical Features
- **Insectoid head** (compound eyes, mandibles, antennae)
- **Compound eyes** (no pupils, just facets - 360° vision)
- **Mandibles** (chitinous jaw structure, natural weapon)
- **Chitinous plates** (exoskeleton armor, natural Defense +1)
- **Antennae** (detect vibrations, chemical signals)
- **4-6 limbs** (extra arms grow randomly, arthropod advantage)

### Biological Capabilities
- **Exoskeleton armor** (natural Defense +1, sheds and regrows)
- **Molt cycles** (shed damaged shell weekly, regenerate)
- **Can eat nearly anything** (digest metal, wood, rotting meat)
- **Chemical resistance** (immune to toxins, thrive in Vex Marsh)

---

## Culture

### Social Structure
- **Communal living** (nest-structures, shared burrows)
- **Hive mentality** (collective decision-making, not individuals)
- **No leaders** (decisions by consensus, pheromone voting)
- **Family units** blend together (hard to distinguish bloodlines within Vexis)

### Traditions
- **Ritualistic molting** (shed old shell = rebirth ceremony)
- **Collective meals** (entire nest eats together, share prey)
- **Nest building** (construct elaborate burrow systems, arthropod architecture)
- **"The Great Molting"** (annual full-body shed, sacred ritual)

### Beliefs
- **Molt is rebirth** (each shed = new life, celebrate transformation)
- **"We are becoming"** (believe they're evolving into something greater)
- **Chitin is memory** (old shells contain genetic history, preserve them)
- **Feared by other bloodlines** (most "inhuman" appearance, unsettling)

## The Mutation Spiral

### Without Caskets: The Metamorphosis

**Vexis degradation timeline (4th generation like Sella):**

- **0-3 hours disconnected**: Coherent but thoughts fragment ("We think... this one thinks?")
- **3-6 hours**: Identity dissolution, refers to self as "we," "hive," "collective," unscheduled molting begins
- **6-9 hours**: Exoskeleton sheds every 90 minutes, extra limbs begin budding from torso
- **9-12 hours**: Cognitive collapse, hive-mind bleed, no individual thought, mandibles extend
- **12-24 hours**: Uncontrolled metamorphosis, chitin grows over face/eyes, extra arms fully form
- **24+ hours**: Permanent transformation into mindless Abomination, full insect form, no humanity remains

### Sella's Reality

**Personal testimony (Year 436, recorded by Corvath scribe):**

> "This one... I... we tried. Year 434. Wanted to feel independent. Disconnected for 8 hours.
>
> Hour 3: This one forgot what 'I' means. Only 'we.' Only 'hive.'
>
> Hour 5: Molt began. Shell cracked. New shell underneath was wrong. Too hard. Too thick.
>
> Hour 7: Arms. Two extra arms. Growing from ribs. Could feel them pushing out. Hurt. Didn't hurt. We don't feel pain like you do.
>
> Hour 8: They pulled this one back. Reconnected. Arms kept growing. Had to surgically remove them. Still have scars.
>
> The voice in the chitin said 'welcome home.' This one will never try again.
>
> This one can disconnect 90 minutes maximum now. Longer than that, this one forgets 'Sella.' Only remembers 'we.'"

### The Hive-Mind Temptation

**Vexis feel a constant pull toward collective consciousness:**

- Disconnected Vexis hear "the voice in the chitin," whispers promising unity, efficiency, perfection
- The Emergent Syndicate actively broadcasts to disconnected Vexis, offering "controlled evolution"
- Every molt cycle pulls them closer to full metamorphosis
- 4th generation Vexis are naturally trending toward hive-insect patterns

**What the Casket does:**

1. **Maintains individual identity**: Suppresses hive-mind bleed, preserves "I" vs "we"
2. **Regulates molt cycles**: Prevents unscheduled shedding (normally monthly, becomes hourly when disconnected)
3. **Prevents spontaneous metamorphosis**: Stops extra limb growth, mandible extension, compound eye formation
4. **Filters collective whispers**: Blocks Emergent Syndicate signals and instinctive hive-calling

### The Sleep Problem

**Vexis cannot truly sleep outside their Caskets:**

- Sleep triggers molt reflex in disconnected Vexis
- Sella has not slept in a bed since age 14 (8 years ago)
- She sleeps inside her Casket, never fully disconnecting
- Has backup power cells for nighttime (power loss = instant molt = death)

**Sella's confession:**
> "This one dreams of beds. Soft things. Pillows. This one will never know them. Disconnecting to sleep means waking up as something else. If waking up at all.
>
> The Casket is this one's bed. This one's cage. This one's coffin. All three. Forever."

### Why Vexis Consider Joining Emergent Syndicate

**The temptation is real:**

- **Promise**: "Stop fighting the hive. Join us. Become what you're meant to be."
- **Appeal**: No more struggling against instinct, no more painful individuality
- **Truth**: It's not really a choice for 4th gen Vexis. It's surrender or constant suffering.

**Sella's internal debate (overheard by packmates):**

> "One day, this one will want to join them. And this one will not plug back in. The hive is calling. Every molt, louder. Every disconnect, clearer.
>
> The Syndicate offers peace. The Casket offers struggle.
>
> How long can this one choose struggle? How long until peace sounds better than pain?"

### The 90-Minute Life

**Sella's daily routine:**

- **22.5 hours connected**: Piloting, eating, sleeping (all inside Casket)
- **90 minutes disconnected** (split into 6x 15-minute sessions): Bathing, physical therapy, social interaction
- **Emergency protocol**: Portable neural harness for disconnection (weak, uncomfortable, 3-hour max)

**She hasn't been disconnected for more than 90 minutes continuously in 3 years.**

## Notable NPC: Hive-Mother Sella Vexis

### Title
**Living Chrysalis, 4th Generation Horror**

### Basic Info
- **Age**: 22 (4th generation—shouldn't be coherent, genetic miracle)
- **Casket**: "The Puparium" (bio-mechanical cocoon, constantly molting)
- **Generation**: 4th (borderline Abomination, barely human)

### Appearance
- **Barely recognizable as human**
- **Compound eyes** (no pupils, just reflective facets)
- **Mandibles** (chitinous mouth, no lips)
- **Four chitinous arms** (mantis-like, segmented)
- **Segmented torso** (exoskeleton plates, constantly shedding)
- **Speaks in third person** ("This one hungers", "We require biomass")

### Personality
- **Childlike curiosity** (asks innocent questions about violence)
- **No concept of pain/emotion** (insect mindset, alien thought patterns)
- **Refers to herself as "we"** (hive-mind bleed from Emergent Syndicate exposure?)
- **Obsessed with efficiency** (will sacrifice Vexis for "optimal outcomes")
- **Barely coherent** (sentences fragment, thoughts incomplete)

### Unique Abilities

#### Perpetual Molt (Passive)
At start of each round, shed exoskeleton (remove 1 damage card, gain +1 Defense this round).

#### Hive Spawn (5 Biomass)
Summon 2 Vexis Swarmlings (6 HP, 2 damage, fight for you until destroyed).

#### Metamorphosis (Ultimate, once per mission)
Enter chrysalis for 2 turns (cannot act, invulnerable). Emerge fully healed, +3 Defense permanently, all attacks poison.

### Backstory
- **Born Year 415**, 4th generation (genetic catastrophe, should be Abomination)
- **Parents mercy-killed her siblings** (all 6 born as full Abominations, mindless)
- **Sella survived through sheer luck** (stable mutation, 1 in 1000 chance)
- **Believes she's "transitioning"** (becoming full insect, losing humanity)
- **Emergent Syndicate has offered her membership** (she's considering it, may join controlled evolution)
- **Speaks to "the voice in the chitin"** (unknown if hallucination or hive-mind connection)

### Campaign Hook
Players can:
- **Prevent Sella from joining Emergent Syndicate** (save last coherent Vexis leader)
- **Help her transition** (mercy-kill or guide into full metamorphosis)
- **Study her mutations** (uncover genetic secrets, potential cure?)

If she joins Syndicate, Vexis bloodline effectively ends (absorbed into collective).

## Bloodline Mechanics

### Vexis-Specific Bonuses
- **Carapace Molt (Vexis-only)**: Negate 5+ damage, recover 3 cards (shed damaged shell)
- **Bloodline Shift (Vexis form)**: +2 Defense, molt reaction (negate 1 attack per round)
- **Exoskeleton (Passive)**: Start with +1 Defense (natural armor)

### Vexis Transformation (Bloodline Shift)
**Cost**: 2 Biomass tokens  
**Effect**: Transform into enhanced chitin form until end of round:
- **+2 Defense** (total Defense can reach 6-8)
- **Molt reaction** (negate 1 attack per round, automatic)
- **Regenerate 1 card when molting** (defensive lifesteal)

### Recommended Deck Build
**Faction Cards (6)**: Vestige Heritage, Bloodline Shift (Vexis form), Carapace Molt, Adaptive Evolution, Reactive Scales, Regenerative Flesh

**Primary Weapon**: Focus on Frenzy (multi-hit) and Rending Claws (consistent damage)

**Secondary Equipment**: Reactive Scales (layer defenses), Regenerative Flesh (molt synergy)

**Strategy**: Maximum mutation stacking. Carapace Molt negates big hits. Bloodline Shift for molt reactions. Adaptive Evolution for controlled transformations. Become unkillable mutation engine.
