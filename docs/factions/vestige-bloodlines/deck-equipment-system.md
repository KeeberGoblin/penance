## Design Philosophy

The Vestige Bloodlines are dying. Not slowly, but generationally—each child born more feral than their parents, each generation closer to mindless beasts. They pilot Caskets not for power, but for **survival**—the neural threads are the only thing keeping their minds human and their bodies from transforming into Abominations.

Every card reflects their desperate struggle:

- **Bloodline Identity**: Your curse is inherited—wolf, bear, insect, raven, or serpent
- **Biomass Economy**: Feed the hunger, or lose yourself to it
- **Pack Tactics**: Together, we remember what we were
- **Casket Dependency**: Without the neural threads stabilizing our minds AND bodies, we are just beasts
- **The Extinction Clock**: We have 150 years. Maybe less.

**They are not monsters piloting machines. They are people using machines to stay people.**

## Why Vestige MUST Pilot Caskets

### The Dual Suppression System

Vestige Bloodlines discovered the horrifying truth in Year 85:

**Caskets don't just help them fight. Caskets keep them human.**

**Neural Thread Functions:**
1. **Mental Stabilization**: Preserves coherent thought, prevents feral regression
2. **Mutation Suppression**: Actively halts genetic degradation, freezes transformation
3. **Identity Preservation**: Maintains sense of self against both mental and physical collapse

**Without Caskets:**
- **6-24 hours**: Rapid mutation acceleration—extra limbs, lost limbs, transformative changes
- **24-48 hours**: Point of no return—irreversible metamorphosis into Abomination
- **48+ hours**: No human consciousness remains—pure beast, must be mercy-killed

### The Prison-Lifeline Paradox

**They are not pilots who use Caskets. They are prisoners who need them.**

- **Fenmar**: Disconnect = transform into quadrupedal wolves (lose hands, speech, humanity)
- **Urtok**: Disconnect = hibernate forever (body petrifies into living stone)
- **Vexis**: Disconnect = metamorphosis into mindless insects (hive-absorption)
- **Corvath**: Disconnect = avian devolution (bones hollow until collapse, mind regresses to bird)
- **Serrak**: Disconnect = limbless serpent (arms/legs retract, venom becomes lethal to self)

### The Generational Countdown

**Each generation needs MORE suppression:**
- **1st gen**: Could disconnect for days (72+ hours)
- **2nd gen**: Could disconnect for 48 hours
- **3rd gen**: Can disconnect for 24 hours
- **4th gen**: Can disconnect for 6-12 hours
- **5th gen (predicted)**: Cannot disconnect at all—instant transformation

**Current 4th generation children are born inside Caskets and may never leave.**

### The Strength They Cannot Use

**The cruelest irony:**

Vestige mutations give them **superhuman physical capabilities:**
- Fenmar pack coordination (tactical superiority)
- Urtok strength (can lift 800+ lbs)
- Vexis regeneration (molt healing)
- Corvath mobility (gliding, enhanced senses)
- Serrak toxicity (natural venom weapons)

**But without Caskets, they cannot use any of it.**

A Fenmar disconnected for 18 hours has enhanced strength, speed, senses—**and the mind of a rabid wolf**. Useless.

**They are not weak pilots made strong by Caskets.**
**They are strong beasts made functional by Caskets.**

The Casket is the only thing standing between "super-soldier" and "Abomination."

## MUTATION STRAIN MECHANIC

### The Casket's Limit

**Caskets suppress mutations, but they have limits.** Every time you spend Biomass, you force a controlled mutation. Spend too much, and the suppression fails.

**Tracking:**
- **Mutation Strain Track**: Count total Biomass tokens spent this mission (cumulative, never resets)
- Starts at 0, increases every time you spend Biomass
- Track goes from 0 to 30+

**Thresholds:**

| Strain Level | Status | Effect |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| **0-9** | Stable | Normal operation, no penalties |
| **10-19** | Unstable | All attacks generate +1 Heat (mutations straining Casket systems) |
| **20-29** | Feral | Must attack each turn if able, cannot use Reactive defense cards (beast instinct taking over) |
| **30+** | Transformation | Mission ends immediately, pilot transforms into Abomination, Casket shuts down (**LOSS CONDITION**) |

**Strategic Implications:**
- Early mission: Spend freely (0-9 Strain is safe)
- Mid mission: Risky decisions (10+ Strain = Heat pressure builds)
- Late mission: Desperation (20+ Strain = can't defend, pure aggression)
- **Never exceed 29 Strain** or you lose the mission immediately

**Cards that add Mutation Strain:**
- Bloodline Shift: +2 Strain per use
- Adaptive Evolution: +1 Strain per use
- Regenerative Flesh: +1 Strain per use
- Carapace Molt: +2 Strain per use
- Hibernation Trance: +4 Strain per use
- Reactive Scales (Biomass option): +1 Strain per use

**Thematic justification:**
> "The neural threads can only suppress so much. Every mutation you force brings you closer to the edge. Push too hard, and the Casket loses its grip. The beast wins. You transform. You lose."

## TACTICAL GUIDELINES

### Bloodline Selection
- **Choose based on playstyle:** Fenmar (teamwork), Urtok (tank), Vexis (adaptability), Corvath (mobility), Serrak (control)
- **Team composition:** All-Fenmar team is strongest (pack synergies), but mixed bloodlines offer versatility
- **Bloodline-specific cards:** Some cards require matching primary bloodline (marked with "Requires: [Bloodline]")

### Biomass Economy & Mutation Strain Management

**Critical Rule: Track your Mutation Strain every mission. At 30+, you transform and lose.**

**Generation:**
- Vestige Heritage: 2 Biomass per kill (+1 if prey type matches)
- Devouring Maw: 3 Biomass on kill

**Spending (with Strain costs):**
- Bloodline Shift: 2 Biomass, +2 Strain
- Adaptive Evolution: 1 Biomass, +1 Strain
- Regenerative Flesh: 1 Biomass, +1 Strain
- Reactive Scales (Biomass option): 1 Biomass, +1 Strain
- Carapace Molt (Vexis): 2 Biomass, +2 Strain
- Hibernation Trance (Urtok): 4 Biomass, +4 Strain (once per mission)
- Ancestral Memory: 3 Biomass, +3 Strain

**Strain Budgeting (Critical!):**
- **0-9 Strain (Safe Zone):** Spend freely early mission, no penalties
- **10-19 Strain (Unstable):** +1 Heat on all attacks - plan Heat management
- **20-29 Strain (Feral):** Must attack each turn, no Reactive defenses - finish mission FAST
- **30+ Strain (GAME OVER):** You transform, mission ends, you lose

**Typical Mission Strain Budget:**
- Conservative play: 5-8 Biomass spent (0-9 Strain, safe)
- Aggressive play: 10-15 Biomass spent (10-19 Strain, Unstable but manageable)
- Desperate play: 20-25 Biomass spent (20-29 Strain, Feral - win NOW or lose)
- **NEVER spend 30+ Biomass** in a single mission

**Strategy Examples:**
- **Urtok Tank (low Strain):** 2x Bloodline Shift (4 Strain) + 3x Regenerative Flesh (3 Strain) = 7 Strain total (safe)
- **Adaptive Evolution Spam (high risk):** 10x Adaptive Evolution = 10 Strain (Unstable, +1 Heat pressure)
- **Emergency Urtok Resurrection:** Hibernation Trance (4 Strain) + 2x Shift (4 Strain) + 5x Evolution (5 Strain) = 13 Strain (Unstable)
- **Suicide Build (DO NOT DO):** Hibernation + 5x Shift + 10x Evolution = 29 Strain (Feral, one more use = transformation)

**Optimal Banking:**
- Keep 2-4 Biomass tokens available for emergencies
- Save Strain budget for late-mission desperation plays
- Front-load Bloodline Shifts early (before Unstable threshold)

### Pack Coordination (Fenmar-Specific)
- **Pure Fenmar pack:** +3 damage per attack (Pack Instinct bonus)
- **Alpha's Command:** Use every turn when 2+ Fenmar allies present (+2 movement for wolves)
- **Howl of Remembrance:** Rally scattered wolves, draw cards for each (resource engine)
- **Moonlit Fury:** Use when enemies grouped (mobile hunt-and-strike)

### Survival Tactics (Urtok-Specific)
- **Bloodline Shift (Urtok):** +3 Defense + regenerate when hit (tank form)
- **Hibernation Trance:** Save for 8 cards or fewer (resurrect with 6 cards, +2 Defense permanently)
- **Adaptive Evolution:** Farm damage intentionally (each hit = +1 permanent damage)
- **Regenerative Flesh:** Combine with Hibernation for massive healing (6 + 2-3 cards)

### Mutation Management (Vexis-Specific)
- **Carapace Molt:** Use reactively against 5+ damage attacks (negate + heal 3)
- **Bloodline Shift (Vexis):** +2 Defense + molt reaction once per round
- **Adaptive Evolution:** Use for controlled power spikes (choose mutation timing)
- **Reactive Scales:** Layer defenses (reduce 2-3 damage per attack)

### Hit-and-Run (Corvath-Specific)
- **Omen's Flight:** Glide 4 hexes, ignore terrain, draw 2 cards (mobility + card advantage)
- **Bloodline Shift (Corvath):** +3 movement + gliding (never get caught)
- **Predator's Mark:** Mark before engaging, kite while dealing +2 damage
- **Tracking Scent:** Draw 3 cards if Prey marked (resource engine while hunting)

### Poison Control (Serrak-Specific)
- **Serpent's Coil:** Immobilize + poison (lock down priority targets)
- **Bloodline Shift (Serrak):** ALL attacks poison (2 damage next turn = 100% uptime)
- **Venomous Spit:** Ranged poison (2 immediate + 2 delayed = 4 total)
- **Scent of Blood:** Execute poisoned enemies at 15 HP or fewer

## FACTION RELATIONSHIPS

| Faction | Relationship | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Church of Absolution** | -3 War | Church executes Vestige on sight (Taint corruption = sin) |
| **Verdant Covenant (Elves)** | -1 Distrustful | Elves pity Vestige but can't/won't help (view mutations as "unnatural") |
| **Forge-Guilds (Dwarves)** | 0 Neutral | Dwarves tolerate Vestige if they pay well (pragmatic trade, no emotion) |
| **The Exchange** | +1 Friendly | Exchange deals with anyone who has coin (neutrally amoral) |
| **The Ossuarium** | 0 Neutral | Ossuarium study Vestige mutations (offer dubious "cures" for souls) |
| **The Wyrd Conclave (Fae)** | -2 Hostile | Fae find Vestige "boring" (already cursed, nothing to bargain) |
| **Nomad Collective** | -1 Distrustful | Nomads fear Vestige (superstitious, believe mutations are contagious) |
| **Crucible Packs** | 0 Neutral | Crucible respect Vestige fighting spirit but pity their "dishonor" (unwilling curse) |
| **Emergent Syndicate** | -2 Hostile | Syndicate views Vestige as "failed prototypes" (random mutations vs scientific evolution) |

## DESIGN NOTES

### Balance Considerations
- **Biomass Economy**: Powerful but requires kills (weak if denied)
- **Mutation Strain Cap**: Hard limit at 30 Strain prevents infinite scaling (transformation = loss)
- **Bloodline Dependency**: Many cards require specific bloodlines (limits deck flexibility)
- **Pack Scaling**: Strongest with Vestige allies (weaker in mixed-faction teams)
- **Risk vs Reward**: High damage potential balanced by transformation risk

### Unique Mechanics
- **Bloodline Shift**: 5 unique transformations (unprecedented variety)
- **Pack Instinct**: Scales with Vestige-specific allies (faction-locked synergy)
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Permanent damage scaling (turns defense into offense)
- **Bloodline Bonus**: Prey type matching (strategic target selection)

### Counterplay
- **Against Vestige**: Deny first kill, isolate pack members, anti-synergy tech, area denial
- **Vestige Counters**: Church (Righteous Wrath ignores Defense), Dwarves (Stone Endurance outlasts), Elves (Root Bind prevents Corvath escapes)

---

## CAMPAIGN INTEGRATION

### Early Campaign Hooks
- **Quest**: "The Lost Cub" - Rescue kidnapped Fenmar child from Church Inquisition
- **Quest**: "Bloodline Truce" - Mediate peace between feuding Urtok and Serrak bloodlines
- **Quest**: "The First Memory" - Escort Grendok Urtok to sacred site (uncover Year 0 secrets)

### Mid Campaign Conflicts
- **Faction War**: Church Purification Crusade 2.0 (players must defend Vestige territories)
- **Political Crisis**: Vestige Council debates: Seek cure? Join Syndicate? Accept extinction?
- **Moral Dilemma**: 4th generation Vestige children born as Abominations—mercy kill or raise as weapons?

### Late Campaign Endgame
- **Cure Quest**: Find genetic stabilization method (Elven Worldheart sap? Ossuarium soul-binding? Dwarven runecraft?)
- **Extinction Acceptance**: Grendok's philosophy wins—Vestige peacefully fade into history
- **Syndicate Merger**: Sella Vexis leads Vestige into Emergent Syndicate (controlled evolution)
- **Rebellion Victory**: Kael Fenmar unites all bloodlines, overthrows Church, establishes Vestige nation
