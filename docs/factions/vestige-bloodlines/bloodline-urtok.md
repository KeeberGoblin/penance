## Notable NPC: Grendok Urtok "The Sleeper"

### Title
**Oldest Living Vestige, Keeper of the First Memory**

### Basic Info
- **Age**: 64 (3rd generation—miracle he's alive)
- **Casket**: "The Hibernaculum" (armored den, hibernation life-support systems)
- **Generation**: 3rd (stable but ancient, knows he's the last of his kind)

### Appearance
- **Massive ursine build** (9 feet tall, 800 lbs)
- **Grizzled brown fur** (gray around muzzle, scarred hide)
- **One eye missing** (lost to Church Inquisitor, Year 389)
- **Moves slowly** (age + bear bulk, deliberate movements)
- **Wears no clothing** (believes fur is enough, traditionalist)

### Personality
- **Speaks in slow, measured sentences** (pauses between thoughts)
- **Philosopher-warrior** (meditates for days, contemplates mortality)
- **Detached from modern conflicts** (seen too much death, tired of war)
- **Believes Vestige should embrace extinction peacefully**
- **"We are echoes. Let us fade quietly."** (personal motto)

### Unique Abilities

#### Elder's Torpor (Passive)
When Grendok takes 10+ damage, automatically enter hibernation (cannot act for 1 turn, recover 5 cards, heal all wounds).

#### Unstoppable (Passive)
Cannot be knocked down, immobilized, or stunned (bear endurance).

#### Ancestral Roar (4 SP)
All enemies within 6 hexes have -2 to all rolls for 2 turns (terror effect).

### Backstory
- **Born Year 373**, survived the Exodus as a child (age 7)
- **Witnessed 40+ years** of Vestige persecution
- **Lost entire family** (mate + 3 cubs) to Church purges (Year 412)
- **Now lives in isolation**, only emerges for Vestige Council gatherings
- **Believes fighting is futile**—"We are echoes. Let us fade quietly."
- **Keeps journal** of all Vestige history (oral tradition, carves in stone)

### Campaign Hook
Players can:
- **Convince Grendok to lead Urtok resistance** (requires persuasion, showing hope for cure)
- **Mercy-kill him** if he's suffering (he may request this, "Let me rest")
- **Learn history** from his stone journals (uncover Year 0-373 secrets)

If convinced to fight, Grendok becomes **unstoppable tank ally** but risks death (already 64, beyond natural lifespan).

## Bloodline Mechanics

### Urtok-Specific Bonuses
- **Hibernation Trance (Urtok-only)**: Resurrect at 8 cards or fewer (recover 6 cards, +2 Defense permanently)
- **Bloodline Shift (Urtok form)**: +3 Defense, regenerate 1 card when hit
- **Stone Endurance (Passive)**: Start with +2 max deck size (bear constitution)

### Urtok Transformation (Bloodline Shift)
**Cost**: 2 Biomass tokens  
**Effect**: Transform into enhanced bear form until end of round:
- **+3 Defense** (total Defense can reach 8-10)
- **Regenerate 1 card when hit** (defensive lifesteal)
- **Cannot be pushed or knocked down** (immovable)

### Recommended Deck Build
**Faction Cards (6)**: Vestige Heritage, Bloodline Shift (Urtok form), Hibernation Trance, Adaptive Evolution, Regenerative Flesh, Reactive Scales

**Primary Weapon**: Focus on Frenzy (multi-hit) and Savage Strike (basic consistency)

**Secondary Equipment**: Reactive Scales (layer defenses), Regenerative Flesh (sustain)

**Strategy**: Tank through Bloodline Shift. Adaptive Evolution turns damage into permanent power. Hibernation Trance resurrects at low HP. Outlast enemies through sheer endurance.
