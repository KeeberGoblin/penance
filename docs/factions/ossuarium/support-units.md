# The Ossuarium - Support Units
## Penance: Death, Decay, and Resurrection

**Version**: 3.0 Equipment System (Asymmetric)
**Date**: October 16, 2025

The Ossuarium fields undead thralls, bone constructs, and necromantic abominations. Each unit embodies death and decay, with abilities to resurrect, drain life, and spread corruption.

---

## OSSUARIUM SUPPORT UNITS OVERVIEW

**Faction-Specific Units** (Choose 1):
1. Bone Thrall Swarm (2 Equipment Slots)
2. Grave Knight (3 Equipment Slots)
3. Fleshcrafter (2 Equipment Slots)

**Note**: Ossuarium doctrine emphasizes three pillars of undeath: endless swarms that never stay dead, elite warriors empowered by souls, and grotesque necromancy. These 3 units represent core Ossuarium philosophy: attrition warfare through resurrection.

---

**Category**: Infantry (Swarm/Disposable)
**HP**: 12 (3 HP per thrall, 4 thralls total) | **Movement**: 4 | **Defense**: 0
**Equipment Slots**: 2
**Theme**: Expendable skeleton swarm that reforms and multiplies

### Visual Description
Four humanoid skeletons in tattered grave shrouds, armed with rusted weapons. Their bones are held together by necrotic energy - visible green threads of magic pulse through hollow eye sockets. They move with eerie coordination, chattering their teeth in unison.

## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Units?
Ossuarium doctrine emphasizes three pillars of undeath. These 3 units represent:
- **Bone Thrall Swarm**: Endless horde (quantity over quality, infinite resurrection)
- **Grave Knight**: Elite undead warrior (soul harvesting, lifesteal dominance)
- **Fleshcrafter**: Grotesque necromancy (healing allies, creating abominations)

Each unit offers distinct tactical approach while maintaining Ossuarium identity: nothing stays dead, attrition warfare, and horrifying body horror.
