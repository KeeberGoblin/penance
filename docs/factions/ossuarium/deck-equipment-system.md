# The Ossuarium - Equipment Slot System
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Version**: v5.29-FINAL (Taint Warfare System)
**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025

---

## Faction Identity

**The Ossuarium** - Necromantic attrition warfare through Taint corruption
- **Philosophy**: "Death is not the end. It is merely a change in employment."
- **Playstyle**: Taint corruption, Thrall summoning, resurrection mechanics, inevitable grinding
- **Signature Mechanic**: Decay Aura (spread Taint to enemies) + Phylactery (resurrection)

**CRITICAL v5.23 CHANGE**: Lifesteal mechanics completely removed. Ossuarium no longer recovers cards from dealing damage. Current mechanics focus on Taint penalties, skeletal minions, and attrition warfare.

---

## v5.29-FINAL Core Mechanics

### Decay Aura (Passive - Primary Win Condition)
All enemies within 3 hexes gain +1 Taint at the start of your turn. Permanent corruption that stacks infinitely (max 10).

**Taint Penalty Scale (v5.25)**:
- **1-2 Taint**: +1 Heat at turn start
- **3-4 Taint**: +1 Heat, 1 card destroyed per turn
- **5-7 Taint**: +2 Heat, 1 card destroyed per turn
- **8-10 Taint**: +2 Heat, 2 cards destroyed per turn

### Phylactery (Passive - Resurrection)
First time each mission you reach 0 HP, automatically resurrect at 5 HP. Forces enemies to kill you twice.

### Raise Dead (Summon - Action Economy)
Summon Skeletal Thralls (1 HP, 2 damage melee minions). Create 3-6 Thralls for overwhelming action economy.

### Necrotic Resilience (Passive - Death Spiral)
Ossuarium uses Decay cards instead of Damage cards on reshuffle (0 SP cost, discard to lose 1 SP). Slower death than other factions.

---

---

## FACTION STRENGTHS

- Inevitable win condition (Taint cannot be cleansed in v5.29)
- Extreme survivability (Phylactery + Necrotic Resilience + accessories)
- Action economy dominance (6-8 Thralls = 12-16 damage/turn)
- No reliance on allies (all mechanics self-contained)
- Passive damage (Decay Aura works automatically)
- Resurrection mechanics (forces enemy to kill you 2-3 times)
- Death spiral mitigation (Decay cards better than Damage cards)

**BALANCE NOTE (v5.29-FINAL)**:
- Taint cannot be removed or cleansed (permanent corruption)
- Phylactery only triggers once per mission (prevents infinite resurrection)
- Thralls cap at 4-8 depending on tactics (prevents overwhelming swarms)

---

## FACTION WEAKNESSES

1. **Slow Win Condition**: Taint takes 5-10 turns to kill. Church burst can win turn 2.
2. **No Card Recovery**: Zero healing. Damage is permanent (except Phylactery resurrection).
3. **Thralls Fragile**: 1 HP minions die to AoE (without Thrall Empowerment accessories).
4. **Melee Focused**: Nomads can kite forever with 8 movement + ranged attacks.
5. **One Resurrection**: After Phylactery triggers, no safety net (unless accessories provide extras).
6. **Vulnerable to Burst**: High-damage alpha strikes can kill through Phylactery cooldown.
7. **SP Intensive**: Summoning Thralls (2-3 SP each) drains resources quickly.

---

## TACTICAL TIPS

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
- Position within 3 hexes of enemies to start Decay Aura stacking
- Summon 1-2 Thralls for early board presence
- Use Bone Wand ranged attacks to poke while spreading Taint
- Save Phylactery for when you're below 10 HP (don't waste it)
- Focus on positioning, not kills (Taint does the work)

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
- Enemies should have 3-5 Taint by now (Heat + card destruction begins)
- Summon additional Thralls if you have Thrall Commander (reach 4-6 minions)
- Start using Mass Corruption to accelerate Taint on key targets
- If Phylactery triggers, use Grave Resurrection to flood the board
- Trade HP for positioning (you can resurrect, they can't)

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
- Enemies at 8-10 Taint are losing 2 cards/turn + 2 Heat
- Their decks are in death spiral, their SP is crippled
- Focus on survival, not aggression (Taint finishes for you)
- If enemy tries desperate alpha strike, Phylactery saves you
- Thralls clean up weakened enemies while Decay Aura caps them

---

## COUNTER-PLAY (How to Beat Ossuarium)

- **Rush them down early** (Turns 1-3, before Taint stacks)
- **Burst damage through Phylactery** (kill them twice in one turn if possible)
- **Kill Thralls immediately** (deny action economy advantage)
- **Kite and range** (stay outside 3-hex Decay Aura range)
- **AoE attacks** (kill multiple Thralls per action)
- **Destroy their Primary Weapon** (no weapon = slower Taint spreading)
- **Inflict Pilot Wounds** (disrupts their long-game plan)
- **Play aggressively** (defensive play lets Taint stack to critical mass)

**Key Insight**: Ossuarium gets stronger every turn. Win fast or lose to inevitable Taint.

---

## CAMPAIGN PROGRESSION

### Starting Loadout (Mission 1)
- Weapon: Bone Wand (4 Scrap to craft)
- Offhand: Necrotic Focus (2 Scrap to craft)
- Accessory: None (can't afford yet)
- **Total: 6 Scrap investment**
- **Tactics**: Necrotic Surge + Death's Patience

### Mid-Campaign (Mission 5-10)
- Upgrade to Staff of the Grave or Necromancer's Grimoire
- Add Death Mask Relic (5 Scrap, faction-exclusive - doubles Decay Aura)
- Add Phylactery Shard (4 Scrap - improved resurrection)
- **Tactics**: Switch to Legion Command + Inevitable Death (if playing Thrall build)

### Late-Campaign (Mission 15+)
- Acquire looted cross-faction equipment (Dwarven armor, Elven bow)
- Upgrade to Heavy or Fortress Casket (more accessory slots for survivability)
- Stack Phylactery Shard + Thrall Commander + Death Mask
- **Tactics**: Grave Resurrection + Legion Command (maximum post-death swarm)

---

## Balance Notes (v5.29-FINAL)

**Current WR**: 48.9% (Tier A - Balanced)

**Balance Journey**:
- v5.21: 84.4% WR (lifesteal overpowered)
- v5.23: 62.2% WR (lifesteal completely removed → Taint-only)
- v5.29: 48.9% WR (stable production balance)

**Key Insight**: Removing lifesteal entirely was the only viable balance solution. Incremental nerfs failed because lifesteal synergized too well with attrition. Current Taint-only design is slower but healthier.

**Playtesting Feedback**: Ossuarium creates dramatic moments (Phylactery resurrections, Thrall sacrifices, Taint reaching critical mass). Forces interesting decisions: kill Thralls or main Casket? Rush down or let Taint spread? Win before Turn 10 or lose to corruption?

## VERSION 3.0 OPTIONAL RULES

### Ossuarium Interactions with Taint Exploitation

**Taint Philosophy**: Ossuarium pilots **weaponize Taint as a tool**. They spread corruption but resist it through necromantic conditioning.

**Faction Bonuses**:
- **Necrotic Conditioning**: Ossuarium pilots start with **Grit 1** (instead of Grit 0)
- **Corruption Immunity**: Ossuarium pilots are immune to Taint penalties up to **5 Taint** (Death's Patience passive built-in)
- **Taint Weaponization**: Ossuarium can spend enemy Taint to fuel their own abilities

**Ossuarium-Specific Taint Cards** (if using Taint Exploitation):
- **Mass Corruption**: Now also grants you +1 Taint when cast (fuel for abilities)
- **Inevitable Death**: Costs 3 Taint instead of 4 SP (spend Taint as resource)
- **Necrotic Surge**: Gain 4 SP + spend 2 Taint for additional 2 SP (total 6 SP burst)

**Taint Necromancer Build**:
1. Spread Taint to all enemies with Decay Aura (reach 5-7 Taint each)
2. Spend enemy Taint to fuel Inevitable Death (burst +3 Taint to all)
3. Enemies hit critical mass (8-10 Taint) while you stay at 5 Taint (safe zone)
4. Use Necrotic Surge to convert your own Taint into SP burst
5. Phylactery ensures you survive to late game

**Strategic Use**: Ossuarium operates as "Taint battery" - accumulate it safely (up to 5), spend it offensively (enemy Taint as resource), spread it rapidly (Decay Aura), and outlast through resurrection (Phylactery).

---

### Ossuarium Pilot Grit System

**Starting Grit**: **1** (Necrotic Conditioning)
- All Ossuarium pilots start at Grit 1 (instead of Grit 0)
- Represents undead tolerance and pain immunity training
- Necromancers are conditioned to resist physical trauma

**Grit Progression**:
- Mission 5: Grit 2 (instead of requiring 10 missions)
- Mission 15: Grit 3 (instead of requiring 20 missions)
- Fast-track: Survive Phylactery resurrection → immediate Grit 2

**Grit Check Example** (Ossuarium Pilot, Grit 2):
```
Trigger: Component Destruction (Right Arm destroyed)
Roll: 1d6 + 2 Grit = 6
Result: Tough It Out (Severe Injury becomes Minor)
Outcome: Ossuarium pilot's necrotic conditioning prevents permanent injury
```

**Thematic Fit**: Ossuarium pilots are literally undead or necromancers. They don't feel pain like living pilots. Physical trauma barely registers. They start tougher and improve faster through exposure to death (Phylactery resurrection grants Grit bonus).

**Special Rule**: When Phylactery triggers (you resurrect from 0 HP), immediately gain +1 Grit for the rest of the mission (dying makes you stronger, thematically fitting).

---

## FINAL REMINDER

This document describes **v5.29-FINAL mechanics**. Any references to:
- Soul Harvest
- Corpse Fuel
- Lifesteal
- Card recovery from damage

...are **outdated and incorrect**. Ossuarium is now a pure attrition faction winning through Taint warfare and Thrall swarms, not sustain.

For complete card list, see: `/docs/cards/complete-card-data.json` (ossuarium section, updated October 21, 2025)

**END OF DOCUMENT**

*"Death is patient. Death is inevitable. Death is merely the beginning."*
