## Faction Identity

**The Ossuarium** - Necromantic resource vampires
- **Philosophy**: "Death is not the end. It is merely a change in employment."
- **Playstyle**: Lifesteal, corpse exploitation, resurrection mechanics, inevitable grinding

## Deck Composition Formula

**Variable Deck Size = 10 Universal Core + 6 Ossuarium Core + X Equipment + 2 Tactics**

---

## DECAY MECHANIC (Replaces Damage Cards)

**The Ossuarium does NOT add "Damage" cards on reshuffle.**

Instead, they add **"Decay" cards**:

**Decay Card**:
- **Type**: Curse
- **SP Cost**: 0
- **Effect**: Discard this card. Lose 1 SP this turn. Gain 1 Heat.
- **Flavor**: *"Even the undead rot."*

**Why Different?**
- Decay cards slow you down but don't dead-draw
- You can still play them (discard for minor penalty)
- Thematic: undead degrade over time but never fully "die"
- Balancing: Ossuarium has strong lifesteal, Decay prevents infinite sustain

---

## FACTION STRENGTHS

- Best lifesteal in game (multiple cards recover HP)
- Resurrection mechanics (Phylactery + Undying Resilience = 2 lives)
- Corpse exploitation (gain resources from enemy deaths)
- Inevitable grinding (outlast through constant healing)
- Minion summoning (action economy advantage)

---

## FACTION WEAKNESSES

- Reliant on dealing damage to heal (if prevented from attacking, cannot sustain)
- Weak to burst damage (must kill enemies to recover, can't prevent initial hits)
- Decay cards slow late-game (multiple reshuffles = multiple Decay cards)
- Minions are fragile (Thralls die easily, 1 HP each)
- Requires kills to function optimally (Corpse Fuel, Bone Armor trigger on deaths)

---

## TACTICAL TIPS

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
- Soul Harvest every turn (consistent lifesteal)
- Position aggressively (need to hit enemies to heal)
- Don't waste Phylactery resurrection early (save for late-game)

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)
- Kill weakened enemies to trigger Corpse Fuel (5 cards per kill)
- Summon Thralls if using Raise Dead (meatshields buy time)
- Stack Bone Armor if taken (each kill = +1 permanent Defense)

### Late Game (Turns 7+)
- Phylactery triggers automatically (first death = resurrect at 5 HP)
- Undying Resilience triggers next (second death = resurrect at 10 HP)
- Decay cards accumulate (2-3 reshuffles = 2-3 Decay cards in deck)
- Eternal Hunger doubles lifesteal (recover massive HP per hit)

---

## COUNTER-PLAY (How to Beat Ossuarium)

- Prevent them from attacking (control, stuns, disarms)
- Burst damage overwhelms lifesteal (kill before they heal)
- Destroy minions immediately (don't let Thralls accumulate)
- Target Phylactery Relic (destroy their resurrection insurance)
- Keep them away from corpses (deny Corpse Fuel triggers)
- Inflict Pilot Wounds that prevent healing

---

## CAMPAIGN PROGRESSION

### Starting Loadout (Mission 1)
- Weapon: Bone Scythe (5 Scrap)
- Offhand: Buckler Shield (2 Scrap)
- Accessory: Death Mark Sigil (5 Scrap, faction-exclusive)
- **Total: 12 Scrap investment** (expensive but self-sustaining)

### Mid-Campaign (Mission 5-10)
- Add Phylactery Relic (6 Scrap) for resurrection
- Add Repair Sigil (3 Scrap) for extra healing
- Upgrade to Phylarch or Bonelord (more accessory slots)

### Late-Campaign (Mission 15+)
- Stack lifesteal accessories (Death Mark + Repair Sigil + Phylactery)
- Acquire Summoning Staff if using minion build
- Take Undying Resilience Tactic (two resurrections)
- Become unkillable endgame boss

## VERSION 3.0 OPTIONAL RULES

### Ossuarium Interactions with Taint Exploitation

**Taint Philosophy**: Ossuarium **thrives on Taint**. They are already dead - corruption is power.

**Faction Bonuses**:
- **Already Dead**: Gain Taint normally
- **Soul Harvest Synergy**: "Soul Harvest" card now costs **2 Taint** to activate, recovers 3 cards
- **Decay Aura**: Enemies within 3 hexes gain +1 Taint per turn (passive corruption field)
- **Corruption Resistance**: Corruption Save is **5+ instead of 4+** (83% resistant)

**Ossuarium-Specific Taint Uses**:
- Spend 2 Taint → Soul Harvest (recover 3 cards from discard)
- Spend 3 Taint → Bone Reconstruction (remove 1 Component Damage)
- Spend 4 Taint → Raise Dead (summon 1 Bone Thrall support unit)

**Strategic Use**: Ossuarium operates best at 5-7 Taint constantly. Use Decay Aura to corrupt enemies, then exploit their Taint offensively. Spend own Taint for Soul Harvest recursion. Very hard to corrupt (5+ save).

---

### Ossuarium Pilot Grit System

**Starting Grit**: **IMMUNE** (does not use Grit system)
**Alternative**: Ossuarium uses **Decay Card system** instead of Pilot Wounds

**Why Immune**: Ossuarium pilots are already dead (reanimated corpses). They don't take Pilot Wounds or flip Wound cards. Instead, they use faction-specific Decay mechanic.

**Decay System** (replaces Grit):
- When Ossuarium would take Pilot Damage, add 1 Decay card to deck (instead of flipping Wound)
- Decay cards have negative effects when drawn (similar to Damage cards but worse)
- Max 10 Decay cards (pilot "dies" again when 10 Decay accumulated)

**Thematic Fit**: You can't wound the dead. Ossuarium pilots decay over time instead of taking injuries.

---

**END OF DOCUMENT - v3.0 ENHANCED**

*"We died once. The Engine brought us back. Taint is our lifeblood. We embrace the rot."*
