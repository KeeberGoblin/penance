# The Ossuarium - Equipment Slot System
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Version**: v5.29-FINAL (Taint Warfare System)
**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025

---

## Faction Identity

**The Ossuarium** - Necromantic attrition warfare through Taint corruption
- **Philosophy**: "Death is not the end. It is merely a change in employment."
- **Playstyle**: Taint corruption, Thrall summoning, resurrection mechanics, inevitable grinding
- **Signature Mechanic**: Decay Aura (spread Taint to enemies) + Phylactery (resurrection)

**CRITICAL v5.23 CHANGE**: Lifesteal mechanics completely removed. Ossuarium no longer recovers cards from dealing damage. Current mechanics focus on Taint penalties, skeletal minions, and attrition warfare.

## v5.29-FINAL Core Mechanics

### Decay Aura (Passive - Primary Win Condition)
All enemies within 3 hexes gain +1 Taint at the start of your turn. Permanent corruption that stacks infinitely (max 10).

**Taint Penalty Scale (v5.25)**:
- **1-2 Taint**: +1 Heat at turn start
- **3-4 Taint**: +1 Heat, 1 card destroyed per turn
- **5-7 Taint**: +2 Heat, 1 card destroyed per turn
- **8-10 Taint**: +2 Heat, 2 cards destroyed per turn

### Phylactery (Passive - Resurrection)
First time each mission you reach 0 HP, automatically resurrect at 5 HP. Forces enemies to kill you twice.

### Raise Dead (Summon - Action Economy)
Summon Skeletal Thralls (1 HP, 2 damage melee minions). Create 3-6 Thralls for overwhelming action economy.

### Necrotic Resilience (Passive - Death Spiral)
Ossuarium uses Decay cards instead of Damage cards on reshuffle (0 SP cost, discard to lose 1 SP). Slower death than other factions.

## Deck Composition

**Formula**: 10 Universal Core + 6 Ossuarium Core + X Equipment + 2 Tactics

Choose 6 faction cards from 21 available. Recommended core:
1. Decay Aura (passive Taint spreading)
2. Phylactery (resurrection)
3. Raise Dead (summon Thralls)
4. Bone Scythe Strike (5-7 damage with Taint synergy)
5. Deathless Advance (movement + damage cap)
6. Mass Corruption (AoE Taint application)

---

## Equipment Recommendations

### Weapons

**BONE WAND** (6-8 cards) - Ranged Taint Spreader
- Death Ray: 4 damage ranged, +1 Taint
- Necrotic Bolt: 3 damage ranged
- Thrall Summon: Summon from distance

**NECROMANCER'S GRIMOIRE** (6-8 cards) - AoE & Summoning
- Mass Raise: Summon 2 Thralls
- Taint Wave: 2 damage AoE, +2 Taint to all hit
- Death March Tactic: Thralls +2 movement

**STAFF OF THE GRAVE** (6-8 cards) - Melee Powerhouse
- Reaper Strike: 5 damage melee, +2 Taint
- Grave Slam: 6 damage AoE, +1 Taint
- Phylactery Ward: Negate lethal (stacks with Phylactery)

### Accessories

**DEATH MASK RELIC** (3 cards) - CRITICAL
- Taint Amplifier: Decay Aura gives +2 Taint instead of +1 (doubles effectiveness!)
- Necrotic Burst: 3 damage AoE, +3 Taint
- Fear Aura: Enemies -1 to attack

**PHYLACTERY SHARD** (3 cards)
- Second Life: Resurrect at 8 HP instead of 5
- Death Defiance: Negate 1 lethal attack
- Soul Anchor: +3 max HP

**THRALL COMMANDER SIGIL** (3 cards)
- Thrall Empowerment: Thralls have 3 HP instead of 1
- Legion: Summon 3 Thralls at once
- Death Swarm: Max 6 Thralls instead of 4

## Sample Build: "Taint Bomber"

**Casket**: Revenant Scout (6 SP)
**Equipment**: Bone Wand (6), Death Mask Relic (3), Phylactery Shard (3)
**Tactics**: Necrotic Surge, Death's Patience
**Total**: 30 cards

**Strategy**: Kite with 6 movement, spread Decay Aura amplified by Death Mask (+2 Taint/turn). By turn 5, enemies have 10 Taint = losing 2 cards/turn + 2 Heat. Their decks collapse while you stay safe at range. Three lives (Phylactery base + Death Defiance + Second Life).

**Win Rate vs Meta**: 48.9% (balanced, production-ready)

---

## Sample Build: "Thrall Swarm"

**Casket**: Lich Heavy (4 SP)
**Equipment**: Staff of Grave (8), Thrall Commander Sigil (3), Offhand Grimoire (4)
**Total**: 36 cards

**Strategy**: Summon 6-7 Thralls by turn 4 (Raise Dead + Mass Raise + Legion). Thralls with 3 HP survive enemy AoE. Command 7 minions = 14 damage/turn while Decay Aura stacks. Overwhelming action economy.

---

## Weaknesses

1. **Slow Win Condition**: Taint takes 5-10 turns to kill. Church burst can win turn 2.
2. **No Card Recovery**: Zero healing. Damage is permanent (except Phylactery).
3. **Thralls Fragile**: 1 HP minions die to AoE (without Thrall Empowerment).
4. **Melee Focused**: Nomads can kite forever with 8 movement + ranged.
5. **One Resurrection**: After Phylactery, no safety net (unless accessories enhance it).

## Balance Notes (v5.29-FINAL)

**Current WR**: 48.9% (Tier A - Balanced)

**Balance Journey**:
- v5.21: 84.4% WR (lifesteal overpowered)
- v5.23: 62.2% WR (lifesteal completely removed â†’ Taint-only)
- v5.29: 48.9% WR (stable production balance)

**Key Insight**: Removing lifesteal entirely was the only viable balance solution. Incremental nerfs failed because lifesteal synergized too well with attrition. Current Taint-only design is slower but healthier.

**Playtesting Feedback**: Ossuarium creates dramatic moments (Phylactery resurrections, Thrall sacrifices, Taint reaching critical mass). Forces interesting decisions: kill Thralls or main Casket? Rush down or let Taint spread? Win before Turn 10 or lose to corruption?

## FINAL REMINDER

This document describes **v5.29-FINAL mechanics**. Any references to:
- Soul Harvest
- Corpse Fuel
- Lifesteal
- Card recovery from damage

...are **outdated and incorrect**. Ossuarium is now a pure attrition faction winning through Taint warfare and Thrall swarms, not sustain.
