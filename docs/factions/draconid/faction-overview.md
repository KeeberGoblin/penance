# The Draconid Remembrance
## Faction Overview - NPC Faction (Event-Based Encounters Only)

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: NPC-ONLY FACTION (Not Playable - Event Encounters Only)

---

## Design Philosophy

The Draconid Remembrance is **not a playable faction**. Instead, they serve as:
- **Lore keepers**: Ancient beings who remember previous Cataclysms
- **Rare NPC encounters**: Event-based meetings, quest givers, optional bosses
- **Campaign wildcards**: Can be allies or antagonists depending on player choices
- **Living history**: Walking repositories of pre-Cataclysm knowledge

**Players cannot build Draconid decks**. Instead, Draconids appear as:
- Event table results (rare encounters)
- Quest-giver NPCs
- Optional boss fights (if players antagonize them)
- Potential hirelings (for astronomical prices in knowledge/artifacts)

---

## Faction Identity

### Core Concept
**"We've Seen This Before"**

The Draconids are descendants of ancient dragons who witnessed **three previous Cataclysms**. They're fatalistic scholars who view the current Sundering as just another cycle of hubris → collapse → rebuilding. They pilot Caskets built from **fossilized dragon remains** and live in mountain fortress-cities built into ancient dragon lairs.

### Philosophy
- **History is cyclical**: Rise → hubris → Cataclysm → dark age → rise again
- **Knowledge is immortality**: The only thing that survives apocalypses is memory
- **Detachment from mortal concerns**: When you've lived through three world-endings, current politics seem trivial
- **Preservation over interference**: They record history, they don't try to change it (anymore)

## Origins & History

### The First Cataclysm (Year -2,400, Old Calendar)
**The Flood**

Dragons remember the world before humanity, when the planet was ruled by elemental titans. The First Cataclysm was a flood that drowned 90% of landmass. Dragons survived by flight. Titans did not.

**Soulstone Discovery**: First crystalline formations appeared after the Flood. Dragons hoarded them instinctively.

### The Second Cataclysm (Year -1,200, Old Calendar)
**The Inferno**

An ancient civilization (predating humans) discovered fire magic and weaponized it. The resulting magical arms race ignited the atmosphere. Global firestorms consumed forests and boiled oceans.

Dragons survived in deep caves. The fire-civilization did not.

**Soulstone Mutation**: Stones began absorbing ambient magical energy, becoming power sources.

### The Third Cataclysm (Year 0 - The Sundering)
**The Void Breach**

Dr. Nikolas Theslar activated the Theslar Engine, tearing open dimensional barriers. Void energy flooded reality. Civilizations collapsed. This is the current era.

Dragons retreated to the **Dragon Peaks**—high-altitude fortress-cities where Void corruption is thinner (less dense atmosphere).

**Draconid Response**: "We told them not to. They didn't listen. As always."

---

## Territory: The Dragon Peaks

### Skyhold, the Last Roost (Capital)
- Built into ancient dragon's corpse (literal fossilized mountain-sized dragon)
- Population: ~3,000 Draconids + scholars from other factions
- Largest pre-Cataclysm library in existence (vaults sealed against Void corruption)
- **Neutral territory**: Scholars of any faction can access archives (for a price)

### Other Fortress-Cities
- **Wyrm's Rest**: Monastery-archive focusing on cosmology and Void research
- **Crimson Vault**: Military outpost, trains elite Casket pilots
- **The Bone Library**: Medical research center (dragon physiology + Casket fusion studies)

---

## Draconid Physiology

### What Are Draconids?

**Not** dragons. **Not** entirely human. **Hybrid descendants**.

When dragons mated with humanoid species (elves, humans, dwarves) over millennia, offspring inherited draconic traits:
- **Scaled skin** (patches on arms, neck, face - varying coverage)
- **Draconic eyes** (slit pupils, gold/silver/red irises)
- **Extended lifespan** (200-400 years average)
- **Elemental resistance** (heat, cold, or lightning depending on dragon lineage)
- **Draconic pride** (arrogance is genetic)

**Disadvantages**:
- **Sterility** (90% of Draconids cannot reproduce - species is dying out)
- **Hoarding instinct** (compulsive need to collect artifacts, knowledge, wealth)
- **Void sensitivity** (draconic heritage makes them more vulnerable to Taint)

---

## Casket Design: Dragonbone Constructs

Draconid Caskets are **living reliquaries**, incorporating:
- **Fossilized dragon bones** as structural framework (millennia-old remains)
- **Dragon heart Soulstones** (crystallized hearts of dead dragons—the most powerful Soulstones)
- **Scale plating** (actual dragon scales, harder than steel)
- **Claw-tipped limbs** (articulated fossilized claws as weapons)
- **Breath weapon cores** (replicated dragon elemental breath using Soulstone reactors)

**Aesthetic**: Gothic cathedral meets paleontology museum. Draconid Caskets look like **armored skeletons of ancient beasts**, with visible ribs, spinal columns, and wing-bone struts.

---

## Faction Mechanics (For NPCs Only)

### Draconic Heritage (Passive)
- **Elemental Resistance**: Choose Fire, Cold, or Lightning. Reduce damage of that type by 50%.
- **Ancient Knowledge**: Can read pre-Cataclysm texts, access locked archives, identify artifacts instantly.
- **Hoarding Compulsion**: Must succeed on Willpower check (TN 4+) to give away artifacts or wealth.

### Breath Weapon (Variable SP, Attack)
**Fire Breath** (3 SP): Deal 4 damage in 4-hex cone. Targets on fire take 2 damage at start of next turn.
**Frost Breath** (3 SP): Deal 3 damage in 4-hex cone. Slow targets (-1 movement for 2 turns).
**Lightning Breath** (4 SP): Deal 5 damage in straight 6-hex line. Ignore cover.

### Dragon Heart Soulstone (Passive)
- Draconid Caskets have **+5 HP** compared to equivalent weight class (dragon heart cores are superior power sources).
- **Drawback**: When destroyed, Dragon Heart explodes for 6 damage in 2-hex radius (dangerous to allies).

### Ancestral Memory (2 SP, Utility)
- Access racial memory to gain insight into enemy tactics, artifact history, or location secrets.
- GM reveals one useful truth (lore, weakness, or location clue).
- Can only be used once per mission.

## Notable NPCs

### 1. Duskwind the Chronicler
**Archetype**: Ancient Draconid, Fatalistic Scholar, Apocalypse Veteran

**Age**: 437 years old (yes, same age as the Sundering—he witnessed it happen)

**Physical Description**:
- Gold-scaled skin covering 60% of his body (arms, neck, half his face)
- One human eye (blue), one dragon eye (molten gold)
- Hunched from centuries of record-keeping (spinal curvature from leaning over texts)
- Claws instead of fingernails (can't retract them—needs assistants to turn pages)
- Speaks in overlapping echoes (vocal cords partially draconic, produces harmonics)

**Casket**: **"The Ossuary Chronicle"** (1,300 lbs)
- Built from the skeleton of his ancestor-dragon, Vyrnathrax the Witness
- Ribcage chassis with visible spinal column
- Carries massive fossilized tome welded to left arm (actual stone book - 500 lbs)

- **Paradoxically helpful**: Will aid players despite believing their cause is doomed ("You'll fail, but I admire the effort")
- **Obsessive chronicler**: Records EVERYTHING, even mid-combat

**Twist**: Duskwind isn't trying to prevent the fourth Cataclysm—he's **engineering it**. He believes the cycle is broken (previous collapses led to renewal; this one led to stagnation). He wants to "reset the clock" properly this time.

**Unique Ability**: **Cyclical Revelation** (0 SP, Passive)
- Once per mission, Duskwind can declare, "I've seen this before."
- He gains perfect knowledge of enemy tactics for 1 round (knows all cards in enemy hand, knows optimal counter-moves).

## Using Draconids in Campaigns

### Event Encounters (Rare - Roll 95+ on d100)

**1. The Chronicler's Request**
Duskwind seeks players to test a theory: "I need you to survive an impossible situation. For science."
- Reward: Knowledge of upcoming threat, access to Skyhold archives
- Risk: Duskwind's "tests" have 40% mortality rate

**2. Library Under Siege**
Vestige Bloodlines raiders attack Skyhold's archives. Rhysal hires players as guards.
- Reward: Choice of rare artifact or ancient map

**3. The Duelist's Challenge**
Drakthar appears and challenges strongest player pilot to honorable combat.
- Win: Gain Drakthar as ally for 1 mission

**4. The Fourth Cycle**
Duskwind has located a "resonance point" where fourth Cataclysm could be triggered. Offers to show players.
- Choice: Help him trigger it (reset the cycle) OR stop him (preserve current world)

- **First Encounter**: Rhysal appears as quest-giver (retrieve lost text)
- **Reward**: Access to basic archive (lore dumps, world-building exposition)

### Mid Game (Levels 4-6)
- **Duskwind Introduction**: Chronicler approaches players, fascinated by their "unique trajectory through fate"

---

## Design Notes

**Why NPC-Only?**
- Draconids are **too powerful** as playable faction (Dragon Heart Soulstones, Breath Weapons, extended lifespans)
- Their **fatalistic philosophy** doesn't fit player-driven heroism
- They serve better as **quest-givers and lore dispensers** than protagonists
- Making them rare preserves their **mystique and impact**

**Balancing NPC Encounters**:
- Draconid NPCs should feel **powerful but not invincible**
- Give players chances to **earn respect** through clever tactics or honorable conduct
- Draconids **never fight to the death** (too pragmatic - will retreat at 30% HP)
- Their knowledge is the real reward, not their defeat

*"We've watched civilizations rise from ash three times before. We'll watch you do it again. Or we'll watch you fail. Either way, we'll be here to record it."* — Duskwind the Chronicler
