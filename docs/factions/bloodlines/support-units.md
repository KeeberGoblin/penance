### Visual Description
Seven twisted canines - too large, too intelligent, too aggressive. Matted fur covers chitinous plates. Eyes glow with unnatural hunger.

## ASYMMETRIC DESIGN NOTES

### Why Only 3 Faction Units + 2 Neutral?
Vestige doctrine is "evolve or die." They have:
- **3 Core Units**: Pack hunters, evolutionary tanks, spawners
- **2 Neutral Units**: Available to all factions, but require Biomass (Vestige currency)

### Faction Advantage
Vestige generates Biomass easily (harvest from corpses), making Neutral Mercenaries more accessible to them than other factions.

---
