## TURN STRUCTURE REMINDER

### Round Structure
Each **Round** consists of:
1. **Player 1 Turn** (4 phases: Refresh, Action, Draw, End)
2. **Player 2 Turn** (4 phases: Refresh, Action, Draw, End)
3. **End of Round Control Check**

### Control Check (End of Round)
After both players complete their turns:
1. Check Reliquary occupation (who's standing on which hexes?)
2. Award control points:
   - R1 (North): 1 point per hex (max 2)
   - R2 (East/West): 1 point per hex (max 2)
   - R3 (Central Cathedral): 2 points if ANY hex occupied
   - R4 (South): 1 point per hex (max 2)
   - R5 (Far South): 1 point per hex (max 2)
3. Check victory: Does anyone have 6+ points?

**Example Control Check**:
- Church occupies: R1 (1 hex), R2 (2 hexes), R3 (1 hex in 4-hex zone)
  - R1: 1 point
  - R2: 2 points
  - R3: 2 points (full Cathedral bonus)
  - **Total: 5 points**
- Dwarves occupy: R4 (2 hexes), R5 (1 hex)
  - R4: 2 points
  - R5: 1 point
  - **Total: 3 points**
- **Church ahead 5-3, but needs 6+ to win (continue playing)**

---

## COMBAT RESOLUTION (SAME AS SCENARIO #1)

### Attack Steps
1. **Declare attack**: Play attack card, spend SP
2. **Check range**: Is target in range?
3. **Check LOS**: Can you see target? (Pillars block LOS entirely)
4. **Calculate damage**:
   - Base damage (from card)
   - + Facing modifier (Rear +2, Side +1, Front +0)
   - + Elevation modifier (E2 +2)
   - - Defense modifiers (cover, buffs, terrain)
5. **Apply damage**: Defender discards X cards from top of deck

### Component Damage
When you discard cards from damage:
1. Count how many **Primary Weapon cards** were discarded
2. Each Primary Weapon card = 1 **Component Damage**
3. Track Component Damage by location (Arms, Legs, Head, Chassis)
4. When **3 Component Damage** to same location = **Component Destroyed**

---

## VICTORY CONDITIONS

### Primary Victory: Majority Control (6+ Points)
At the end of any Round, if you control 6+ out of 10 total points, you win immediately.

**Point Distribution**:
- North Shrines (R1): 2 points max
- East/West Shrines (R2): 2 points max
- Central Cathedral (R3): 2 points max
- South Shrines (R4): 2 points max
- Far South Shrines (R5): 2 points max
- **Total: 10 points**

**Majority**: 6+ points = 60%+ control

### Secondary Victory: Deathmatch (0 HP)
If opponent's deck is empty AND they cannot reshuffle (discard pile also empty), they are defeated.

### Tertiary Victory: Cathedral Dominance (3 Consecutive Rounds)
If you control Central Cathedral (R3) for **3 consecutive Rounds**, you win via sacred dominance.

**Example**:
- Round 1: Church controls R3 (1/3)
- Round 2: Church controls R3 (2/3)
- Round 3: Church controls R3 (3/3) → **VICTORY**

---

## SCENARIO OBJECTIVES (Optional Bonus Points)

These are OPTIONAL goals for competitive play. Track separately from Reliquary points.

### Church Objectives
- [ ] **Holy Crusade**: Control 3+ Reliquaries simultaneously (3 bonus points)
- [ ] **Martyr's Advance**: Use Blood Offering while standing on R3 (Central Cathedral) (2 bonus points)
- [ ] **Sacred Purge**: Destroy opponent's Right Arm component (5 bonus points)

### Dwarven Objectives
- [ ] **Fortress Eternal**: Control R3 (Central Cathedral) for 2 consecutive Rounds (3 bonus points)
- [ ] **Runic Supremacy**: Have 3 Rune Counters active while on R3 (2 bonus points)
- [ ] **Ironclad Defense**: Survive 10+ Rounds without reshuffling (5 bonus points)

---

## SPECIAL RULES FOR THIS SCENARIO

### 1. Objective Denial
You can **contest** a Reliquary by standing on it, denying opponent control:
- If Church is on R1 (1 hex) and Dwarves are on R1 (other hex), NEITHER player gets points
- If Church is on R3 (1 hex) and Dwarves are on R3 (another hex), NEITHER player gets 2-point bonus
- **Strategic implication**: Blocking opponent from scoring is as valuable as scoring yourself

### 2. Central Cathedral High Ground
R3 (Central Cathedral) is on Elevation 2:
- Costs 3 SP to climb from ground level (expensive)
- Grants +2 damage to all attacks FROM this position
- Ignore cover when attacking from R3
- Worth 2 points (highest value single objective)

### 3. Pillar Cover
Pillars (P) provide **total cover**:
- Cannot attack through Pillars
- Must move around to get LOS
- +2 Defense when standing on Pillar hex
- Creates chokepoints and tactical positioning

### 4. Forest LOS Blocking
Forest blocks LOS if **2+ forest hexes in a row**:
- Example: Attacker → [F] → [F] → Target = BLOCKED
- Example: Attacker → [F] → Target = NOT BLOCKED (only 1 forest)
- Use forest to hide from ranged attacks

### 5. Water Heat Management
Water hexes remove **2 Heat** (instead of standard 1):
- Encourages aggressive Heat buildup
- Risk/reward: spend 2 SP to enter Water, remove 2 Heat
- Dwarves (high Heat generation) benefit more

---

## EXPECTED GAME FLOW

### Rounds 1-2: Rush Objectives (20 minutes)
- Church rushes North Shrines (R1) + East/West Shrines (R2)
- Dwarves rush South Shrines (R4, R5)
- Both players avoid Central Cathedral (expensive to climb)
- First control points scored (3-4 points each)
- Minimal combat, mostly positioning

### Rounds 3-5: Cathedral Contest (20 minutes)
- Both players push toward Central Cathedral (R3, worth 2 points)
- First climb costs 3 SP (significant investment)
- Combat begins on Elevation 2 platform
- High-ground advantage (+2 dmg) matters
- Control points swing (5-6 points for leader)

### Rounds 6-8: Objective Denial (15 minutes)
- Losing player contests objectives instead of scoring
- Example: Church holds R1 + R2 + R3 (5 points), Dwarves move to R1 to deny 1 point
- Combat intensifies (must kill opponent to unblock objective)
- Heat builds, Strain checks occur
- First reshuffle likely (Damage cards appear)

### Rounds 9-12: Endgame (15 minutes)
- One player reaches 6+ points OR
- One player's deck death spirals (multiple Damage cards) OR
- Central Cathedral controlled 3 consecutive Rounds
- Desperate all-in attacks to break objective control

**Expected Winner**: 55/45 Church favor (higher mobility, faster objective grabbing)

---

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

This scenario teaches:
1. **Objective control tactics**: When to contest vs when to score
2. **Map control**: Controlling space > killing opponent
3. **Mobility vs durability**: Church's speed vs Dwarven tankiness
4. **High-ground advantage**: Elevation 2 (+2 dmg) is powerful
5. **Chokepoint usage**: Pillars create tactical bottlenecks
6. **Resource allocation**: Spend SP on movement or combat?
7. **Long-term planning**: 3-Round Cathedral victory requires sustained control

After playing this scenario 2-3 times, players should understand:
- How to balance offense (combat) with objectives (map control)
- When to turtle (hold objectives) vs when to attack (break control)
- How to use terrain for advantage (Pillars, Forest, Water)

---

## POST-GAME DEBRIEF

### Strategic Questions
1. Did you prioritize objectives or combat? Which was more effective?
2. Which Reliquaries were most valuable? (Central Cathedral vs outer shrines?)
3. Did you use Pillar cover effectively?
4. Did you contest opponent's objectives or focus on your own?
5. How many Rounds did the game last? (Target: 10-12 Rounds)

### Tactical Questions
1. Did Central Cathedral (R3, Elevation 2) feel worth the 3 SP climb cost?
2. Did high-ground advantage (+2 dmg from E2) impact combat significantly?
3. Did Forest LOS blocking create interesting positioning choices?
4. Did Water Heat removal (2 Heat) encourage Heat-heavy plays?

### Balance Observations
- Did Church's mobility (Desperate Lunge, Overextend) dominate objective grabbing?
- Did Dwarven durability (32 HP, Repair Servitors) matter in long games?
- Did 6-point victory threshold feel too easy/hard to achieve?
- Did 3-Round Cathedral dominance victory occur? (Or was it ignored?)

---

## VARIANT RULES (OPTIONAL)

### Variant 1: Timed Rounds (Tournament Play)
- Each Round has a 5-minute timer
- If time expires, both players pass turn immediately
- Control check happens at end of time
- Speeds up gameplay (60-minute hard cap)

### Variant 2: Reliquary Activation
- Standing on a Reliquary for **full turn** (Refresh → End) grants bonus:
  - R1 (North): Draw 1 card
  - R2 (East/West): Remove 2 Heat
  - R3 (Central): Gain 1 Rune Counter (any faction)
  - R4 (South): Recover 1 card from discard
  - R5 (Far South): +1 SP next turn
- Encourages holding objectives instead of contesting

### Variant 3: Sudden Death Overtime
- If game reaches Round 12 without 6-point victory:
  - Central Cathedral (R3) becomes worth 4 points instead of 2
  - First player to control R3 wins immediately
  - Forces climactic Cathedral battle

### Variant 4: Fog of War
- Deploy tokens face-down at start
- Don't reveal which Casket until first attack
- Allows bluffing and misdirection
- Advanced competitive play

---

## DESIGN NOTES

### Why This Scenario Exists
Scenario #1 (Proving Grounds) is a pure deathmatch. It teaches combat mechanics but doesn't test:
- Map control
- Objective prioritization
- Long-term strategy (10+ Rounds)

Scenario #2 (Reliquary Ruins) forces players to:
- Balance offense (combat) with objectives (map control)
- Make tough choices (attack or grab objective?)
- Plan 3+ Rounds ahead (Cathedral dominance victory)

### Church vs Dwarves Balance
**Church advantages in this scenario**:
- Higher mobility (Desperate Lunge, Overextend) = faster objective grabbing
- Buckler Shield provides defense without sacrificing speed
- Righteous Fury (+1 dmg per component destroyed) scales in long games

**Dwarven advantages in this scenario**:
- 32 HP + Repair Servitors = extreme durability (can outlast Church)
- Jury-Rig prevents Damage cards (death spiral resistance)
- Unbreakable Spirit (1 resurrection) = 2 lives essentially
- Armor-piercing (Crushing Blow) breaks Church's Buckler Shield

**Expected win rate**: 55/45 Church favor (mobility > durability for objectives)

### Central Cathedral (R3) Design
R3 is intentionally powerful but expensive:
- Worth 2 points (20% of total needed)
- Costs 3 SP to climb (60% of Church's SP, Dwarves entire SP pool)
- On Elevation 2 (+2 dmg advantage)
- +2 Defense (holy ground)

**Risk/reward**: Spend 60% SP to climb, but gain 2 points + high-ground advantage

**3-Round dominance victory**: Rewards sustained control over burst grabbing

---

**STATUS**: PLAYTEST READY
**NEXT STEP**: Print map, prepare decks, play scenario
**ESTIMATED TIME**: 60-75 minutes (longer than Scenario #1 due to objective control)
**DIFFICULTY**: Intermediate (requires tactical map awareness)
