## Technical Implementation

### Data Loading
```javascript
// Load from JSON
fetch('complete-card-data.json')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Flatten equipment structure
    // Assign factions
    // Populate tabs
  });
```

### Filtering System
```javascript
// Multi-criteria filtering
filtered = cards.filter(card => {
  // Tab filter
  // Search filter (name + effect + keywords)
  // Type filter
  // Cost filter
  // Slot filter (equipment only)
});
```

### LocalStorage Auto-Save
```javascript
// Deck builder auto-saves to:
key: 'penance-deck-builder-autosave'
value: { deckName, cards[] }
```

### Performance
- **Debounced search**: 300ms delay
- **Lazy loading**: 50 cards per batch
- **Virtual scrolling**: For large result sets
