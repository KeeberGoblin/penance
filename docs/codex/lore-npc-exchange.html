            <p class="npc-description">
                The spiritual leader of the Ledger Orthodox, Balthus claims to possess "Ledger Sight"—perfect memory of every transaction he's ever witnessed or recorded. Whether this is divine gift or photographic memory is debated, but his ability to recall obscure contract clauses from decades past is legendary (and terrifying). He views debt as spiritual bondage and contract-breaking as damnation.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Balthus walks a razor's edge between zealot and pragmatist. He genuinely believes in the Great Ledger's divine authority but uses that belief to justify ruthless debt collection. He personally leads Enforcer squads to hunt contract-breakers, viewing execution as "merciful release from spiritual debt." Wears simple robes but carries a gilded ledger containing names of the damned.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "The ledger balances. Always. You may run from your debts in this life, but the Great Reckoning awaits all who break faith."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Zealously religious, absolutely inflexible on contract law, views economics as divine order. Genuinely believes he's saving souls by enforcing debt. Despises Director Voss's moral relativism but recognizes their partnership's necessity. Sees himself as moral anchor preventing the Exchange from becoming purely predatory.

            <p class="npc-description">
                A pre-Sundering banker's daughter who inherited her father's empire at age 19 when he died in the Cataclysm. Voss is ice-cold pragmatism incarnate—emotionally detached, morally neutral, and utterly brilliant at market manipulation. She views faith as "useful fiction" that keeps borrowers honest but privately believes only in supply, demand, and leverage.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Voss runs the Exchange's day-to-day operations with surgical efficiency. She's responsible for Credit issuance, interest rates, and strategic investments. Rumored to have secret deals with every major faction—selling weapons to the Church while funding Elven resistance, profiting from both sides of every conflict. When confronted, she simply says: "Everything has a price. Including loyalty."
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "Brother Balthus believes in divine judgment. I believe in compound interest. We both get results."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Ruthlessly pragmatic, emotionally detached, master manipulator. Views people as assets or liabilities, nothing more. Has no ideology beyond profit and stability (which enables more profit). Disdains Balthus's moralizing but respects his ability to motivate Enforcers. Genuinely believes amoral capitalism is humanity's best survival mechanism.

            <p class="npc-description">
                The Exchange's most effective debt collector and the man other factions fear most. Jax is a former Nomad who signed an employment contract with the Exchange at age 19—trading his freedom for steady pay and excellent benefits. He's been collecting debts ever since, and he's very, very good at it. His personal motto: "I don't make the contracts. I just enforce them."
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Jax pilots <em>The Creditor</em>, a heavily armored Casket equipped with non-lethal suppression weapons (sonic stunners, net launchers, magnetic restraints). He prefers taking debtors alive—dead people can't work off debts. He's known for creative payment plans: "Can't pay in Credits? Pay in labor. Can't labor? Pay in organs. Can't afford organs? Well, there's always Soulstones..."
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to collect. How painful that is depends entirely on you."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Professional, eerily polite, genuinely believes he's doing honest work. Views debt collection as morally neutral—people signed contracts, he enforces them. Surprisingly empathetic about debtors' situations but absolutely inflexible about payment. Has never failed to collect, though he'll accept creative payment methods to maintain his perfect record.

            <p class="npc-description">
                The Exchange's youngest senior broker and a financial prodigy. Sienna earned her first 100,000 Credits by age 22 through aggressive commodity speculation—buying up grain futures before droughts, stockpiling weapons before wars, shorting currencies before collapses. Some call her brilliant; others call her a vulture. She calls herself "responsive to market signals."
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Sienna represents the new generation of Exchange leadership—amoral, data-driven, and completely detached from the human cost of profit. She trades Soulstones like stocks, buys debt contracts in bulk for pennies on the Credit, and resells them at massive markups. She's never met most of the people whose lives she destroys with margin calls and foreclosures. They're just numbers in her ledger.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "Empathy is expensive. I prefer efficiency."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Brilliant, sociopathic, utterly amoral. Views people as market variables—predictable inputs generating calculable outputs. Has zero emotional connection to consequences of her speculation. Genuinely cannot understand why people are angry when she profits from their suffering. Sees herself as simply optimizing resource allocation. Many believe she's Director Voss's successor.
