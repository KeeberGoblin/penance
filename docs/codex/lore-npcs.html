            These are the living legends of Year 437—pilots whose names are whispered in taverns and scrawled in combat logs. Each has paid a terrible price for their power. Each carries scars that tell stories of survival, mutation, and the cost of binding one's fate to a Casket.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Sister Vex's most striking feature is her complete lack of facial features—a smooth expanse of ritually burned scar tissue where eyes, nose, and mouth once were. Communion-stones pulse with dull red light beneath the scarred skin, forming a constellation pattern across her faceless head. Prayer-chains are welded directly to her exposed ribs, visible through torn High Penitent robes of faded crimson. Patches of crystalline Soulstone growth protrude from her shoulders and collarbone like grotesque tumors, glowing faintly with inner light. Her hands are wrapped in blood-stained cloth, and her posture suggests both exhaustion and unyielding determination. The overall impression is of a martyr who has transcended humanity through suffering.

            Once the Inquisition's most feared prosecutor, Vex attempted to save her Taint-corrupted daughter through a forbidden blood ritual. The child died, but the Taint took root in Vex's soul. Rather than face execution, she mutilated herself—removing her face so she could no longer weep. The Church declared her a saint. She seeks death in every battle, but death refuses to claim her.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Grayle is a towering figure, 6'7" with the build of an executioner. His head is shaved clean and tattooed with scripture in microscopic text, covering every inch of scalp and extending down his neck. His right eye is a milky white cataract, the result of staring into a Void rift during an exorcism; his left eye burns with fanatical intensity. He wears heavy crimson armor plates over black leather, each plate engraved with the names of heretics he's "absolved" (executed). His jaw is clenched perpetually, teeth filed to points in an act of self-mortification. Burn scars cover his hands from handling blessed fire without gloves. He carries himself with the rigid posture of absolute conviction—a man who has never doubted, never questioned, never shown mercy.

            Grayle has personally executed 412 "heretics" and "Taint-bearers" in his 20-year career. He believes suffering purifies the soul, and fire is the ultimate sacrament. His Casket, The Pyre, is equipped with promethium flamethrowers and blessed incendiary rounds. He underwent voluntary blinding in one eye to "see only truth" and files his teeth to remind himself he is a weapon, not a man. He hunts Void-corrupted with relentless zeal, viewing mercy as weakness and compromise as heresy.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Durr is more machine than dwarf—60% of his body replaced with clockwork prosthetics. His left arm is a multi-tool apparatus with rotating drill bits and precision instruments. His right leg is a piston-driven hydraulic limb that hisses with each step. One eye is a magnifying lens array that clicks and rotates mechanically when he focuses. A glass window in his sternum reveals a pressure gauge tracking his blood pressure in real-time. His beard is patchy and singed from forge accidents, and his remaining flesh is covered in self-inflicted measurement scars. He carries calipers and rulers at all times, obsessively measuring everything. His expression is emotionless, analytical—the face of a man who has replaced feeling with calculation.

Durr survived buried under rubble for three days, calculating the exact engineering failure. The realization broke him: the universe is a poorly designed machine running on faulty math. He rebuilt himself with prosthetics to "eliminate biological inefficiencies" and now treats everything—emotions, combat, morality—as engineering problems to be solved through calculation.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Karsa is a stocky dwarf woman with iron-gray hair braided with copper wire and rivets. Her skin has a metallic sheen—the result of decades of Soulstone exposure causing mineral deposits in her flesh. Her teeth are bronze replacements, filed sharp, and her tongue is stained black from "tasting" metal alloys (she can identify ore composition by licking it). Her hands are perpetually stained with rust and oil, nails cracked and blackened. She wears a heavy leather apron over runic armor, the apron pockets bulging with scrap metal, bolts, and improvised tools. Acid burn scars cover her forearms from experimental metalwork. Her eyes are the color of molten iron, and her expression is one of fierce, stubborn pride—a master craftsman who refuses to acknowledge limits.

            Karsa earned her title by surviving the Ashveil Collapse—a mine disaster where she was trapped for 11 days with no food. She survived by eating rust scraped from mine walls, her body adapting to metabolize metal. Now she's obsessed with perfecting "living metal"—Casket components that repair themselves. The Crucible is her workshop and weapon, equipped with mobile forge and welding arms. She views scrapping enemy Caskets as "recycling" and has filed her teeth to bite through steel cable (she once chewed through her own restraints during capture).

                Thresh is a skeletal lich wrapped in tattered nobleman's robes—moth-eaten velvet and silk from the Old World. His skull is pristine ivory, polished to a mirror sheen, with rubies socketed in his eye sockets that glow with cold, calculating light. Every bone in his skeleton is inscribed with microscopic contract text—thousands of names covering every surface. He has too many bones—extra ribs, redundant finger bones, spare vertebrae grafted from previous owners like grotesque trophies. His jaw moves with unsettling precision when he speaks, and the names etched on his bones whisper in chorus. He wears jeweled rings on skeletal fingers and carries himself with the posture of a corrupt aristocrat—polite, refined, and utterly remorseless.

            Before the Cataclysm, Thresh was a loan shark and contract lawyer. When the Sundering occurred, he made necromantic pacts with dying survivors, promising "eternal life" in exchange for "small favors after death." Hundreds signed. They didn't read the fine print. Thresh kept his promises—he granted eternal life. But the contracts stipulated souls remained his property, to be called upon for labor, combat, or experimentation. He's built an undead empire on predatory lending.

                Mortis is a haunting figure—gaunt, pale, with translucent skin that reveals the shadow of bones beneath. His eyes are completely black, no whites, like staring into empty sockets. His mouth is sewn shut with silver thread, rendering him completely mute; he communicates through a bone-inscribed sign language only the Ossuarium understands. His hair is white as bleached bone and hangs lank around a hollow-cheeked face. He wears a plague doctor's mask over his sewn mouth when in public, adding to his unsettling appearance. His hands are skeletal thin, with abnormally long fingers that move with spider-like precision. He's covered in preservation runes carved into his flesh—rituals to prevent his body from fully dying or fully living. His presence drains sound; rooms grow quieter when he enters, voices become whispers.

His body temperature is permanently 50°F. He's become the Ossuarium's most effective infiltrator, using his Silence Field to muffle sound within 30 feet—footsteps, weapon fire, even screams vanish into eerie quiet. He hunts with surgical precision, binding souls before victims realize they're dead. Some say his sewn mouth hides a scream that's been building for 15 years.

Her skin has a greenish tint, with bark-like growths covering shoulders and forearms. Her hands have split into twig-like appendages, allowing direct interface with living wood machinery. Most disturbing are her eyes: solid amber with no pupils or whites, and sap occasionally leaks from the corners like tears. Thorny vines grow from her scalp instead of hair, constantly writhing. Her expression is eerily calm, even serene, as if she's achieved some plant-like enlightenment beyond mortal concerns. Lichen patches grow on her exposed skin, and small flowers bloom from cracks in her bark-flesh.

She now "prunes" in a different way—hunting corruption sources and cutting them away with surgical precision. She believes the entire world is a garden, and she is the gardener. Everything that doesn't belong must be removed.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Sylris is beautiful in a disturbing way—too perfect, like a porcelain doll. Her skin is pale as birch bark, and her hair is living crimson vines that flow like blood-red water. Her eyes are deep forest green with vertical slit pupils like a predator. Most striking are the thorns growing from her body—emerging from joints, shoulders, and along her spine like a natural weapon. When she bleeds (which is often, from self-inflicted ritual cuts), flowers bloom from the blood. She wears living armor—bark plates that have grown onto her skin, impossible to remove without flaying her alive. Crimson sap weeps from cracks in the bark. She moves with unnatural grace, every gesture deliberate and ritualistic, as if she's performing a sacred dance even in combat.

            Sylris performed the Crimson Rite—a forbidden ritual where elves merge with carnivorous plants to gain predatory power. She bonded with a Void-touched Blood Vine, and now she feeds on violence. Her Casket, The Bleeding Garden, sprouts thorny vines that impale enemies and drain their fluids. She views combat as sacred—an offering to the "Old Growth," a deity she claims whispered to her during the ritual. Other elves fear her as a heretic, but she's undeniably effective. She cuts herself before battle as a prayer, letting flowers bloom from her wounds.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Mockingbird doesn't have a face—or rather, she has too many. She wears constantly shifting porcelain masks, each representing a stolen identity, phasing in and out like reflections in broken mirrors. Beneath the masks is nothing but void filled with distant stars and impossible geometries. Her body is similarly unstable: sometimes two arms, sometimes six, sometimes none. Her height varies by several feet moment to moment. Her voice is a chorus of stolen identities speaking in overlapping echoes. She wears layered robes of shimmering fabric that looks like captured moonlight, and her presence distorts space slightly—doorways become oval, shadows point the wrong direction. Staring at her for too long causes vertigo and migraines.

            Mockingbird is ancient—old enough she's forgotten her true name. She collects possibilities—alternate versions of events that never happened. When the Sundering opened rifts, she walked through, fascinated by this broken world. She doesn't fight for territory or resources, but for stories—collecting "what-ifs" of every battle. What if the hero turned coward? What if the dead lived? She steals alternate outcomes and wears them like masks, becoming a walking archive of roads not taken.

                The Veil-Walker appears as a slender androgynous figure draped in translucent silk that seems to exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Their skin is opalescent, shifting between pale white, deep violet, and chromatic reflections depending on the angle of light. They have no face—instead, a smooth mirror surface reflects the viewer's greatest regret. Their hands end in impossibly long fingers (seven per hand, not five) that trail wisps of silver mist. They wear a crown of moth wings and shattered glass that hovers above their head without touching. Their movements are wrong—they walk forward but cast shadows that move backward. Reality distorts around them: colors invert, time stutters, gravity weakens. Those who meet their gaze see glimpses of their alternate selves in parallel worlds.

            The Veil-Walker claims to be "a sorrow that learned to move." They are Fae who became obsessed with human grief and began collecting it, wearing regrets like jewelry. They can phase between dimensions, existing in multiple realities simultaneously. Their Casket, The Folded Path, operates on non-Euclidean principles—it can be in two places at once or nowhere at all. They offer impossible bargains: "Give me your saddest memory, and I'll make you forget what made you sad." Those who accept find themselves hollow, emotions muted, unable to feel joy or pain.

Most memorable are the three playing cards permanently embedded in his left eye socket—Ace of Spades, Nine of Hearts, and Joker—fused there by a Soulstone explosion. His right arm is entirely prosthetic scavenged junk held together with wire, covered in welded-on trinkets: rabbit feet, dice, compass needles. He wears a tattered duster coat with patched holes, each patch from a different convoy he's guided. His remaining eye is gray and tired, and his face carries the look of a man who's gambled with death and keeps winning despite wanting to lose. Dust and ash are permanently ground into his skin and clothes.

Tribal tattoos cover every inch of exposed skin in geometric patterns representing "the paths reality can take." Her hands are gnarled and scarred from handling probability charms made of scavenged tech, bone, and Void-touched crystals. She carries a staff hung with dozens of small mirrors and glass shards that tinkle eerily in the wind. Her posture is that of a crone, hunched and ancient despite being only 40 years old—the Wasteland ages people fast. Dust perpetually swirls around her as if drawn to her presence.

His eyes are sharp, darting, constantly assessing value. He has a merchant's smile—too wide, too practiced, never reaching his eyes. Acid scars mar his forearms from soul-acid burns during a vault robbery he barely survived. He carries multiple ledgers chained to his belt.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Tallis is a patchwork of grafted animal parts—wolf forelimb for left arm, eagle's golden eye in right socket, deer legs allowing digitigrade locomotion. His torso is sewn shut with thick black thread as if his entire body is a quilt of stolen flesh. When he moves, stitches creak and sometimes tear, leaking black ichor. His face is mostly human but his mouth is split at the corners like a Glasgow smile, revealing too many teeth. He wears a blood-stained leather apron covered in surgical tools and vials. His remaining human skin is covered in fur, scales, chitin, and feathers—all stitched together with surgical precision. He moves with uncanny grace, animal instincts merged with human intelligence.

            Tallis was a Church field medic when a Void rift exposed his garrison to mutation energy. As his body transformed, he realized he could control the process—directing where mutations took hold. He became the first Woundwright—a surgeon who grafts Blighted mutations onto others. His philosophy: "The body is just meat. Meat can be rewritten." He's created abominations and saved lives by grafting resistant tissue onto radiation victims. His Casket, The Abattoir, is a living workshop that grafts mutations onto itself, adapting to threats.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Vor is barely humanoid—a hulking mass of predatory mutations standing 7'4" tall. His head is wolf-like with too many eyes (six total) scattered asymmetrically across his skull. His jaw unhinges like a snake's, and his teeth are replaced with jagged obsidian shards he's jammed into his gums. His arms are asymmetrical: left is a mantis-claw scythe, right is a bear's limb with retractable talons. His torso is covered in chitinous plates growing from beneath the skin, pushing outward in grotesque ridges. His spine has extra vertebrae, giving him serpentine flexibility. Most horrifying is his regeneration—wounds visibly heal in real-time, flesh knitting together with wet, organic sounds. He's covered in ritual scars from "feeding ceremonies" where he consumed enemy pilots mid-battle.

            Vor is an Apex-Strain Vestige—a mutation so advanced he's become a new apex predator. He embraces the Bloodlines' philosophy of "evolution through consumption," literally eating defeated enemies to absorb their genetic traits. His Casket, The Maw, has a functioning digestive system and can consume scrap metal to repair itself. Vor speaks in guttural, broken sentences, his intelligence degrading as his predatory instincts dominate. He's worshipped by some Vestiges as "the future of humanity" and hunted by others as a cautionary tale. He grows stronger with every kill.

                Zephyr is mid-metamorphosis—half-human, half-insectoid. Their skin is chitinous teal and green, segmented like armor plates. Four arms sprout from their torso: two human-like (but with chitinous plating), two mantis-style scythes. Their face is transitioning—jaw extending into mandibles, eyes fracturing into compound arrays with thousands of facets that shimmer iridescent. Antennae protrude from their forehead, constantly twitching, sensing pheromones. Their back has partially formed wings—translucent membrane stretched over chitin framework—not functional yet but growing. They wear bio-organic symbiote clothing that's fused to their exoskeleton. Their movements are precise, efficient, insectoid—no wasted motion. Hive pheromones visibly waft from their body as colorful mist.

            Zephyr is a Hive-Node—an Emergent who's achieved advanced metamorphosis and serves as a psychic relay for the Collective Consciousness. They're currently in their third instar stage, transitioning toward their final form. Zephyr remembers being human but considers it a "larval stage" they've outgrown. Their Casket, The Metamorph, is bio-organic and grows with them, capable of reconfiguring for flight, burrowing, or combat. Zephyr speaks with unsettling calm, referring to themselves in plural ("We believe," "Our transformation"). They're evangelical about the "Chosen Evolution," trying to convert others.

                <strong>Portrait Description:</strong><br>
                Krix is terrifyingly alien—their body is a hive in miniature. Translucent chitin reveals thousands of symbiotic insects living inside their body cavity, visible as writhing masses beneath the skin. Their torso has breathing spiracles that pulse rhythmically, releasing pheromone clouds. Instead of a single voice, Krix emits harmonic insect songs—clicks, buzzes, and chirps that form words through pattern recognition. Their head has been replaced entirely by a biomechanical hive structure—honeycomb chambers where their brain used to be, processing information through distributed neural network. Smaller insects constantly crawl over their body, acting as sensory extensions. Their hands are adapted for tool use but have insectoid joints bending in impossible directions. They smell of honey, earth, and decay.

Their Casket, The Symbiosis, is hollow and filled with egg sacs—a mobile hive capable of spawning reinforcements mid-battle. Krix is utterly alien in thought, speaking in collective consensus. They view individuality as "inefficient genetic noise" and evangelize for complete integration.

His teeth are filed to sharp points, and his tongue is literally blackened from tasting ash and licking hot metal (he believes it brings "fire-luck"). His hands are wrapped in scorched bandages hiding severe burn injuries he refuses to heal. He wears scraps of heat-resistant gear cobbled together from a dozen sources, including a cracked welder's mask pushed up on his head like a crown. Crude explosive devices are strapped across his chest and belt—bombs held together with wire, faith, and prayers to the First Forge. He moves with twitchy, manic energy, constantly checking fuses and cackling to himself.

                Grikka is an ancient goblin (ancient for goblins means 50+ years—most die by 30). She's hunched, wiry, with skin like cracked volcanic stone. Her eyes have been ritually burned out—empty sockets filled with smoldering embers that glow orange in darkness. She "sees" through heat vision and vibrations, navigating by sensing warmth signatures. Her body is covered in ash tattoos depicting flame patterns and explosion diagrams—sacred geometry of the First Forge. She wears robes made from fireproof tarps scavenged from pre-Sundering firefighting gear, decorated with bone charms and obsidian shards. Her staff is topped with a still-glowing piece of volcanic glass. She speaks in crackling whispers, as if her throat has been scorched by inhaling too much smoke and ash.

Her Casket, The Ash-Prophet, is a mobile shrine covered in totems of ash and bone. She performs pre-battle rites, blessing crude bombs with prayers and sprinkling them with volcanic ash.
