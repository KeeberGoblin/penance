                <p><strong>Casket:</strong> Heavy - "The Confessional" (1,600 lbs)</p>
                <p><strong>Taint:</strong> 7 (Advanced Corruption)</p>
                <div class="trait">Martyrdom Protocol - Cannot die, sacrifices permanent injuries to survive</div>
                <p>Once the Inquisition's most feared prosecutor, Vex attempted to save her Taint-corrupted daughter through a forbidden blood ritual. The child died. The Taint took root in Vex's soul instead. Now she collects the dying, the corrupt, the broken. Her crew of permanently indebted souls pilot her support systems, forever bound to a woman who cannot feel pain because she cannot feel anything.</p>

                <div class="trait">Probability Matrix - Knows exact card counts, manipulates deck order</div>
                <p>Lead engineer on the catastrophic Echo Project, a failed attempt to replicate the Theslar Engine. A rounding error in the 47th decimal place killed 200 dwarves. Durr survived buried under rubble for 3 days, performing complex calculations on the cave walls in his own blood until rescuers found him. He has never apologized. He has never regretted. To him, it was data. Acceptable losses for optimal outcome.</p>

                <p>Before the Cataclysm, Thresh was a loan shark and contract lawyer. When the Sundering occurred, he made necromantic pacts with dying survivors, promising "eternal life" in exchange for their souls as collateral. He collected. They died. And their debts, mysteriously, never expired. Now his empire consists of thousands of enslaved souls, each bound by ironclad contracts written in their own blood. He is the richest being alive. He has nothing to spend it on. He continues accumulating anyway.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold);">"All debts come due. Your death is merely a change of employer."</p>

        <h2>Using Iconic Pilots in Play</h2>

        <h3>As Antagonists</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Each pilot can serve as a Raid Boss with their own AI behavior deck, or as recurring campaign villains with shifting motivations. Their unique abilities make them memorable opponents.
        </p>

        <h3>As Allies</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Players might temporarily ally with these pilots during crisis events (Abomination raids, faction wars), creating uncomfortable partnerships with deeply flawed individuals.
        </p>

        <h3>As Faction Representatives</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Use these pilots during Faction Negotiation scenes. They embody their faction's philosophy in twisted, extreme ways, showing what happens when ideology is taken to its logical end.
        </p>

        <h3>As Cautionary Tales</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            These pilots demonstrate what happens when you lean too hard into Casket piloting: martyrdom becomes addiction, optimization erases humanity, exploitation hollows you out, nature consumes identity, reality dissolves, prophecy drives madness, empathy dies, evolution becomes horror, individuality vanishes, and destruction becomes worship.
        </p>
