            <p class="npc-description">
                The last "stable" Alpha of the Fenmar bloodline—Vestiges with lupine mutations (wolf ears, enhanced senses, pack mentality). Kael leads ~400 Fenmar through sheer force of will, coordinating hunts and territory defense. She's terrifyingly aware that she's deteriorating—each generation degrades faster than the last. Her grandmother could disconnect for 3 days; her mother managed 18 hours. Kael gets 6 hours. Her children (if she has any) might get minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Kael shares neural load with her pack via direct Casket linking—allowing collective consciousness to extend coherence. When one Fenmar starts going feral, others absorb the mental strain. It's communal suffering as survival mechanism. She's proposed merging ALL Vestiges into single hive-mind to extend coherence indefinitely, but most bloodlines refuse. She's considering forcing the issue.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"We hunt together. We die together. And when the time comes, we'll become something else entirely... together."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Fiercely protective, increasingly desperate. Leads through loyalty and fear. Believes forced collective consciousness might be Vestiges' only survival path. Willing to sacrifice autonomy for species preservation.</p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                The oldest surviving Vestige, a living relic of the 3rd generation. Grendok possesses ursine strength—bear claws, thick fur, massive build, incredible endurance. Unlike other bloodlines racing toward extinction, Grendok has accepted it. He believes "peaceful fadeout is mercy"—that Vestiges should withdraw from the world, hibernate like bears, and die quietly in their sleep rather than desperately clinging to degraded existence.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Once disconnected for 30 hours (record for any Vestige) and suffered permanent bone density damage. He moves slowly now, deliberately, like walking is painful. "The Casket is an alarm clock that never stops ringing. I just want to sleep. Forever." His Urtok clan hoards resources in mountain caves, preparing for final hibernation—a mass sleep from which they don't intend to wake.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"There's dignity in accepting death. None in thrashing against the inevitable. Let us sleep. Let us rest. We've suffered enough."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Resigned, philosophical, exhausted. Embodies peaceful extinction philosophy. Opposes Kael's desperate survival schemes. Believes suffering should end, not be prolonged. Planning mass "Long Sleep" ceremony for entire Urtok bloodline.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="npc-description">
                The youngest bloodline leader and the most tragic. Sella has insectoid mutations—chitinous plating, compound eyes, pheromone communication. She can only disconnect from her Casket for 90 minutes before coherence collapses. She sleeps INSIDE her Casket with backup power cells running constantly. If power fails while she sleeps, she wakes as mindless animal.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Sella hears "the voice in the chitin"—whispers from the Emergent Syndicate's hive-mind, calling her to join them. The Syndicate promises full integration: merge with collective consciousness, abandon individual identity, gain infinite coherence. No more ticking clock. No more fear of going feral. Just... dissolution into something larger. She's terrified. And tempted.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"Every minute outside my Casket, I feel myself slipping. The hive calls. It promises peace. I don't know how much longer I can resist."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Desperate, fragile, on the edge of breakdown. Most sympathetic to Emergent integration. Many believe she'll defect to Syndicate within the year, taking entire Vexis bloodline with her. Represents tragic endpoint of Vestige degradation.</p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                The Serrak bloodline (serpentine mutations—scales, cold blood, venom glands) is shrouded in mystery. They live in isolated swamps and NEVER communicate with other bloodlines. Their leader, called "The Silent Coil," has never been seen—only referenced in terrified whispers. Some believe they're a 1st generation Vestige who survived 400+ years through unknown means.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Rumors claim the Silent Coil has achieved something impossible: reversing degradation. That they can disconnect indefinitely. That they've discovered how to restore Vestige stability. Others say they've simply gone completely feral and the Serrak worship them as a god. Truth is unknown. The Serrak kill anyone who enters their territory, leaving bodies wrapped in coils with eyes gouged out as warnings.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">[No recorded quotes. The Silent Coil has never spoken to outsiders.]</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Unknown. Possibly insane. Possibly genius. Possibly both. Represents ultimate mystery of Vestige future—evolution or devolution? Salvation or damnation? None dare investigate. Those who try don't return.</p>
