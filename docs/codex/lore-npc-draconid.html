            <p class="npc-description">
                The oldest living Draconid and witness to THREE complete apocalyptic cycles. Zhar'Thul appears as 8-foot-tall humanoid with skin like cracked marble, massive gemstone horns glowing with memories, and diamond tears constantly leaking from empty eye sockets. When he moves, crystalline grinding echoes like tomb doors opening. His voice resonates as if speaking from inside a cave—harmonic and ancient beyond comprehension.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Zhar'Thul is so calcified he's more Soulstone than flesh—barely able to move without assistance, body slowly transforming into living crystal. He maintains the Memory Archive: crystalline data-structures containing records of previous civilizations that rose, prospered, grew arrogant, and destroyed themselves. The current human Sundering is, to him, simply "Cycle 3, Iteration 7." He's seen it all before. He'll see it again.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"You believe your suffering is unique? Your apocalypse special? I have watched this pattern repeat twelve thousand years. Your ending is not even original."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Utterly exhausted, emotionally dead, resigned to eternal recurrence. Views current events with detached academic interest. Cannot die (too calcified), cannot intervene (too tired), can only observe and record. Represents tragic wisdom: knowing the future but being too weary to prevent it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="npc-card">
            <div class="npc-header">

            </div>
            <p class="npc-description">
                The Remembrance's chief librarian, responsible for maintaining Memory Shards—crystals containing experiences, knowledge, and histories of extinct civilizations. Vel'Myra spends centuries in deep meditation, interfacing with shards, absorbing millennia of data, and cataloguing patterns of civilizational collapse. She's witnessed (through memory) over 200 extinct species, 47 failed civilizations, and 12 apocalyptic events.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Unlike Zhar'Thul's exhaustion, Vel'Myra maintains scholarly fascination. She views apocalypses as data points in larger pattern-recognition study. "Why do civilizations always destroy themselves JUST when achieving technological breakthrough? What universal flaw makes success suicidal?" She believes answer exists in the Archive... but she's been searching for 8,000 years without success.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"Every civilization believes they are special. That their ending will be different. The Memory Shards contain 47 iterations of this exact conversation. You are pattern. You are data. You are predictable."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Scholarly, detached, views species as research subjects. Genuinely curious about apocalypse patterns but emotionally uninvested in preventing them. Believes intervention would corrupt data. Wants to UNDERSTAND extinction, not prevent it. Some call her monstrous; she calls herself scientific.</p>
        </div>

            </div>
            <p class="npc-description">
                The most ancient Draconid—so calcified that he cannot move at all. Kyr'Sath sits on a throne carved from single massive gemstone, body completely fused with the chair, crystalline tears flowing endlessly down his face. His horns are ENORMOUS—glowing with every memory witnessed across 15,000+ years. Looking directly at his horns causes visions of apocalypses: cities burning, oceans boiling, stars dying, reality collapsing.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Kyr'Sath speaks in prophecies and pattern analysis. He claims to have witnessed FIVE apocalyptic cycles (not three like Zhar'Thul)—two cycles lost to time that even other Draconids don't remember. He predicts this Sundering will resolve in one of three ways: total extinction, Void takeover, or emergence of new hybrid species. When asked which, he simply weeps crystal tears. "The answer is written in stone. Literally. I am becoming the answer."
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"I have seen stars born. I have seen stars die. I have seen civilizations rise from mud and return to dust. And I... I remain. Watching. Remembering. Regretting that I cannot forget."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Incomprehensible, speaks in circular riddles, possibly insane from 15,000 years of consciousness. Views linear time as illusion—speaks of past and future simultaneously. Some believe he's transcended normal awareness; others think he's simply broken. Either way, his prophecies are eerily accurate... and utterly useless for prevention.</p>
