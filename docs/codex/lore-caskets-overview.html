        <h1>Casket Technology: Bound Pilots in Mechanical Coffins</h1>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We are not machines. We are prisoners—living pilots, bound in neural fluid, puppeteering dead metal from inside our own tombs."

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Caskets are humanity's most powerful—and most horrifying—technology. These Soulstone-powered war machines are the only military equipment capable of fighting Abominations, controlling territory, and projecting power in the post-Sundering world. But they are not autonomous. Inside each Casket is a <strong>living human pilot</strong>, suspended in neural fluid, arms crossed like a mummy, controlling the machine through ten neural threads pierced through their fingertips.

        <h2>The Three Pillars of Casket Technology</h2>

        <h3>1. Pre-Sundering Origins</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Caskets began as <strong>industrial exoskeletons</strong>—heavy-duty powered armor for construction, mining, and disaster response. Companies like Titan Industries and Prometheus Corp built them for civilian use, never military applications. They survived the Theslar EMP because their fusion cells were radiation-shielded (industrial safety requirement) and their hydraulics were mechanical, not electronic.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>The Irony:</strong> The most primitive modern technology became the most advanced post-Sundering technology. Construction equipment became war machines.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Soul-Binding Discovery</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            On Year 0, Day 6, Dr. Marcus Thresher (later Bonelord Thresh) made the breakthrough: human souls could be bound to Soulstone cores at the moment of death, creating a perpetual power source. The pilot's consciousness remains—trapped in the ritual of binding, suspended between life and death. <a href="lore-soul-binding.html" target="_parent">Read the full soul-binding process here.</a>
        </p>

        <h3>3. The Neural Thread Control System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Living pilots (volunteers who undergo soul-binding at death) are suspended in neural fluid inside a containment chamber within the Casket's chassis. Ten <strong>neural threads</strong>—bio-mechanical interfaces—pierce through their fingertips (arms crossed like a mummy). The pilot manipulates the Casket like a puppeteer controlling a marionette, from inside. The deck of cards represents the pilot's vitality and the Casket's structural integrity—run out of cards, and the Casket is destroyed.

        <h3>The Pilot Experience</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            What does it feel like to be a living pilot bound inside a Casket? According to rare interviews with survivors:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Vision:</strong> See through optical sensors (monochrome, thermal, or night vision). Pilot's eyes are useless in the dark capsule</li>
            <li><strong>Hearing:</strong> Hear through audio pickups. Pilot's own voice echoes in the fluid—communication via radio only</li>
            <li><strong>Touch:</strong> Neural threads transmit feedback directly to fingertips. Feel every impact, every step, every wound as phantom pain</li>
            <li><strong>Taste/Smell:</strong> None. Neural fluid fills your lungs (you don't breathe, Soulstone sustains you). Sensory deprivation is maddening</li>
            <li><strong>Emotion:</strong> Ranges from acceptance to rage to despair. Some pilots go mad. Others find peace. Most endure</li>
            <li><strong>Time Perception:</strong> Distorted. Missions feel like hours. Downtime feels like years of darkness</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> Like puppeteering. Fingers twitch, Casket moves. Ten threads, ten strings. Pull the right one, survive another day</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "The horror isn't the violence. It's the waiting. Between battles, you float in darkness. No sleep. No dreams. No escape. Just your own thoughts, drowning in neural fluid, until someone needs you to kill again."

        <h2>The Moral Debate</h2>

        <h3>Arguments For Soul-Binding</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Survival Necessity:</strong> Without Caskets, humanity cannot fight Abominations or defend territory</li>
            <li><strong>Voluntary Contracts:</strong> Many souls agree to binding in exchange for compensation to their families</li>
            <li><strong>Honored Service:</strong> Pilots are celebrated as heroes, their sacrifice recognized</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative to True Death:</strong> Souls continue existing rather than facing oblivion</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arguments Against Soul-Binding</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Slavery:</strong> Souls are trapped, unable to rest or move on to afterlife</li>
            <li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> The desperate sign contracts they don't understand</li>
            <li><strong>Degradation:</strong> Souls lose memories, personality, humanity over time</li>
            <li><strong>Violation of Death:</strong> Weaponizing the afterlife is fundamentally wrong</li>
