        <h1>Daily Life in Year 437 After Sundering</h1>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We wake to ash-gray skies. We eat rationed bread baked from salvaged grain. We work in the shadow of Caskets that may or may not return. We pray to gods who may not listen. And we do it all again tomorrow, because that's what survival means."
            <span class="quote-attribution">— Nomad saying</span>
        </div>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Life in the Year 437 is defined by scarcity, uncertainty, and adaptation. The world that ended at the Sundering is not coming back—those who survive are those who accept this truth and find new ways to live within the constraints of a broken reality. This is a world where a single meal requires hours of preparation, where children are taught to fight before they learn to read, and where the line between civilization and barbarism is measured in how many Caskets a settlement can field.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Yet within this harshness, humanity persists. Communities form. Cultures develop. Art, music, and love find ways to flourish even in ash-choked air. This page explores how ordinary people—not Casket pilots or faction leaders, but farmers, merchants, children, and elders—navigate daily existence in a world where every tomorrow is uncertain.
        </p>

        <h2>Food & Agriculture</h2>

        <h3>The Challenge of Cultivation</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Post-Sundering agriculture is a desperate science. Global temperatures dropped 5-10°C after the Sundering, shortening growing seasons and reducing arable land by approximately 40%. Volcanic ash still periodically blankets regions, poisoning soil and blocking sunlight. Void rifts emit unpredictable bursts of energy that can cause crops to wither overnight or mutate into inedible forms.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Common crops</strong> include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ashgrain:</strong> A hardy, fast-growing wheat variant adapted to volcanic soil. Produces small, dense kernels with a bitter, chalky taste. Forms the dietary staple for 70% of the population.</li>
            <li><strong>Rootworms:</strong> Protein-rich insect larvae cultivated in underground farms. Unpleasant texture but efficient—one square meter of worm beds produces as much protein as ten square meters of livestock pasture.</li>
            <li><strong>Fungal Mats:</strong> Genetically engineered mushrooms that grow in near-total darkness on organic waste. Church settlements excel at fungal cultivation.</li>
            <li><strong>Salvage Vegetables:</strong> Pre-Sundering seeds preserved in vaults, carefully rationed and replanted each season. Carrots, potatoes, and onions exist but are rare luxuries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Meat & Protein</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Large livestock are rare and expensive. Most meat comes from:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rats & Vermin:</strong> Ubiquitous, fast-breeding, and tolerant of poor conditions. Rat stew is common fare in lower-class districts.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutated Game:</strong> Deer, boar, and other animals exposed to Void energy develop unpredictable mutations. Edible if properly butchered (removing Void-corrupted organs), but risky.</li>
            <li><strong>Preserved Pre-Sundering Meat:</strong> Freeze-dried, salted, or canned meat from before Year 0. Extremely valuable, often reserved for Casket pilots or military rations.</li>
            <li><strong>Synthetic Protein Paste:</strong> Produced in Dwarven chemical vats or Exchange bio-factories. Nutritionally complete but flavorless. Nicknamed "gray slop."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Water</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Clean water is the most valuable resource after Soulstones. Aquifers contaminated by Void energy produce "taint water"—liquid that appears normal but causes slow madness and organ failure over months. Every settlement invests heavily in water purification:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Kills bacteria but doesn't remove Void taint</li>
            <li><strong>Charcoal Filtration:</strong> Removes some impurities but inconsistent</li>
            <li><strong>Soulstone Purification:</strong> Passing water through Soulstone-infused filters neutralizes Void taint but is expensive and slow</li>
            <li><strong>Rationing:</strong> Average person receives 3-5 liters per day (drinking, cooking, minimal washing)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Clothing & Fashion</h2>

        <h3>Materials</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Pre-Sundering synthetic fabrics are treasures—durable, weather-resistant, and impossible to replicate without industrial infrastructure. Most clothing in Year 437 is made from:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Salvage Cloth:</strong> Fabric scavenged from pre-Sundering buildings, repaired and patched until it falls apart</li>
            <li><strong>Leather & Hide:</strong> From mutated animals, often oddly colored (green, purple, translucent) but functional</li>
            <li><strong>Ashweave:</strong> Coarse fabric woven from processed volcanic fibers mixed with salvaged cotton. Rough texture, irritates skin, but better than nothing</li>
            <li><strong>Fungal Leather:</strong> Dried and treated fungal mats, used by poorer populations. Stiff, cracks easily, smells faintly of decay</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fashion by Faction</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Church of Absolution:</strong> Favors red, black, and gray. Penitent robes with exposed shoulders or backs (to display scars from self-flagellation). Clergy wear ornate blood-red vestments with bone ornaments. Lower classes wear simple tunics with Church symbols embroidered at the breast.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Dwarven Forge-Guilds:</strong> Practicality above all—heavy leather aprons, reinforced gloves, steel-toed boots. Wealthier Dwarves display their craft through intricate metalwork: jewelry, belt buckles, decorative armor plates. Color palette: browns, grays, with bronze/copper accents.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Elven Verdant Covenant:</strong> Living clothing—vines, moss, and fungal growths cultivated directly on fabric or skin. Changes with seasons and wearer's mood. Vibrant greens, organic patterns, and exposed skin to maximize photosynthesis. Elves who live in cities often cover their "wild" clothing with practical cloaks to avoid attention.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>The Exchange:</strong> Wealth display is paramount. Exchange merchants wear pre-Sundering business attire (suits, ties, formal dresses) meticulously preserved and repaired. Gold jewelry, watches, and credit chips worn prominently. Lower-class Exchange citizens dress practically but always include one "wealth marker"—a single expensive accessory to signal ambition.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Nomad Collective:</strong> Layers upon layers—clothing designed to be added or removed rapidly as weather changes. Patchwork is aesthetic; no two Nomads dress alike. Bright colors preferred (easier to spot in dust storms). Practical: lots of pockets, tool loops, and gear straps.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>The Ossuarium:</strong> Black, gray, and bone-white. Undead-affiliated humans wear death masks or skull paint. Clothing often incorporates bones (human or animal) as decoration. Practical attire includes respirators and gloves (to handle corpses and Soulstones safely).
        </p>

        <h3>Protective Gear</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            In Void-active regions, specialized protective equipment is mandatory:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Respirators:</strong> Filter ash, toxins, and Void particulates. Mandatory in settlements near active rifts.</li>
            <li><strong>Void-Weave Cloaks:</strong> Fabric treated with Soulstone dust to provide limited protection against reality distortions.</li>
            <li><strong>Taint Goggles:</strong> Lenses that allow wearers to see Void energy fluctuations, helping them avoid dangerous areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Family & Social Structure</h2>

        <h3>Marriage & Partnership</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Marriage customs vary by faction but share common themes: <strong>survival-focused partnerships</strong>. Romantic love is a luxury; most marriages are pragmatic arrangements designed to pool resources, skills, and genetic diversity.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Typical courtship:</strong> A "trial period" of 6-12 months where potential partners work together—tending crops, repairing buildings, or raising borrowed children—to assess compatibility. If both parties remain interested, a formal bonding ceremony follows.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Polygamy/Polyandry:</strong> Common in Nomad and Ossuarium societies where population pressures demand maximum reproductive efficiency. Church officially condemns it but tolerates it in practice.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Same-sex partnerships:</strong> Widely accepted in most factions (Void corruption has made population genetics less predictable; genetic diversity can be managed through communal child-rearing). Exception: Church officially disapproves but enforcement is inconsistent.
        </p>

        <h3>Childbirth & Infant Mortality</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Birth rates:</strong> Approximately 2-4 children per woman (down from pre-Sundering averages of 5-7). Malnutrition, stress, and Void exposure have reduced fertility across all populations.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Infant mortality:</strong> Approximately 30-40% before age 5 (compared to <5% pre-Sundering). Primary causes: malnutrition, disease, Void taint exposure, accidents.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mutations:</strong> ~15% of births result in visible mutations (extra limbs, scales, Void-touched features). Most mutant children are accepted and integrated into communities, though severe mutations may result in abandonment or "mercy killings" in harsher factions.
        </p>

        <h3>Child-Rearing</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Children are raised communally in most settlements. Biological parents maintain primary responsibility, but neighbors, extended family, and community elders actively participate in child-rearing. This is practical (parents often work long hours) and cultural (communal investment in the next generation increases survival odds).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Education begins early:</strong> By age 5, children are expected to contribute to household labor—fetching water, tending small animals, sorting salvage. By age 10, they're assigned apprenticeships or begin formal training in trades.
        </p>

        <h3>Elders</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Reaching old age (60+) in Year 437 is rare and respected. Elders who can no longer perform physical labor transition to advisory roles—teaching, storytelling, conflict mediation, and record-keeping. In settlements with scarce resources, elderly individuals sometimes choose voluntary euthanasia ("the Long Walk") to free up resources for younger generations. This practice is controversial but pragmatically accepted in frontier settlements.
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Education & Literacy</h2>

        <h3>Formal Education</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Literacy rate:</strong> Approximately 40-50% across all factions (down from ~95% pre-Sundering). Education is a luxury most settlements cannot afford.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Who gets educated:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faction Elite:</strong> Children of Casket pilots, merchants, and officials receive formal schooling (reading, writing, mathematics, history)</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Apprentices:</strong> Those training for specialized roles (engineers, medics, archivists) receive role-specific education</li>
            <li><strong>Clergy/Scholars:</strong> Church acolytes, Ossuarium necromancers, and Dwarven runecrafters undergo intensive academic training</li>
            <li><strong>Everyone Else:</strong> Learns through apprenticeship, oral tradition, and practical experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Is Taught</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Survival Skills (universal):</strong> Identifying safe water, basic first aid, recognizing Void corruption, fire starting, navigation
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Combat Training (nearly universal):</strong> By age 12, most children can use basic weapons. Even non-combatants learn self-defense.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Trade Skills:</strong> Carpentry, farming, metalworking, textile production—taught through multi-year apprenticeships
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>History (rare):</strong> Only faction elites learn detailed history. Most know simplified narratives: "The Sundering happened, the old world ended, we survive now."
        </p>

        <h3>Oral Tradition</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            In the absence of widespread literacy, oral tradition is paramount. Storytellers, bards, and elders preserve faction history, moral lessons, and technical knowledge through song, poetry, and memorized narratives. Nomad griots and Church preachers are masters of this art, capable of reciting hours-long epic poems from memory.
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Religion & Spirituality</h2>

        <h3>The Bound Faith (Church of Absolution)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church is the dominant organized religion, teaching that the Sundering was divine punishment for humanity's hubris. Salvation comes through <strong>penance, sacrifice, and submission</strong> to divine will (as interpreted by Church hierarchy).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Daily practice:</strong> Morning and evening prayer (approximately 15 minutes). Weekly confession of sins. Monthly participation in Blood Offerings (ritual self-harm to demonstrate devotion). Annual Pilgrimage Day (travel to nearest Church shrine).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Clergy roles:</strong> Priests hear confessions and lead services. Paladins enforce Church law. Exorcists combat Void corruption. Saints (rare) are individuals who achieve divine grace through extreme self-sacrifice.
        </p>

        <h3>Animism & Folk Beliefs</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Outside Church control, many communities practice animistic spirituality:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancestor Worship (Ossuarium):</strong> The dead remain spiritually active. Offerings to ancestors ensure their protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature Spirits (Elven Covenant):</strong> Trees, rivers, and mountains possess consciousness. Elves commune with these spirits through meditation and ritual.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Spirits (Dwarven):</strong> Tools and Caskets contain latent consciousness. Treating them well earns their cooperation.</li>
            <li><strong>The Wandering Gods (Nomad):</strong> Deities are travelers like mortals, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Faith is fluid and personal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Void Cults</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Fringe groups worship the Void itself, believing it to be a transformative force or a sentient deity. These cults are universally persecuted but persist in shadows, promising "ascension through dissolution."
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Entertainment & Leisure</h2>

        <h3>What Do People Do for Fun?</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Leisure time is scarce, but communities find ways to relax:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Evening gatherings where elders recount history, legends, and ghost stories</li>
            <li><strong>Music:</strong> Improvised instruments (drums from scrap metal, flutes from bone, stringed instruments from salvaged wire). Folk songs evolve regionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Gambling:</strong> Dice games, card games (using hand-drawn decks), and betting on Casket arena matches</li>
            <li><strong>Arena Combat:</strong> Formal duels between Caskets or warriors. Major settlements host weekly matches. Betting is rampant.</li>
            <li><strong>Festivals:</strong> Seasonal celebrations marking harvests, solstices, or factional holidays. Involve feasting (when possible), music, and ritual</li>
            <li><strong>Art:</strong> Murals painted on settlement walls, sculptures from scrap metal, and textile art. Exchange settlements have thriving art markets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Alcohol & Intoxicants</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Ashbrew:</strong> Fermented ashgrain beer. Low alcohol content (~3-4%), bitter taste, but cheap and ubiquitous.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Voidwine:</strong> Distilled spirits made from mutated fruit. Potent (40-50% alcohol) and mildly hallucinogenic. Popular but risky—consumption can trigger Void-touched visions.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Fungal Tobacco:</strong> Dried fungal spores smoked in pipes. Produces mild euphoria and relaxation. Legal in most factions, heavily taxed by the Exchange.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Soulstone Dust:</strong> Powdered Soulstone fragments inhaled or ingested. Produces intense sensory experiences and temporary psychic abilities. Highly addictive, illegal in most jurisdictions, but black markets thrive.
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Crime & Justice</h2>

        <h3>Common Crimes</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theft:</strong> Food, water, tools, and Soulstones are common targets. Penalties range from fines to amputation depending on faction.</li>
            <li><strong>Murder:</strong> Surprisingly rare—communities are small enough that everyone knows everyone, making concealment difficult. When it occurs, usually involves faction conflicts or personal vendettas.</li>
            <li><strong>Desertion:</strong> Abandoning a settlement without permission (leaving comrades vulnerable). Punished harshly in militaristic factions.</li>
            <li><strong>Void Trafficking:</strong> Selling or distributing Void-corrupted items. Capital offense in most factions.</li>
            <li><strong>Black Market Trade:</strong> Selling restricted goods (Soulstones, weapons, contraband) without authorization. Penalties vary widely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Justice Systems by Faction</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Church:</strong> Confessional justice. Sinners confess to priests, who assign penance (physical labor, self-flagellation, pilgrimage). Severe crimes result in excommunication or execution by immolation.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Exchange:</strong> Transactional justice. Criminals pay fines proportional to damage caused. If unable to pay, they enter debt servitude until the debt is cleared. Murder = lifetime of servitude to victim's family.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Dwarven:</strong> Trial by council. Accused and accusers present evidence to a council of elders, who vote on guilt and appropriate punishment. Emphasis on restitution over retribution.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Nomad:</strong> Exile. Serious crimes result in banishment from the Collective. Without community support, exiles rarely survive long.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Ossuarium:</strong> Soul binding without consent. Criminals who cannot pay restitution are executed and reanimated as undead laborers, their Soulstones bound into eternal servitude.
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Death & Burial Customs</h2>

        <h3>Church of Absolution</h3>
        <p>The dead are cremated in ceremonial pyres, ashes scattered at Church shrines. Soulstones extracted from the deceased are kept by the Church for "safeguarding" (often sold or redistributed). Funerals include confession of the deceased's sins and prayers for absolution.</p>

        <h3>The Ossuarium</h3>
        <p>Voluntary necromantic binding is common. Individuals pre-arrange to be reanimated after death, continuing service to their community as undead. Those who die without such arrangements are cremated, but Soulstones are claimed by the state. Funerals celebrate the "rebirth" into undeath.</p>

        <h3>Elven Verdant Covenant</h3>
        <p>Sky burial. Bodies are placed on elevated platforms or treetops, where scavengers consume the flesh. Bones are collected and buried beneath sacred trees, "returning to the cycle." Soulstones are dissolved in acidic fungal vats, releasing the bound soul "back to nature."</p>

        <h3>Dwarven Forge-Guilds</h3>
        <p>Entombment in stone crypts deep underground. Dwarves believe the earth preserves memory. Soulstones are incorporated into memorial statues or preserved in family vaults. Funerals are somber, multi-day affairs with continuous vigil.</p>

        <h3>Nomad Collective</h3>
        <p>Mobile cairns. Bodies are burned, ashes placed in small urns carried by the Collective as it travels. When the Collective passes through a significant location, they scatter a handful of ashes, "sharing the journey." Soulstones are kept by family or offered to worthy inheritors.</p>

        <h3>Vestige Bloodlines</h3>
        <p>Consumption. In a practice that disturbs outsiders, Bloodlines consume parts of their dead (cooked, with ritual preparation). They believe this transfers genetic memory and mutations to survivors. Soulstones are worn as amulets.</p>
