        <h2>Faction Overview</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The fae do not declare war. They simply appear, and settlements die. Tricksters, oath-keepers, and reality-benders who find the post-apocalypse endlessly amusing. Masters of bargains and contracts, they pilot Caskets woven from living wood and crystal, bending space and stealing faces with equal ease.

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Bargain Tokens</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Wyrd Conclave manipulates reality through <strong>Bargain Tokens</strong>—a resource earned by making deals and spent to warp reality itself.
        </p>

        <h3>Bargain Token Economy</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Generation:</strong> Bargain Struck (1/turn passive), Fae Bargain (3 if enemy accepts), Phase Cut (1 on kill)</li>
            <li><strong>Spending:</strong> Stolen Face (3 tokens), Reality Fracture (4 tokens), Mirror Self (5 tokens)</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> 10 tokens (tokens persist across missions)</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Force enemies into lose-lose choices, bank tokens for emergency survival</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reality-Bending Abilities</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Reality Fracture:</strong> Rewind your entire turn (undo mistakes, try again)</li>
            <li><strong>Stolen Face:</strong> Copy enemy cards permanently (become them)</li>
            <li><strong>Shimmer Step:</strong> Teleport 8 hexes and attack (impossible positioning)</li>
            <li><strong>Price Paid:</strong> Spend all tokens to survive death (bargain with fate)</li>
            <li><strong>Impossible Geometry:</strong> Phase through terrain and enemies (ignore physics)</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: #BA55D3;">&#10047;</span>
        </div>

        <h2>Playstyle</h2>

        <h3>1. REALITY BARGAIN (Token Generation)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Frame Type:</strong> Scout (6 SP per turn)
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Complexity:</strong> Very High (meta-manipulation, rule-breaking mechanics)
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategy:</strong> Reality-bending control through illusions, teleportation, and temporal manipulation. Force enemies into bargains with hidden costs. Steal identities and abilities. Rewrite combat outcomes through time manipulation. Every mechanic breaks normal game rules—high skill ceiling, extremely rewarding when mastered.
        </p>

        <h3>Win Conditions</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Bargain Economy:</strong> Generate massive tokens, force enemies into deals, snowball advantage</li>
            <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> Steal enemy cards with Stolen Face, build deck by absorbing enemies</li>
            <li><strong>Illusion Army:</strong> Create Mirror Selves and confuse enemies (they attack fakes while you strike)</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Manipulation:</strong> Rewind bad turns, take extra turns, redirect damage through time</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

        <h2>Key Casket Types</h2>

        <h3>Fae Blade (Primary Weapon, 6 cards, 1 Equipment Slot)</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Masquerade (Trickster Frame):</strong> Light Scout chassis (6 SP), piloted by Mockingbird. Excels at illusions, teleportation, and stolen identities. Primary weapons focus on Bargain generation and reality manipulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Changeling Frame:</strong> Medium chassis (5 SP), impersonation specialist that steals enemy abilities through Stolen Face. Can become any defeated enemy, inheriting their cards and tactics.</li>
            <li><strong>Contract Keeper:</strong> Heavy Vanguard (4 SP), binds enemies in supernatural oaths with horrific penalties. Forces enemies into lose-lose bargains—refuse and suffer the Coward's Mark, accept and owe impossible debts.</li>
            <li><strong>Mirror Walker:</strong> Scout chassis specializing in illusion multiplication. Creates Mirror Selves (perfect duplicates) that enemies cannot distinguish from the original. Excels at confusion warfare.</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: #BA55D3;">&#10047;</span>
        </div>

        <h2>Signature Cards</h2>

        <h3>Faction Cards (Choose 6 from 10)</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Fae Bargain:</strong> Force enemy into lose-lose choice. If they refuse, gain 1 Bargain token. If they accept, gain 3 Bargain tokens but they choose a debuff for you. The choice is always bad, but the reward is worth it.</li>
            <li><strong>Stolen Face (3 Bargain tokens):</strong> Copy an enemy's card permanently. Look at their hand, steal one card, and if you kill them this mission, keep it forever. Identity theft incarnate.</li>
            <li><strong>Reality Fracture (4 Bargain tokens):</strong> Rewind your entire turn. Undo all actions, restore spent SP, try again. Time manipulation at its finest.</li>
            <li><strong>Shimmer Step (2 SP):</strong> Teleport up to 8 hexes and immediately attack. Impossible positioning that breaks combat geometry.</li>
            <li><strong>Mirror Self (5 Bargain tokens):</strong> Create a perfect duplicate. Enemies cannot tell which is real. Both can attack. If one dies, the other survives.</li>
            <li><strong>Price Paid (0 SP, Reactive):</strong> When reduced to 0 HP, spend all Bargain tokens to survive with 1 HP per token spent. Bargain with death itself.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Phase Cut:</strong> Deal 3 damage, ignore armor. If this kills the target, gain 1 Bargain token. Blade that cuts through reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Impossible Geometry:</strong> Move through enemies and terrain as if they weren't there. Attack from inside obstacles. Physics is negotiable.</li>
            <li><strong>Bargain Struck (Passive):</strong> Gain 1 Bargain token at start of turn. Automatic, no cost, always active. Fae passively manipulate reality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Secondary Equipment (Choose 6 from 5)</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Stolen Armor:</strong> +2 Defense. Changes appearance to match the last enemy who attacked you. Confuses enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Reality Anchor:</strong> Immune to being moved or teleported by enemy abilities. You control your position, not them.</li>
            <li><strong>Trickster's Cloak:</strong> Teleport 4 hexes as a Reactive action when attacked. Dodge by vanishing.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Shimmer Phantom:</strong> 1 HP illusion decoy that draws enemy attacks. When destroyed, teleport your real Casket to the Phantom's location. Perfect bait-and-switch.</li>
            <li><strong>Bargain Broker:</strong> 10 HP support unit that generates Bargain tokens. Offers enemies deals mid-battle. Token economy accelerator.</li>
            <li><strong>Stolen Soldier:</strong> 12 HP doppelganger that copies enemy units. Becomes a mirror of your opponent's forces. Identity theft on the battlefield.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">

            <li><strong>The Un-Thing:</strong> Eldritch horror that shouldn't exist. Enemies who look at it take sanity damage. Corrupts reality around it. Nightmare made manifest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <h3>Mockingbird (The Mirthless)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A fae noble who wears stolen faces like masks. They change identity mid-conversation, speaking in the voices of your dead loved ones. Mockingbird finds tragedy hilarious and comedy tragic. They pilot "The Masquerade" - a Casket that reflects what you fear most.
        </p>

        <h3>The Bargain-Keeper</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            An ancient fae contract lawyer who enforces deals made centuries ago. Appears in settlements demanding payment for oaths their ancestors swore. Those who refuse? Their shadows are taken as collateral. The shadow-less cannot enter buildings or cast reflections. They fade within a year.
        </p>

        <h3>Lady Shimmer-In-Twilight</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A fae duchess who treats war as theater. She narrates battles like a play, critiquing combatants' performances. "Poor form! That parry lacked panache. Two stars." If you displease her, she erases you from memory - everyone forgets you existed.

        <h2>Lore: The Uninvited Guests</h2>

        <h3>Origins: Refugees from Sanity</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The fae are not from Earth. They are from the Feywild - a parallel dimension where physics is polite suggestion and causality is a rude joke. Before the Sundering, the Veil Accords kept them contained. The Material World was boring. Predictable. <em>Logical</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Then Theslar activated The Engine (Year 0). Reality tore. The Veil shattered. For the first time in millennia, the Feywild and Material World bled together. The fae poured through like water through a cracked dam.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            They found a broken world. Cities in ruins. Survivors desperate. Magic running wild. To the fae, it was <strong>paradise</strong>. Finally, the Material World was <em>interesting</em>.

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Wyrd Conclave does not want to "win" the war. Victory is boring. They want the game to continue indefinitely. They sabotage peace treaties, resurrect defeated factions, and keep conflicts balanced. If one side gets too strong, the fae help the underdog - not out of mercy, but to prolong the entertainment.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            To a fae, mortals are chess pieces. Watching you struggle, suffer, and die is <em>delightful</em>. They make deals knowing you'll fail. They offer help that makes things worse. They're not evil - they're amoral. Your pain is their comedy.
        </p>

        <h3>The Shimmerlands: Territory of Madness</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Where the Feywild overlaps with the Material World, you get the <strong>Shimmerlands</strong> - zones where reality is negotiable. Gravity shifts direction. Colors taste like sounds. Your reflection argues with you. Clocks run backwards on Tuesdays.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Mortals who enter Shimmerlands rarely return unchanged. Some forget their names. Others return speaking in riddles. A few come back <em>improved</em> - faster, stronger, cursed with knowledge they didn't want. The fae call it "enlightenment." Mortals call it madness.
        </p>

        <h3>Major Events</h3>

        <h4>Year 3 - The First Bargain</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A desperate Church commander, surrounded by Abominations, accepted a fae bargain: "We'll save your battalion in exchange for one favor, to be called in later." The fae saved 200 soldiers. Fifty years later, they called in the favor: "Kill the Church's High Cardinal." The commander did. The Church has never trusted the fae since.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 89 - The Court of Stolen Children</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The fae established the <strong>Court of Stolen Children</strong> - a territory where they raise human orphans as their own. These "Changelings" grow up thinking they're fae. They pilot Caskets made of living wood and crystal. The Church calls them abominations. The fae call them "adopted family." The Changelings? They don't know what they are.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 287 - The Prank War</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A Dwarven engineer insulted a fae duchess, calling her "frivolous." She declared a Prank War. For six months, Dwarven forges produced cursed weapons: swords that sang lullabies mid-swing, shields that apologized when hit, Caskets that only moved backwards. The Dwarves sued for peace. The duchess accepted their surrender... and turned their king into a teapot for a year. "He needed to learn humility."
        </p>

        <h4>Year 412 - The Bargain of Names</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Exchange tried to negotiate a trade agreement with the Wyrd Conclave. The fae agreed - in exchange for "a name." The Exchange Guild Proctors thought they meant a signature. The fae meant <em>their actual names</em>. Three Guild Proctors lost their names that day. They still exist, but no one remembers them. Records erase themselves. Faces blur in photographs. They are ghosts in their own lives.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Goals (Year 437)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Wyrd Conclave wants the war to last forever. They secretly fund losing factions, leak intelligence to underdogs, and assassinate leaders who sue for peace. War is their entertainment. Peace would end the game.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            However, a troubling development: The Engine's instability is growing. If it explodes, reality might stabilize. The Shimmerlands could close. The fae would be trapped in the Material World - or worse, sent back to the Feywild. For the first time in centuries, the fae are <em>worried</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Some fae want to stabilize The Engine (to keep their playground intact). Others want to detonate it (to see what happens). The Conclave is fractured. Civil war is brewing. And when the fae fight each other? <strong>Reality itself takes sides.</strong>

        <h2>Schisms & Renegade Courts</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Wyrd Conclave has always been fractured—fae politics are labyrinthine bargains and betrayals. These <strong>Schisms</strong> enable mirror matches—Wyrd vs Wyrd, trickster vs trickster. Both sides wield reality-bending power, but their <em>rules of theater</em> differ profoundly.
        </p>

            <h3 style="color: #BA55D3; margin-top: 0;">The Debt-Bound (Renegade Court)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> ALL interactions are bargains. Even breathing requires payment.</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Contract Famine of Year 276</em> - Bargain-Keeper Lireth declared that Wyrd fighting WITHOUT formal contracts was "theft of reality's fabric." She refused to aid allies unless they signed blood-pacts first, causing mass casualties when her Pack abandoned comrades mid-battle. The Conclave exiled her, but the Debt-Bound Court thrives in the shadows, enforcing "total contract economics."</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Wyrd:</strong> "Bargains are tools. Use them strategically for advantage."</li>
                <li><strong>The Debt-Bound:</strong> "Everything has price. No charity, no exceptions, no free actions. All debts must be paid."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Debt-Bound Caskets are covered in contract-scrolls, obsessive tally marks, and hyper-formal fae livery. They keep meticulous ledgers of every favor owed/given, turning warfare into bureaucracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extreme Bargaining:</strong> Only use Wyrd Token abilities when "bargaining" (flavor: never help without extracting cost)</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Hoarding:</strong> Hoard Wyrd Tokens obsessively, demanding payment for assistance</li>
                <li><strong>Contract Enforcement:</strong> Target enemies with Bargain Debt ruthlessly (collecting "fees")</li>
                <li><strong>Zero Charity:</strong> Never help allies freely—demand Wyrd Tokens or future favors first</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Wyrd:</strong> Debt-Bound view mainstream Wyrd as "diluting sacred contracts with casual trickery." When they clash, it's economic warfare: "You give power freely like fools. We enforce the ancient laws—all reality is debt."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Wyrd deck, but roleplay extreme transactionalism. Debt-Bound NEVER help without extracting payment (flavor only), hoard resources like misers, and treat every action as a binding contract.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #BA55D3; margin-top: 0;">The Face-Thieves (Rival Court)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Why create illusions when you can BECOME your enemy permanently?</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Dwarven Infiltration of Year 389</em> - Changeling operatives replaced 12 Dwarven pilots by stealing their faces and memories permanently, living as them for years. When discovered, the victims were already dead—their identities consumed. The Wyrd Council banished the Face-Thieves for "crossing into true murder" (fae don't kill, they trick). The outcasts claim "why return what you steal? Keep the best masks forever."</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Wyrd:</strong> "Steal faces temporarily. It's theater, not genocide. Return what you borrow."</li>
                <li><strong>The Face-Thieves:</strong> "Why give back power once taken? Permanent theft is perfect evolution."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Face-Thief Caskets are covered in enemy faction insignias, collected identity markers, and chaotic mix of stolen aesthetics. They're walking identity museums—horrifying collages of consumed personas.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aggressive Mimicry:</strong> Use Wyrd Token abilities to mimic enemy mechanics constantly</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Parasitism:</strong> Focus on stealing/copying enemy strengths (Stolen Faces ability spam)</li>
                <li><strong>No Theater Rules:</strong> Ignore "fae honor" (don't return faces, don't play fair)</li>
                <li><strong>Permanent Collection:</strong> Treat killed enemies as "identity trophies" (flavor: keeping their masks forever)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Wyrd:</strong> Face-Thieves view mainstream Wyrd as "cowards hiding behind temporary tricks." When they clash, it's existential: "You play dress-up and call it power. We CONSUME identity itself—we don't wear masks, we eat souls and become them."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Wyrd deck, but roleplay identity-consuming philosophy. Face-Thieves treat mimicry as permanent theft (flavor only), collect "trophies" from kills, and embrace being predators among tricksters.</p>
