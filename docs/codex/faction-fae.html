        <h2>Faction Overview</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The fae do not declare war. They simply appear, and settlements die. Tricksters, oath-keepers, and reality-benders who find the post-apocalypse endlessly amusing. Masters of bargains and contracts, they pilot Caskets woven from living wood and crystal, bending space and stealing faces with equal ease.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Wyrd Tokens</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Wyrd Conclave manipulates reality through <strong>Wyrd Tokens</strong>—reality distortions gained through bargains and spent to teleport, copy abilities, and rewrite combat outcomes.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Generate Tokens:</strong> Force enemies into bargains (take damage or grant you power)</li>
            <li><strong>Mirror Step:</strong> Teleport across the battlefield to allies, enemies, or reflective terrain</li>
            <li><strong>Stolen Reflection:</strong> Copy up to 3 enemy abilities and use them against their owners</li>
            <li><strong>What-If Paradox:</strong> Reactive defense that gambles on d6 rolls (negate damage or take double)</li>
            <li><strong>Oath-Binding:</strong> Force enemies into supernatural contracts with devastating penalties</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <h3>Mockingbird (The Mirthless)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A fae noble who wears stolen faces like masks. They change identity mid-conversation, speaking in the voices of your dead loved ones. Mockingbird finds tragedy hilarious and comedy tragic. They pilot "The Masquerade" - a Casket that reflects what you fear most.
        </p>

        <h3>The Bargain-Keeper</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            An ancient fae contract lawyer who enforces deals made centuries ago. Appears in settlements demanding payment for oaths their ancestors swore. Those who refuse? Their shadows are taken as collateral. The shadow-less cannot enter buildings or cast reflections. They fade within a year.
        </p>

        <h3>Lady Shimmer-In-Twilight</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A fae duchess who treats war as theater. She narrates battles like a play, critiquing combatants' performances. "Poor form! That parry lacked panache. Two stars." If you displease her, she erases you from memory - everyone forgets you existed.
        </p>

        <h2>Lore: The Uninvited Guests</h2>

        <h3>Origins: Refugees from Sanity</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The fae are not from Earth. They are from the Feywild - a parallel dimension where physics is polite suggestion and causality is a rude joke. Before the Sundering, the Veil Accords kept them contained. The Material World was boring. Predictable. <em>Logical</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Then Theslar activated The Engine (Year 0). Reality tore. The Veil shattered. For the first time in millennia, the Feywild and Material World bled together. The fae poured through like water through a cracked dam.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            They found a broken world. Cities in ruins. Survivors desperate. Magic running wild. To the fae, it was <strong>paradise</strong>. Finally, the Material World was <em>interesting</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>Philosophy: The Game Must Continue</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Wyrd Conclave does not want to "win" the war. Victory is boring. They want the game to continue indefinitely. They sabotage peace treaties, resurrect defeated factions, and keep conflicts balanced. If one side gets too strong, the fae help the underdog - not out of mercy, but to prolong the entertainment.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            To a fae, mortals are chess pieces. Watching you struggle, suffer, and die is <em>delightful</em>. They make deals knowing you'll fail. They offer help that makes things worse. They're not evil - they're amoral. Your pain is their comedy.
        </p>

        <h3>The Shimmerlands: Territory of Madness</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Where the Feywild overlaps with the Material World, you get the <strong>Shimmerlands</strong> - zones where reality is negotiable. Gravity shifts direction. Colors taste like sounds. Your reflection argues with you. Clocks run backwards on Tuesdays.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Mortals who enter Shimmerlands rarely return unchanged. Some forget their names. Others return speaking in riddles. A few come back <em>improved</em> - faster, stronger, cursed with knowledge they didn't want. The fae call it "enlightenment." Mortals call it madness.
        </p>

        <h3>Major Events</h3>

        <h4>Year 3 - The First Bargain</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A desperate Church commander, surrounded by Abominations, accepted a fae bargain: "We'll save your battalion in exchange for one favor, to be called in later." The fae saved 200 soldiers. Fifty years later, they called in the favor: "Kill the Church's High Cardinal." The commander did. The Church has never trusted the fae since.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 89 - The Court of Stolen Children</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The fae established the <strong>Court of Stolen Children</strong> - a territory where they raise human orphans as their own. These "Changelings" grow up thinking they're fae. They pilot Caskets made of living wood and crystal. The Church calls them abominations. The fae call them "adopted family." The Changelings? They don't know what they are.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 287 - The Prank War</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A Dwarven engineer insulted a fae duchess, calling her "frivolous." She declared a Prank War. For six months, Dwarven forges produced cursed weapons: swords that sang lullabies mid-swing, shields that apologized when hit, Caskets that only moved backwards. The Dwarves sued for peace. The duchess accepted their surrender... and turned their king into a teapot for a year. "He needed to learn humility."
        </p>

        <h4>Year 412 - The Bargain of Names</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Merchant Guilds tried to negotiate a trade agreement with the Wyrd Conclave. The fae agreed - in exchange for "a name." The Merchants thought they meant a signature. The fae meant <em>their actual names</em>. Three Guild Proctors lost their names that day. They still exist, but no one remembers them. Records erase themselves. Faces blur in photographs. They are ghosts in their own lives.

        <h3>Current Goals (Year 437)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Wyrd Conclave wants the war to last forever. They secretly fund losing factions, leak intelligence to underdogs, and assassinate leaders who sue for peace. War is their entertainment. Peace would end the game.

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            However, a troubling development: The Engine's instability is growing. If it explodes, reality might stabilize. The Shimmerlands could close. The fae would be trapped in the Material World - or worse, sent back to the Feywild. For the first time in centuries, the fae are <em>worried</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Some fae want to stabilize The Engine (to keep their playground intact). Others want to detonate it (to see what happens). The Conclave is fractured. Civil war is brewing. And when the fae fight each other? <strong>Reality itself takes sides.</strong>
