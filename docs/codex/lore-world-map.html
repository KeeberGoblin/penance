        <h1>Theslar in Year 437: Political Geography & Territorial Control</h1>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "The map is a lie. Borders shift daily. Today's ally controls the valley; tomorrow's enemy claims the ruins. The only certainty is the Void—it expands while we squabble over ash and stone."
            <span class="quote-attribution">— Cartographer Lyssa Venn, Exchange Geographical Survey, Year 421</span>
        </div>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Pre-Sundering maps are relics of a dead world. Coastlines have shifted, mountain ranges have collapsed, and entire regions have been swallowed by Void rifts. The political geography of Year 437 is fluid, contested, and constantly renegotiated through warfare, trade, and survival necessity. This page documents current territorial control, major settlements, travel routes, and resource distribution across Theslar's scarred landscape.

        <h2>The Siberian Pole: Understanding Theslar's Geography</h2>

        <div style="background: rgba(75, 14, 14, 0.2); padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 3px solid var(--dark-red); margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0;">
                <strong>Critical Note for GMs:</strong> Theslar's geography is <strong>not</strong> Earth-standard. The north pole is located in central Siberia, creating a rotated climate map. This affects where ice forms, which regions are habitable, and how factions distribute themselves across the world.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Pole Shift: Why Siberia is North</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Whether Theslar always had this orientation or the Sundering caused catastrophic axial tilt is debated by scholars. What matters for Year 437:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Central Siberia is the North Pole</strong> - The coldest point on the planet</li>
            <li><strong>Ground Zero (Theslar Engine) is in the Siberian Ice Cap</strong> - 2,000km from the pole center</li>
            <li><strong>Ice coverage radiates outward</strong> from Siberia, not from the Arctic Ocean</li>
            <li><strong>Climate zones are rotated</strong> - Former "Arctic" regions (Scandinavia, Alaska) are now temperate</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Climate Zones (Year 437, Post-Stabilization)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            After 437 years, the planet has reached new climate equilibrium following the Ashfall Winter and subsequent greenhouse effects. Global average temperature: <strong>5-7°C cooler</strong> than pre-Sundering baseline.

        <h3>The Siberian Ice Cap (Polar Dead Zone)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The ice cap covering central Siberia is <strong>3-5km thick</strong> in places, formed over 437 years of perpetual winter. Key features:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Ground Zero (Theslar Engine)</strong> - Encased in 4km of ice, but Void pulses melt surrounding area creating unstable glacier caves</li>
            <li><strong>Void Radiation</strong> - Strongest at pole, weakens with distance (exponential decay)</li>
            <li><strong>Crimson Aurora</strong> - Visible year-round from pole, fades beyond 4,000km</li>
            <li><strong>No Settlements</strong> - Closest outpost is Coldharbor (Ossuarium) at 3,200km from pole</li>
            <li><strong>Exploration Expeditions</strong> - Annual suicide missions to Ground Zero; 90% never return</li>

                <strong>GM Note:</strong> The Siberian Ice Cap is a narrative tool for high-level campaigns. "Journey to Ground Zero" is the ultimate endgame mission—shutting down the Engine permanently. Most campaigns never reach this point.

        <h2>Territorial Overview by Faction</h2>

        <h3>Church of Absolution (Tier 1 Superpower)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> Cathedral Prime (former Paris, France)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Western Europe (France, Low Countries, Western Germany, Northern Spain)<br>
            <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> Temperate (0-20°C range, ~3,800km from Siberian pole)<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 2.4 million<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> Approximately 800,000 km²
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Cathedral Prime</strong> (Paris) - 600,000 residents, heavily fortified, temperate farmland</li>
            <li><strong>Penitent's Gate</strong> (Brussels) - 150,000 residents, military staging ground</li>
            <li><strong>Ashborne Shrine</strong> (Lyon) - 80,000 residents, pilgrimage site</li>
            <li><strong>Port Absolution</strong> (Bordeaux) - 60,000 residents, Atlantic naval base</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> Western Europe's temperate climate post-Siberian pole shift makes it ideal for agriculture. Mild winters (0°C) and warm summers (20°C) allow year-round farming. Pre-Sundering infrastructure (Paris, Brussels) provided foundation for Cathedral Prime. Distance from pole (3,800km) means low Void radiation but close enough to access Soulstone deposits from eastern expeditions.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Temperate farmland (Loire Valley, Flanders), iron deposits (Pyrenees), timber (Ardennes forests), Atlantic fishing waters, salvage from dense pre-Sundering cities
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> East: buffer zones with Ossuarium (contested Rhineland). South: Mediterranean trade with Exchange. West: Atlantic Ocean (shipping lanes). North: North Sea (limited naval activity).
        </p>

        <h3>The Ossuarium (Tier 1 Superpower)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> The Necropolis (former Moscow, Russia)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Eastern Europe and Western Russia (subarctic/taiga belt)<br>
            <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> Subarctic (-10°C winter, 15°C summer, ~2,500km from Siberian pole)<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 800,000 living + 12,000 Caskets<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> Approximately 1.5 million km²
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Necropolis</strong> (Moscow) - 300,000 living, 4,000 Caskets - underground crypt-city</li>
            <li><strong>Bonefield</strong> (St. Petersburg) - 150,000 living, 3,000 Caskets - industrial necromancy center</li>
            <li><strong>Coldharbor</strong> (Murmansk) - 50,000 living, 2,000 Caskets - staging ground for polar expeditions</li>
            <li><strong>Frostmarrow</strong> (Urals foothills) - 80,000 living, 1,500 Caskets - mining outpost</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> Proximity to Siberian Ice Cap (2,500km) provides access to high-concentration Soulstone deposits. The undead labor force thrives in subarctic cold—frozen corpses preserve better, eliminating decay issues. Taiga forests provide timber. Most importantly: they're closest to Ground Zero, allowing Bonelord Karath's expeditions to harvest souls from Void rift zones. The cold is irrelevant to Caskets.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Unlimited undead labor (12,000 Caskets work 24/7 without rest), Soulstone refineries (highest purity in world due to proximity to pole), taiga timber, Ural mineral deposits, monopoly on polar expedition supplies
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> West: contested buffer with Church (Rhineland, Poland). East: Arctic Tundra (encroaching ice, nomadic Emergent Syndicate scouts). South: trade corridor with Exchange. North: Siberian Ice Cap (uninhabitable beyond Coldharbor).
        </p>

        <h3>Dwarven Forge-Guilds (Tier 2 Regional Power)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> The Deepvault (former Scandinavian Mountains, Norway/Sweden)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Scandinavian mountain range, Alps, Carpathians (vertical sovereignty underground)<br>
            <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> Temperate/Subarctic transition (~3,200km from Siberian pole)<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 1.2 million<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> 600,000 km² surface claim, but ~2 million km² underground tunnel network
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Deepvault</strong> (Scandinavian Mountains) - 500,000 residents, capital, 20 vertical levels deep</li>
            <li><strong>Ironhearth</strong> (Alps) - 350,000 residents, metallurgy center, 15 levels deep</li>
            <li><strong>Forgedeep</strong> (Carpathian Mountains) - 250,000 residents, weapons manufacturing hub</li>
            <li><strong>Runestone Hold</strong> (Central Scandinavia) - 100,000 residents, runic research facility</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> Mountain ranges are ideal defensible terrain for Dwarves. Scandinavia's position (3,200km from pole) puts it in the temperate/subarctic transition—cold enough to discourage surface invasion, but underground geothermal keeps cities warm. Rich mineral deposits (iron, copper, rare earths) remain accessible. The mountains survived the Sundering structurally intact, unlike collapsed plains cities. Underground aquifers provide unlimited fresh water.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Rich mineral deposits (iron, copper, tin, rare earth elements), underground aquifers (cleanest water in world), geothermal power (unlimited energy), defensible terrain (surface attacks nearly impossible), master runecraft expertise, vertical sovereignty (tunnels extend 1,000km+ underground)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> Dwarven territory is defined by mountain ranges rather than surface borders. They maintain "vertical sovereignty"—underground tunnels extend far beyond surface-level political boundaries, creating tension with neighbors. Surface borders: West with Scandinavian coast (abandoned), East with Ossuarium buffer zones, South with Church and Exchange territories. Their tunnel network secretly extends beneath multiple faction territories, a strategic advantage they guard jealously.
        </p>

        <h3>The Exchange (Tier 2 Regional Power)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> The Vault (former Zurich, Switzerland)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Trade corridor network across Central Europe and Mediterranean (non-contiguous)<br>
            <strong>Climate Zones:</strong> Temperate (Alps) to Mediterranean (Italy, Turkey)<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 800,000 (distributed across multiple settlements)<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> ~400,000 km² direct control (cities + corridors), but trade influence spans 2 million km²
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Vault</strong> (Zurich, Alps) - 250,000 residents, financial center, vault storage, ~4,000km from pole (Temperate)</li>
            <li><strong>Tradehaven</strong> (Frankfurt, Rhine Valley) - 200,000 residents, largest market in Europe, ~3,900km from pole (Temperate)</li>
            <li><strong>Portmarket</strong> (Genoa, Italy) - 180,000 residents, Mediterranean trade hub, ~4,200km from pole (Mediterranean)</li>
            <li><strong>Silk's End</strong> (Istanbul, Turkey) - 170,000 residents, gateway to eastern trade, ~3,600km from pole (Mediterranean)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> The Exchange occupies the "crossroads of civilization"—the temperate zone where Church, Ossuarium, Dwarves, and southern Mediterranean trade routes intersect. Zurich's location (4,000km from pole) provides mild climate ideal for year-round trade. Pre-Sundering Switzerland was a financial hub with massive vault infrastructure (banks, bunkers, gold reserves), all intact post-Sundering. The Alps provide natural fortification. Mediterranean access via Genoa enables global shipping.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Pre-Sundering financial records and wealth caches (gold, gems, bearer bonds), extensive trade networks spanning all major factions, mercenary forces (hired from all factions), information brokerage (spies embedded in every capital), neutral ground for diplomatic negotiations, monopoly on pre-Sundering luxury goods (wine, art, jewelry)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> The Exchange doesn't control continuous territory. Instead, they maintain "trade corridors"—fortified roads connecting their settlements, with watchtowers and mercenary patrols every 50km. These corridors pass through Church, Ossuarium, and Dwarven lands via negotiated treaties. The Exchange pays "passage taxes" but maintains autonomy within corridor zones (100m either side of road). Violating corridor neutrality is considered an act of war by all factions, making the corridors sacrosanct.
        </p>

        <h3>Elven Verdant Covenant (Tier 2 Regional Power)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> Roothold (former Amazon Basin, Brazil)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Amazon rainforest remnants and scattered forested enclaves globally<br>
            <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> Tropical (~8,000-9,000km from Siberian pole, equatorial)<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 500,000<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> ~2 million km² (Amazon primary territory) + scattered enclaves totaling ~300,000 km²
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Roothold</strong> (Amazon Basin) - 200,000 residents, living tree-city, built into thousand-year-old growth</li>
            <li><strong>Canopy Watch</strong> (Congo Basin remnants, Africa) - 120,000 residents, secondary enclave, tropical rainforest</li>
            <li><strong>Greenreach</strong> (Pacific Northwest, former USA/Canada) - 80,000 residents, temperate rainforest enclave</li>
            <li><strong>Scattered Groves</strong> - ~50 small settlements (500-2,000 residents each) in forested regions globally, total ~100,000</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> The Amazon survived the Sundering better than most ecosystems. Being 8,000km+ from the Siberian pole, it remained in the tropical zone despite global cooling—still warm (25-30°C year-round) with high rainfall. The dense canopy protected against Void radiation, and ley line intersections in the Amazon Basin created pockets of reality stability. Elves thrive in forests and reject urban civilization, making the Amazon's isolation ideal. The Sundering actually strengthened the Amazon ley node, attracting Elves from dying forests globally.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Timber (sustainable harvest from thousand-year oaks), medicinal plants (Amazon biodiversity includes Void-resistant species), fungal cultivation (spores adapted to Void corruption), ley line access (Amazon node is strongest globally, enables powerful ritual magic), biological diversity (unique flora/fauna found nowhere else), stealth and guerrilla warfare expertise (forest terrain advantage)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> Elven territory is difficult to map. The Amazon "belongs" to the Covenant, but enforcement is minimal beyond 200km from Roothold. They tolerate Nomad passage and small human settlements as long as they don't engage in deforestation or hunting protected species. Scattered enclaves have no formal borders—Elves simply claim "the forests" within regions, leading to disputes when loggers or settlers encroach. Elven archers enforce boundaries through silent warning shots, escalating to lethal force only against repeat offenders.
        </p>

        <h3>Nomad Collective (Tier 3 Minor Faction)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> The Wandering (mobile settlement, no fixed location)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> None (nomadic, claims right-of-passage through most regions)<br>
            <strong>Climate Zones:</strong> All zones (mobile), but concentrates in Subtropical/Mediterranean (Central Asia, North Africa)<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 1.8 million<br>
            <strong>Range:</strong> Global, but primary routes through Central Asian steppe, Mediterranean rim, North African deserts
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements (Mobile):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Wandering</strong> - 600,000 residents, massive caravan spanning 50km, vehicles/animals/Caskets/wagons</li>
            <li><strong>Dust Convoys</strong> - 30+ smaller caravans (10,000-50,000 each) scattered globally, total ~900,000</li>
            <li><strong>Waystation Camps</strong> - Semi-permanent camps at oases and trade crossroads (~300,000 seasonal residents)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here (Everywhere):</strong> Nomads thrive in the post-Sundering world because fixed settlements are vulnerable to Void rifts, resource depletion, and faction wars. The Wandering follows a 3-year circuit across Central Asia (former Kazakhstan, Iran, Turkey, North Africa), staying in the Mediterranean/Subtropical zones (4,000-5,500km from pole) where climate is manageable but population density is low. They avoid the frozen north (too cold) and tropical jungles (too dense for caravans). The steppe and desert are ideal—flat, open, with scattered oases for water.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Mobility (can relocate 1,000+ km in weeks, avoiding threats), adaptability (survive any climate temporarily), extensive trade networks (connect all factions, know best routes), salvage expertise (strip ruins as they pass), Void rift knowledge (they map rift activity as they travel, selling maps to settled factions), cultural neutrality (accepted by all factions as mediators)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> None. Nomads negotiate passage rights with each faction they traverse via annual treaties. Most factions tolerate Nomad caravans because they provide valuable trade (exotic goods from distant lands), information (news, rumors, warnings), and neutral mediation (disputes settled by Nomad elders). Conflicts arise when Nomads settle temporarily on contested land, deplete local water sources, or harbor fugitives. The Wandering is too large to attack without massive casualties, serving as deterrent.

        <h3>Vestige Bloodlines (Tier 3 Minor Faction)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> The Mutation Yards (former Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Void-corrupted wastelands and radiation zones (scattered enclaves globally)<br>
            <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> Temperate (Chernobyl ~3,000km from pole), but climate irrelevant—radiation zones uninhabitable to non-mutants<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 250,000<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> ~150,000 km² (uninhabitable to non-mutants)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Mutation Yards</strong> (Chernobyl, Ukraine) - 100,000 residents, mutant sanctuary, built inside reactor ruins</li>
            <li><strong>Glowmarsh</strong> (Fukushima, Japan) - 60,000 residents, Pacific mutant enclave, coastal irradiated zone</li>
            <li><strong>Blightwood</strong> (Three Mile Island, USA) - 40,000 residents, Atlantic enclave</li>
            <li><strong>Scattered Cells</strong> - Dozens of small communities (500-2,000 each) in radiation zones globally, total ~50,000</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> Bloodlines inhabit zones lethal to baseline humans—nuclear exclusion zones, Void rift epicenters, chemical wastelands. Chernobyl (3,000km from pole, Temperate zone) became their capital not for climate, but because pre-Sundering radiation plus Void corruption created ideal conditions for mutation adaptation. The reactor ruins shield against external threats while the radiation keeps invaders out. Only mutants with radiation resistance can survive long-term. This makes their territory inherently defensible—no conquest possible without dying of exposure.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Radiation-tolerant biology (can work in zones lethal to others), adaptation to Void corruption (some bloodlines immune to Void madness), access to pre-Sundering facilities in exclusion zones (intact nuclear reactors for power, research labs with undisturbed data, military bunkers), biological diversity (each bloodline has unique mutations—regeneration, night vision, toxic secretions, etc.), Soulstone scavenging in Void epicenters (no competition)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> Bloodlines don't enforce borders—most factions avoid their territories due to radiation and Void contamination. Unofficial policy: "If you can survive here, you're welcome here." This makes Bloodline territory a refuge for outcasts, criminals, Void-sensitive individuals, and anyone fleeing faction justice. The Mutation Yards accepts all refugees, no questions asked. However, survival rate for non-mutants is under 10% within the first year. Those who stay either adapt (develop mutations) or die.
        </p>

        <h3>Emergent Syndicate (Tier 3 Minor Faction)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> The Hive (former Cambodia, Southeast Asia)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Southeast Asian jungle and expanding into Arctic periphery<br>
            <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> Tropical (~6,500km from pole), but expanding into Subarctic (2,000-3,000km from pole)<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 150,000 (hive collective, individuality unclear—may be one distributed consciousness)<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> ~400,000 km² (Cambodia core) + expansion nodes totaling ~100,000 km²
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Hive</strong> (Cambodia jungle) - 80,000 residents, bio-organic city, living architecture</li>
            <li><strong>Silk Nest</strong> (Vietnam coast) - 40,000 residents, secondary hive cluster, aquatic adaptation experiments</li>
            <li><strong>Expansion Nodes</strong> (Arctic periphery near Siberia) - 5 frontier outposts, total ~20,000, testing cold adaptation</li>
            <li><strong>Scattered Pods</strong> - Dozens of small bio-domes (100-500 each) in remote areas, total ~10,000</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> The Syndicate chose Cambodia (6,500km from pole, Tropical zone) because dense jungle provides biomass for their bio-organic architecture. The Hive "grows" rather than builds—living structures that breathe, self-repair, and adapt. High humidity and warmth accelerate bio-growth. But the Syndicate is expanding north toward the Siberian Ice Cap, establishing cold-adapted nodes in the Arctic periphery. Their goal: reach Ground Zero and integrate with the Theslar Engine itself. This expansion terrifies the Ossuarium, who view it as existential threat.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Bio-organic architecture (self-repairing, self-sustaining, grows without labor), hive coordination (perfect information sharing across all members via pheromone/telepathic network), adaptation to Void environments (some members can survive direct Void exposure for hours), rapid population expansion (can grow new members from bio-pods in 6 months), Void-organism symbiosis (integrate Void creatures into hive structure as living tools)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> Emergent borders expand aggressively. The Syndicate claims territory through "conversion"—establishing bio-organic infrastructure that gradually transforms the environment into hive-compatible biomass. Trees grow into living walls, rivers become nutrient arteries, soil becomes flesh-like substrate. This makes their borders fluid, alarming, and grotesque to neighbors. Current expansion vector: northeast into Sibarian Wastes, competing with Ossuarium for Void rift control. Some fear the Syndicate will consume the entire planet given enough time.
        </p>

        <h3>Wyrd Conclave & Fae Courts (Tier 3 Minor Faction)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> The Shimmerlands (former British Isles/Iceland dimensional overlap zone)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> "Dimensional overlap zones" (areas where Feywild bleeds into material reality)<br>
            <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> Temperate/Subarctic (Britain ~4,000km from pole, Iceland ~3,000km), but Feywild climate follows dream-logic<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> ~700,000 (400,000 Wyrd Conclave, 300,000 Fae Courts—distinct but allied sub-factions)<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> Unmappable (exists partially in material plane, partially in Feywild)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Shimmerlands</strong> (Britain/Iceland overlap) - 400,000 Wyrd Conclave residents, largest dimensional overlap</li>
            <li><strong>Twilight Marches</strong> (scattered globally) - 300,000 Fae Courts residents, dozens of smaller overlap zones</li>
            <li><strong>Court of Whimsy</strong> (mobile) - Ruling body, location shifts weekly, appears as impossible architecture</li>
            <li><strong>Dream Markets</strong> - Temporary manifestations at ley nodes where Fae trade with mortals</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> The Wyrd Conclave doesn't choose territory based on climate—they inhabit dimensional overlap zones where Feywild and material reality intersect. The Shimmerlands (Britain/Iceland, 3,000-4,000km from pole) became their primary territory because the Sundering tore reality there, creating permanent rifts between planes. The Fae Courts are scattered globally at ley line intersections—anywhere reality is thin. The Siberian pole itself has minimal Fae presence because Void corruption disrupts Feywild connections. They prefer temperate zones far from Ground Zero.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Reality manipulation (can warp physics within overlap zones—gravity, time, space), bargain-based contracts (binding magical agreements that cannot be broken, enforced by Feywild law), access to Feywild resources (materials that don't exist in material plane—dream-steel, starlight cloth, bottled emotions), information gathered through dreams and eavesdropping across dimensional boundaries (Fae can spy via dreams, see any location with sleeping occupants), immunity to conventional warfare (can phase into Feywild to avoid attacks)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> The Wyrd Conclave has no physical borders. They claim "dimensional sovereignty" over regions where Feywild and material plane overlap. These zones appear randomly, shift unpredictably, and are marked by strange phenomena (gravity anomalies, time dilation, impossible colors, objects aging backward). Most factions avoid these areas entirely. However, Fae Courts maintain "embassy zones" in major cities (Cathedral Prime, The Vault, etc.) where mortals can negotiate bargains safely.
        </p>

        <h3>Crucible Packs (Tier 4 Outlier)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> Ashveil (former North American volcanic zone, Yellowstone/Cascades)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> "The Scorched Reaches"—volcanic mountain range across former Western USA<br>
            <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> Varies—Temperate to Mediterranean (~5,500-6,500km from pole), but volcanic heat dominates locally<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> 600,000<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> ~200,000 km² (mountainous volcanic terrain)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Settlements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Ashveil</strong> (Yellowstone supervolcano caldera) - 300,000 residents, capital, built inside active caldera</li>
            <li><strong>Blast Temple</strong> (Mount St. Helens) - 150,000 residents, primary explosive manufacturing facility</li>
            <li><strong>Forge-Crag</strong> (Sierra Nevada volcanic zone) - 100,000 residents, metallurgy and weapons testing</li>
            <li><strong>Ember Watch</strong> (Cascade Range) - 50,000 residents, border fortress and trade depot</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here:</strong> The Crucible Packs inhabit the most geologically active region on the planet—the North American volcanic belt (5,500-6,500km from pole). The Sundering triggered massive volcanic eruptions, but the Packs adapted, building inside calderas where geothermal power is unlimited and volcanic minerals (sulfur, saltpeter, metals) are abundant. Yellowstone's supervolcano provides both danger and protection—only the Packs know safe routes through the lava tubes. The volcanic heat keeps climate temperate despite northern latitude. They thrive on risk.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Explosives expertise (absolute monopoly on advanced demolitions—no other faction can match their quality), volcanic minerals (sulfur, saltpeter, phosphorus for explosives), geothermal power (unlimited energy from magma chambers), fortified terrain (volcanic mountains nearly unassailable), metallurgy (volcanic forges produce ultra-high-quality steel), strategic neutrality (every faction needs their explosives, making them diplomatically untouchable)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> Crucible territory is limited to the volcanic mountain ranges. They have no interest in expansion beyond volcanic zones and maintain strict armed neutrality. Their explosive manufacturing monopoly gives them diplomatic leverage far beyond their size—every faction buys Crucible munitions, making invasion suicidal (attacking would cut off all factions from explosives supply). 50km exclusion zone around Ashveil enforced by threat of detonating munitions stockpiles (mutual destruction deterrent).
        </p>

        <h3>Draconid Remembrance (Tier 4 Outlier)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Capital:</strong> None (47 individuals scattered globally)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Hidden archives in remote, climate-stable locations<br>
            <strong>Climate Zones:</strong> Varied—archives placed in geologically stable regions across all zones<br>
            <strong>Population:</strong> ~50 (last surviving members of an ancient species)<br>
            <strong>Extent:</strong> N/A (no territorial claims)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Archive Locations (Known):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Himalayan Archive</strong> (Tibet, ~4,500km from pole, Temperate) - 5 Draconids, mountain vault</li>
            <li><strong>Antarctic Vault</strong> (South Pole, ~12,000km from pole, Polar opposite) - 3 Draconids, ice-locked archive</li>
            <li><strong>Amazon Deep Archive</strong> (Brazil, ~8,500km from pole, Tropical) - 4 Draconids, tolerated by Elves</li>
            <li><strong>Saharan Observatory</strong> (North Africa, ~5,000km from pole, Subtropical) - 6 Draconids, desert monastery</li>
            <li><strong>Unknown/Hidden Archives</strong> - Remaining ~30 Draconids (locations classified even from each other)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Why Here (Everywhere):</strong> Draconids don't choose territory for resources or climate—they archive in remote, geologically stable locations to preserve knowledge across apocalypses. Each archive is placed in a different climate zone as redundancy: if one region becomes uninhabitable (ice age, flooding, Void rifts), others survive. The Himalayan Archive (4,500km from pole, high altitude, temperate) is central and accessible. Antarctica (opposite pole) ensures preservation even if Siberian pole shifts. Amazon provides ley line stability. Sahara offers isolation. They planned for 50,000 years.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strategic Resources:</strong> Complete historical records spanning 50,000+ years (including pre-Theslar civilizations), Memory Crystals containing lost knowledge (magic systems, extinct technologies, forgotten languages), precognitive warnings about apocalyptic patterns (they've survived 14 previous apocalypses and can predict signs), immortality (Draconids age 1 year per century, functionally immortal), telepathic record-keeping (each Draconid is a living archive)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Borders:</strong> Draconids claim no territory. Their archives are hidden via illusion magic and defensive wards, and most factions are unaware of their exact locations. Those who discover a Draconid archive typically negotiate access rather than risk conflict—Draconids are few, but their knowledge is invaluable, and they possess ancient magic capable of erasing armies. Some leaders make pilgrimages to archives seeking guidance. The Draconids rarely refuse, but their advice is cryptic and long-term focused.

        <h2>Climate & Environmental Hazards</h2>

        <h3>Post-Sundering Climate Zones</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Global temperatures dropped 5-10°C after the Sundering due to volcanic ash and Void-induced atmospheric changes. This has created several distinct climate zones:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arctic Expansion:</strong> Permafrost extends 500-800km further south than pre-Sundering. Northern Europe experiences subarctic conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperate Contraction:</strong> Former temperate zones (France, Germany) now experience harsher winters and shorter growing seasons.</li>
            <li><strong>Tropical Resilience:</strong> Equatorial regions (Amazon, Congo, Southeast Asia) retain warmth but experience increased rainfall and flooding.</li>
            <li><strong>Desert Stability:</strong> Deserts (Sahara, Gobi) largely unchanged, but sandstorms intensify due to atmospheric instability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Environmental Hazards</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Void Storms:</strong> Localized reality distortions that manifest as weather phenomena. Can last hours to days, cause hallucinations and spatial warping.</li>
            <li><strong>Ash Fall:</strong> Periodic volcanic eruptions blanket regions in ash, poisoning crops and water supplies.</li>
            <li><strong>Radiation Zones:</strong> Pre-Sundering nuclear disasters (Chernobyl, Fukushima) plus Void-induced radiation create no-go zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Ley Line Surges:</strong> Sudden spikes in magical energy can cause spontaneous fires, mutations, or equipment failures.</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="background: rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.2); border: 2px solid var(--aged-gold); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

            <h3>Travel as Narrative Tool</h3>
            <p>Use travel times to create tension. A 60-day journey to The Necropolis is an adventure in itself—encounters with bandits, Void storms, and factional patrols along the way.</p>

            <h3>Resource Scarcity Drives Conflict</h3>
            <p>Factions go to war over clean water, farmland, and Soulstone deposits. Players can influence these conflicts by securing or sabotaging resources.</p>

            <h3>Borders Are Fluid</h3>
            <p>Don't treat borders as fixed. Factions expand and contract based on military success. A region that's Church-controlled in Session 1 might fall to Ossuarium forces by Session 10.</p>

            <h3>Exploration Rewards</h3>
            <p>Unclaimed territories (North America, Australia, interior Africa) offer rich salvage but extreme danger. Use these as high-risk, high-reward expedition zones.</p>
