        <h2>Species Origins</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church of Absolution is predominantly human, and humanity's origins trace back to natural evolution identical to our Earth. Though magic exists in this world, sensitivity to it is extraordinarily rare - only 1 in 10,000 humans can perceive ley lines naturally, and of those, merely 1 in 100 can manipulate them to become mages.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Before the Sundering, humans dominated numerically but lived in profound ignorance. They were unaware of the full extent of non-human species, believing elves and dwarves to be myths and folklore. Nikolas Theslar himself was human and had no idea his Engine would affect non-human civilizations hidden in the margins of the world.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Cataclysm struck, humanity interpreted the apocalypse through their cultural lens - heavily influenced by Abrahamic faiths. They saw the Sundering not as scientific catastrophe, but as divine punishment. This belief crystallized into the Church of Absolution's doctrine: that humanity's sins brought the world's end, and only through violent penance can absolution be earned.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Pre-Sundering:</strong> Billions of humans living in Industrial Age society, unaware of the arcane world hidden among them</li>
            <li><strong>The Veil:</strong> Mages, elves, and dwarves operated under secret Accords to remain hidden from mundane humanity</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Sundering:</strong> The dominant species in the Church and Penitent Kingdoms, building their faith on guilt for sins they didn't commit</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> "We did not die because we were unworthy. We died because the world demanded sacrifice."</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Humans built the Church from guilt and faith, seeking absolution for sins they didn't commit - punishing themselves for a catastrophe caused by one scientist's hubris. This drive for redemption through suffering defines every Church Casket pilot, every Penitent Knight, every Martyr willing to die for salvation.
        </p>

        <h2>Lore & Identity</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church of Absolution was founded 12 years after the Sundering by the first Penitent Knights who refused to accept that death was the end. They believe that Remnants exist in a state of purgatory—neither alive nor dead—and that only through violent atonement can they earn true rest.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church controls the southern territories through a combination of religious fervor and military might. Their Caskets are gothic war machines covered in scripture and prayer scrolls, piloted by the dead seeking forgiveness. Each kill is recorded as a prayer. Each wound taken is a step closer to salvation.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "In iron we seek forgiveness. Through blood, absolution. When the enemy falls, we are one step closer to redemption."

        <h2>The Dual Penance: Pilot and Soul</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Church doctrine teaches that Casket operation is a <strong>dual sacrifice</strong>—two entities suffering together for redemption:
        </p>

        <h3>The Living Pilot's Penance</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Church pilots undergo <strong>"The Shortening"</strong>—surgical removal of their legs at the hip. This allows them to fit into the cramped casket chamber while remaining alive and conscious. Unlike other factions who view amputation as pragmatic necessity, the Church considers it sacred mutilation:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Ritual:</strong> Performed in consecrated chapels with prayers of absolution. No anesthetic—the pain is part of the penance.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Amputation:</strong> Pilots use wheelchairs outside their Caskets, bearing their sacrifice visibly as a mark of devotion.</li>
            <li><strong>Theological Meaning:</strong> "We walk no more in sin. Our legs were instruments of earthly pride. Now we crawl closer to redemption."</li>
            <li><strong>The Straps:</strong> Inside the Casket, pilots are bound with consecrated leather straps, arms crossed like a corpse, viewing battle through a narrow armored slit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Bound Soul's Torment</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The <strong>Soulstone Core</strong> powering each Church Casket contains a soul—often a volunteer who died seeking absolution. Church doctrine views this as a continuation of penance beyond death:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Consecrated Cores:</strong> Church Soulstones are shaped into cross/reliquary forms, wrapped in gold filigree cages inscribed with prayers.</li>
            <li><strong>The Soul's Awareness:</strong> Church priests teach that the trapped soul can "hear" the pilot's prayers and finds peace in shared suffering.</li>
            <li><strong>Refinement as Sacrament:</strong> When feeding soul fragments to the Core during refinement, Church technicians recite blessings: "We consecrate these fragments. May their suffering purify the Core. This is mercy, not cruelty."</li>
            <li><strong>The Screaming:</strong> Unlike other factions who ignore or suppress the Core's screams, Church pilots are taught to <em>listen</em>—"The soul cries out in purification. Bear witness to its penance."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Shared Absolution Through Combat</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Every kill recorded is counted as a <strong>prayer for both pilot and soul</strong>. Church doctrine holds that when a Church Casket destroys an enemy, <em>both</em> the living pilot and the bound soul earn a step closer to redemption:

                <strong>The Theological Paradox:</strong> Critics (especially Elves) argue that the Church is <em>doubling</em> the horror—torturing both pilot <em>and</em> soul. Church response: "Two sinners bearing penance together is more holy than one suffering alone. We do not multiply torment—we share it."

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Blood Offering & Righteous Fury</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Church Caskets channel suffering into power through the <strong>Blood Offering</strong> system and scale infinitely through <strong>Righteous Fury</strong>.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Blood Offering:</strong> Discard 1 card from your deck (self-harm). Your next attack gains +3 damage, ignores 1 Defense, and has -1 to target number (easier to hit). <em>(Balance Oct 17: reduced from 2 cards)</em></li>
            <li><strong>Righteous Fury (Passive):</strong> Each time an allied Casket is destroyed, gain +1 damage to all attacks permanently for the rest of the mission (max +3 damage). <strong>(Balance Update Oct 19: Capped at +3 to prevent infinite scaling)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Base HP:</strong> 32 HP (higher than standard 30 HP). <strong>(Balance Update Oct 19: +2 HP to compensate for self-harm mechanics)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Martyrdom Protocol:</strong> Redirect damage from allies to yourself. Gain Heat but protect the faithful.</li>
            <li><strong>Divine Judgment:</strong> Execute low-HP targets with massive burst damage. Judgment delayed is judgment magnified.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church playstyle revolves around aggressive trades: sacrifice your own HP for devastating burst damage, protect allies to build Righteous Fury stacks, and turn suffering into absolution. High risk, high reward martyrdom.

        <h2>Schisms & Renegade Orders</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Like all powerful factions, the Church of Absolution has fractured into rival sub-orders over theological disputes. These <strong>Schisms</strong> enable mirror matches—Church vs Church, martyr vs heretic. Both sides pilot the same Caskets and use similar tactics, but their <em>reasons</em> differ profoundly.
        </p>

        <div style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(139, 0, 0, 0.1), rgba(100, 0, 0, 0.05)); border: 2px solid #660000; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
            <h3 style="color: #8B0000; margin-top: 0;">The Scourged (Renegade Order)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Pain IS salvation, not a path to it. Suffering itself is divine.</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Flagellation of Year 89</em> - Brother Caelix returned from a suicidal mission against Chitinous hives, but his Casket was so damaged it couldn't be piloted without constant agony. He declared this torment was "the Engine's true blessing" and founded a heretical sect believing that maximizing suffering—not killing efficiently—brings absolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Church:</strong> "Kill to earn salvation. Pain is the cost."</li>
                <li><strong>The Scourged:</strong> "Pain IS salvation. Killing is merely theater."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Scourged Caskets are covered in self-inflicted damage—exposed wiring, deliberately broken armor plating, pilots visible through cracked capsules. They pilot deliberately malfunctioning Caskets to maximize suffering.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extreme Blood Offering:</strong> Scourged spam Blood Offering even when inefficient, prioritizing self-harm over tactical advantage</li>
                <li><strong>Martyrdom Addiction:</strong> Use Martyrdom Protocol recklessly, even when allies don't need protection (craving the Heat/damage)</li>
                <li><strong>Reject Healing:</strong> Refuse to use Consecrated Ground on themselves—healing is "rejecting the gift of torment"</li>
                <li><strong>Masochistic Escalation:</strong> The more wounded they are, the more effective (inverse psychology—low HP = peak faith)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Church:</strong> The Scourged view mainstream Church as "false martyrs" who use pain as a tool rather than embracing it as truth. When Scourged and Church meet, it's theological warfare: "You weaponize suffering. We <em>become</em> it."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Church deck, but roleplay extreme self-destruction. Scourged pilots ALWAYS Blood Offering turn 1, spam Martyrdom Protocol, and deliberately stand in hazards. High-risk suicidal playstyle.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(139, 0, 0, 0.1), rgba(100, 0, 0, 0.05)); border: 2px solid #660000; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
            <h3 style="color: #8B0000; margin-top: 0;">The Bloodtithers (Rival Order)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Absolution requires specific sacrifices—only "worthy" kills count.</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Tithe Doctrine of Year 312</em> - High Confessor Thalia decreed that killing bandits, beasts, or lesser Remnants "pollutes the Prayer Count." Only killing rival Casket pilots, faction champions, or Abominations counts toward salvation. This caused a theological rift when she executed a Penitent Knight for "wasting prayers on unworthy targets."</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Church:</strong> "Every kill is a prayer. All violence brings redemption."</li>
                <li><strong>The Bloodtithers:</strong> "Only <em>worthy</em> blood absolves. Lesser kills are blasphemy."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Bloodtither Caskets have ornate kill-count scripture on their armor, but only elite kills are recorded. They wear crimson-and-gold livery instead of standard gray.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Selective Targeting:</strong> Bloodtithers prioritize enemy Caskets/Elites over Swarm units (mechanically identical, but flavored as "honor duels")</li>
                <li><strong>Execute Obsession:</strong> Spam Divine Judgment constantly (executing wounded elites "purifies the Prayer Count")</li>
                <li><strong>Righteous Fury Variant:</strong> Only trigger Righteous Fury bonus when killing <em>enemy pilots</em>, not NPCs (self-imposed restriction)</li>
                <li><strong>Duel Mentality:</strong> Bloodtithers seek 1v1 engagements rather than team tactics</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Church:</strong> Bloodtithers view mainstream Church as "diluting the purity of penance" by counting bandit kills and beast slaughter as salvation. When they fight each other, it's ideological: "Your prayers are lies. Only blood of equals counts."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Church deck, but focus Divine Judgment and aggressive dueling. Ignore Swarm enemies unless forced. Bloodtithers fight "honorably" (no cheap shots, always 1v1 when possible).</p>

        <h2>Strategy Notes</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Highest burst damage in game (Blood Offering + Divine Judgment), scaling damage (Righteous Fury +1 per ally death, max +3), excellent ally protection (Martyrdom Protocol, Consecrated Ground), resource recursion (Last Rites, Consecrated Ground recover cards), flexible builds (melee DPS, ranged support, tank, berserker).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Self-destructive mechanics (Blood Offering, Flagellant's Zeal harm you), Heat management issues (Martyrdom Protocol generates Heat), relies on allies for some mechanics (Last Rites, Righteous Fury), low sustain without Repair Sigil (self-harm spirals without healing), vulnerable when isolated (support mechanics need team).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Use Blood Offering turn 1 for alpha strike to establish early pressure. Position aggressively—Martyrdom Protocol lets you tank for allies. Save Consecrated Ground until you're at ~15 HP or allies need healing. Build board presence.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Trade HP for positioning and damage (you have healing tools). Use Divine Judgment as execute when enemy reaches 10 HP or less. Protect allies with Martyrdom Protocol to build Righteous Fury stacks. Control key hexes with Consecrated Ground zones.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> If Righteous Fury has reached max +3 damage (cap), you dominate the battlefield. Use Flagellant's Zeal for final desperate push (5 burst SP). Absolution if Heat critical (expensive but worth it). Last Rites turns ally deaths into massive card advantage. Blood Offering limited to 1 per turn prevents burst combos. Win through accumulated power and sacrifice. <strong>(Balance Update Oct 19: Righteous Fury now caps at +3, 32 HP base)</strong>

        <h3>Taint Exploitation System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Church pilots <strong>embrace Taint as a resource</strong> for martyrdom mechanics:
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Martyrdom Training:</strong> Church pilots start with Grit 1 (instead of 0) at character creation</li>
            <li><strong>Zealot Resistance:</strong> Corruption Save is <strong>3+</strong> instead of 4+ (zealotry protects from Engine corruption)</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Offering Taint:</strong> When you use Blood Offering, gain 1 Taint Marker (+3 damage buff worth the corruption risk)</li>
            <li><strong>Flagellant's Zeal Taint:</strong> When you use this Tactic, gain 2 Taint Markers (temporary SP burst for permanent corruption)</li>
            <li><strong>Taint Martyr Build:</strong> Deliberately stack Taint via Blood Offering, stand in Tainted terrain for positioning, spend Taint for Tainted Fury (+2 damage), weaponize corruption</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Church pilots treat Taint accumulation as a resource to manage, not a penalty to avoid. See <a href="rules-taint-exploitation.html" target="_parent">Taint Exploitation Rules</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Pilot Grit System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Church pilots gain <strong>+1 Grit at character creation</strong> (Martyrdom Training bonus):
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Starting Grit:</strong> 1 (instead of 0) - zealot conditioning makes them tougher from day one</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Grit:</strong> Still 3 (but reach it faster than other factions)</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophical Justification:</strong> "Pain is prayer. We are chosen to suffer." Church pilots are trained to endure wounds through zealotry</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanical Impact:</strong> Rookie Church pilots have 17% better chance to resist Pilot Wounds than other factions (4+ on 1d6+1 instead of 1d6+0)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            This bonus reflects Church doctrine: suffering builds character, pain purifies, and veterans of martyrdom are forged stronger. See <a href="campaign-pilot-grit.html" target="_parent">Pilot Grit Rules</a>.
