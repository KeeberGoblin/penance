<h1>The Theslar Engine</h1>

        <p style="font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            Also known as: The Theslar Engine (technical), The Engine (common usage). See <a href="javascript:parent.loadContent('lore-sundering.html');" style="color: var(--bone-white); text-decoration: underline;">The Sundering</a> for the full history of the Cataclysm.

        </div>

        <h2>What Is The Engine?</h2>

        <p>The Engine is a miles-high tower of corroded brass and crystalline structures, standing in the exact center of the <strong>Sibarian Wastes</strong>. It pulses with a rhythmic thrum that can be felt for hundreds of miles—a heartbeat of reality-tearing energy.</p>

        <h3>The Pulse</h3>

        <p>Every 6 hours, the Engine releases <strong>The Pulse</strong>—a wave of energy that:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Causes Soulstones within 100 miles to glow brightly</li>
            <li>Triggers Strain rolls for any active Caskets in the Wastes</li>
            <li>Spawns 1d6 Abominations near the Engine</li>
            <li>Can be felt as a distant tremor across the entire continent</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Engine's Threat Level</h2>

        <p>The Engine has an <strong>Instability Score</strong>, ranging from 0 (dormant) to 20 (catastrophic). If players ignore the Engine, it <strong>will</strong> destroy the world.</p>

        <h2>Player Choices: Five Endgames</h2>

        <p>Each faction wants something different from the Engine. Players must choose one of five paths, each with brutal consequences:</p>

        <h3>1. Siphon Power (Exploit)</h3>
        <p><strong>Cost</strong>: 500 Credits, 5 Scrap, 1 mission to install extractor</p>
        <p><strong>Effect</strong>: Generates 2 Soulstone Fragments per phase (massive income)</p>
        <p><strong>Consequence</strong>: Instability increases by +2 per phase (you're bleeding it dry, accelerating the apocalypse)</p>
        <p><strong>Faction Response</strong>: Forge-Guilds approve, Church condemns, Elves declare you enemies</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold);">Narrative: Short-term gain, long-term catastrophe. You're gambling with everyone's lives.</p>

        <h3>2. Stabilize Core (Repair)</h3>
        <p><strong>Cost</strong>: 300 Credits, rare components (requires 3 successful research missions)</p>
        <p><strong>Effect</strong>: Reduces Instability by 3, slows natural decay</p>
        <p><strong>Consequence</strong>: Soulstone production drops by 50% globally (prices skyrocket, everyone suffers)</p>
        <p><strong>Faction Response</strong>: Dwarves approve, Scrap-Clans are angry (they profit from chaos), Fae are amused</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold);">Narrative: You're buying time, but at the cost of the resource everyone depends on.</p>

        <h3>3. Destroy The Engine (Church Endgame)</h3>
        <p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1,000 Credits, suicide mission (high chance of pilot death)</p>
        <p><strong>Effect (Success)</strong>: Instability drops to 0. Void rifts seal. Abominations stop spawning.</p>
        <p><strong>Hidden Consequence</strong>: ALL Soulstones become inert. Caskets lose power. World reverts to pre-Cataclysm tech levels. Famine follows.</p>
        <p><strong>Effect (Failure)</strong>: Instability jumps to 18. You've made it worse.</p>
        <p><strong>Faction Response</strong>: Church celebrates, everyone else declares war on you</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold);">Narrative: You've "fixed" the problem... by removing magic entirely. Civilization collapses in a different way.</p>

        <h3>4. Control The Engine (Aberrant Endgame)</h3>
        <p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 pilot's life (permanently lost, merges with the Core)</p>
        <p><strong>Effect</strong>: Instability locks at 10. Player gains control of 1 The Pulse per mission—can trigger Void rifts, spawn Abominations, or energize Soulstones at will</p>
        <p><strong>Consequence</strong>: Merged pilot becomes an NPC—<strong>The New Theslar</strong>, a godlike entity with alien motivations</p>
        <p><strong>Faction Response</strong>: Everyone fears you. You've become the villain.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold);">Narrative: You've achieved godhood, but lost your humanity. The campaign continues with you as the final boss.</p>

        <h3>5. Redirect The Tear (Fae Endgame)</h3>
        <p><strong>Cost</strong>: A price determined by Mockingbird (see Iconic NPCs)—usually a soul, a memory, or a loved one</p>
        <p><strong>Effect</strong>: Instability drops to 5. The Void rift moves to the <strong>Feywild</strong>, becoming the Fae's problem</p>
        <p><strong>Consequence</strong>: Feywild and Material worlds merge partially—geography becomes unstable, time flows inconsistently, bargains become mandatory</p>
        <p><strong>Faction Response</strong>: Fae are delighted, everyone else is horrified</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold);">Narrative: You've traded one apocalypse for a different, stranger one.</p>

        <h2>Engine Hazards</h2>

        <h3>Void Exposure</h3>
        <p>Any pilot operating within <strong>5 hexes of the Engine</strong> suffers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>+1 Taint per round of exposure</li>
            <li>Strain rolls at -2 (increased malfunction chance)</li>
            <li>Heat does not vent naturally (must use active cooling)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Madness Effects (Taint 8+)</h3>
        <p>If a pilot reaches Taint 8+ while near the Engine, roll 1d6:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Visions</strong>: Pilot sees alternate timelines. -2 Initiative for the mission.</li>
            <li><strong>Compulsion</strong>: Pilot is drawn toward the Core. Must make a willpower check or move 1 hex closer each turn.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversion</strong>: Pilot begins to crystallize. Gain +1 Defense but lose 1 movement permanently.</li>
            <li><strong>Communion</strong>: Pilot hears the Engine "speaking." Gain 1 piece of forbidden knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Rejection</strong>: Pilot's body rejects the Soulstone. Lose 1 SP permanently.</li>
            <li><strong>Apotheosis</strong>: Pilot begins merging with their Casket. Gain +2 SP but cannot leave the Casket (ever).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Pulse (Timed Event)</h3>
        <p>Every 6 hours (in-game time), the Engine releases a Pulse. Players in the Wastes when a Pulse occurs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>All Caskets take 2 damage (ignores armor)</li>
            <li>All pilots gain +1 Taint</li>
            <li>Roll 1d6 per player:
                <ul>
                    <li>1-2: <strong>Void Rift Opens</strong> - 1d3 Abominations spawn in random hexes</li>
                    <li>3-4: <strong>Gravity Fluctuation</strong> - All movement costs +1 SP this round</li>
                    <li>5-6: <strong>Time Skip</strong> - 1 random player loses their next turn (frozen in looped time)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Narrative Pressure: Players have a ~2 hour window to complete objectives and escape before the next Pulse.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;"><span style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--dark-red);">&#10047;</span></div>

        <h2>The Core: The Wound</h2>

        <p>If players venture to the <strong>Engine's Core</strong> (the innermost chamber), they encounter <strong>The Wound</strong>—a tear in reality, 50 feet across, hovering in mid-air. Through it, you can see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Impossible colors that hurt to perceive</li>
            <li>Stars that shouldn't exist</li>
            <li>Reflections of yourself making different choices</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Looking at The Wound</strong>: Make a willpower check (roll 1d6, succeed on 4+)</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Success</strong>: Gain insight. Draw 2 cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Failure</strong>: Gain 2 Taint. Your character sees something they cannot unsee.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Control Mechanism</h3>
        <p>At the Core is a <strong>Runic Interface</strong>—the original controls Theslar used. Interactive elements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Power Regulator</strong> - Can be set from 1-10
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher setting = more Soulstone growth, higher Instability</li>
                    <li>Lower setting = less power, but Engine stabilizes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dimensional Anchor</strong> - Can be toggled On/Off
                <ul>
                    <li>Off = Void rift begins to close (Instability drops, but Soulstones die)</li>
                    <li>On = Current state</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Overload</strong> - Red lever, clearly labeled "DO NOT PULL"
                <ul>
                    <li>Triggers immediate The Pulse</li>
                    <li>Instability +3</li>
                    <li>Everyone in the zone takes 5 damage</li>
                    <li>??? (Players discover what happens if they pull it)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
