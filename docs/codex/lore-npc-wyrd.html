            </div>
            <p class="npc-description">
                The closest thing the Wyrd Conclave has to a leader, though fae governance is deliberately chaotic. Oberyn is the master of bargains—he drafts every major contract the Conclave offers, writing terms that TECHNICALLY fulfill agreements while devastating those foolish enough to sign. Example: "Grant me eternal life" → you live forever but age normally, spending centuries as decaying corpse. "Make me powerful" → you become physically strong but mentally infantile.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Oberyn appears as beautiful, androgynous humanoid with shifting features—sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes neither, face constantly flickering between stolen identities. He collects faces like others collect coins, wearing them as masks and discarding them when bored. His true face (if he has one) has been forgotten—possibly even by him.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"A bargain? Oh, how delightful. Do read the fine print. No? Your mistake, not mine."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Gleefully malicious, finds mortal desperation hilarious. Views contracts as games where mortals always lose. Genuinely believes he's being generous—after all, he honors every deal EXACTLY as written. Not his fault mortals don't understand implications.</p>
        </div>

            </div>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Twin fae who appear as giggling children but wield reality-bending power. They finish each other's sentences, share thoughts, and view the apocalypse as their personal playground. Mira specializes in spatial manipulation (teleporting armies into volcanoes, swapping enemy positions mid-battle). Moira specializes in temporal tricks (making battles repeat endlessly, aging enemies 50 years in seconds).
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                The Twins don't fight for territory or resources—they fight because it's FUNNY. They've triggered wars by swapping faction banners, caused friendly-fire incidents by making enemies look identical, and once made an entire Church battalion believe they were chickens for three days. When asked why, they just giggle. Attempts to negotiate with them fail—they get bored and wander off mid-sentence.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"Why did we do it? Because—" "—it was FUNNY!" [uncontrollable giggling]</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Chaotic, childish, utterly amoral. View suffering as entertainment. Cannot be reasoned with or controlled. Other fae fear them because even Oberyn can't predict their actions. Embody pure chaos—no agenda, no logic, just endless mischief.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="npc-card">

                <h2 class="npc-name">Whisper-Through-Thorns</h2>
                <span class="npc-title">The Veiled Oracle, Speaker of Hidden Truths</span>

            </div>
            <p class="npc-description">
                The Conclave's seer and most terrifying member. Whisper speaks only in riddles and prophecies that ALWAYS come true—but never in the way listeners expect. She appears as shrouded figure wrapped in living thorns, face hidden behind veil of shifting mist. Those who glimpse her true form go mad, claiming they saw "all possible futures at once, and none were good."
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Whisper's prophecies are sought by desperate leaders willing to pay terrible prices for glimpses of the future. But her prophecies are cursed—knowing the future ensures you cause it. Example: "Your son will betray you" → father becomes paranoid and abusive → son betrays him to end abuse. She finds this predictable irony endlessly amusing.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"You wish to know tomorrow? Very well. I see... ash. Mountains of ash. And in the ash, a throne. And on the throne... YOU sit. Satisfied?"</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Cryptic, sadistic, finds mortal attempts to avoid fate hilarious. Views prophecy as elaborate joke where mortals are always punchline. Speaks in metaphors that only make sense AFTER disaster strikes. Most dangerous fae because her words shape reality itself.</p>
