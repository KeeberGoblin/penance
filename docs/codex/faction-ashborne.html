            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                The Iron Doctrine were created <strong>accidentally</strong> in Year 0, when pre-Sundering rail workers near Ground Zero were caught in the Theslar Event. The Engine's first Pulse fused their souls to the locomotive they were maintaining, creating the first Immortal Train. But what began as accident became <strong>divine revelation</strong>: they believe the Engine <em>chose</em> them to spread its influence via railway networks.
            </p>
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">
                <strong>Faction Status:</strong> Tier 2 (Rising Power) - Fanatically expansionist, immortal, and rapidly growing their rail network by consuming scrap metal to forge new Pulse Rails. They are direct ideological enemies of the Wyrd Conclave: where Wyrd twists reality for amusement, the Iron Doctrine enforces Engine's rigid "natural order." They view Wyrd's bargains and tricks as <strong>heresy</strong> against the divine Pulse.

        <h2>Origins: The Immortal Accident (Year 0)</h2>

        <h3>The First Pulse</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Theslar Engine detonated at the North Pole, its first Pulse radiated outward at the speed of sound, carrying reality-warping energy. In Siberia, 340 miles south of Ground Zero, a freight train called <strong>"The Iron Promise"</strong> was transporting industrial equipment when the Pulse struck.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The 147 railway workers, engineers, and passengers aboard didn't die. They became something else:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Soul-Fusion:</strong> Their souls fused with the locomotive itself, creating a gestalt consciousness</li>
            <li><strong>Immortal Binding:</strong> They stopped aging, stopped needing food/water, but couldn't leave the train</li>
            <li><strong>Pulse Dependency:</strong> The Engine's six-hour Pulse became their heartbeat - miss it, and they weaken</li>
            <li><strong>Track Lockdown:</strong> They discovered they could only exist on railway tracks - stepping onto normal ground caused excruciating pain and rapid aging</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We felt the Engine's heartbeat before we understood what it meant. Six hours. Then the Pulse. Our bodies glowed. The locomotive <em>sang</em>. And we knew...we would never stop moving."
            <span class="quote-attribution">-Engineer Malik Ashward, First Conductor (Year 0, first journal entry)</span>
        </div>

        <h3>The Discovery (Year 0-12)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Over the next decade, The Iron Promise crew made horrifying discoveries:
        </p>

        <ol class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Immortality's Price:</strong> They stopped aging but couldn't leave the train. Attempts to disembark caused rapid aging (50+ years in minutes)</li>
            <li><strong>The Pulse Rails:</strong> Pre-Sundering rail tracks near Ground Zero had transformed into crystalline "Pulse Rails" that conducted Void energy</li>
            <li><strong>More Trains:</strong> Other locomotives caught in the Pulse had also become Eternal Trains, each with their own crew-gestalts</li>
            <li><strong>Soulstone Formation:</strong> The tracks they traveled left Soulstone residue - they were <em>creating</em> the resource other factions would kill for</li>
        </ol>

            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--dark-red);">&#10047;</span>
        </div>

        <h2>The Thirteen Eternal Trains</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            By Year 50, thirteen locomotives had been confirmed as Eternal Trains - immune to time, bound to the Rails, powered by the Engine's Pulse. Each developed unique characteristics based on their original crew and cargo.

            Pre-Sundering railway tracks within 500 miles of the Theslar Engine underwent transformation during Year 0. The metal rails crystallized, becoming conduits for Void energy. Every six hours, when the Engine pulses, these rails <strong>glow with eldritch light</strong> and transmit power to anything touching them.

                The Iron Doctrine views the <strong>Wyrd Conclave</strong> as ultimate heretics. Where Iron enforces Engine's "natural order" through rigid expansion and divine law, Wyrd manipulates reality itself for amusement. Doctrine priests call Wyrd bargains "twisting the Engine's sacred geometry." Wyrd response: "You worship a broken machine. We remake existence. Who's the heretic?"

            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <strong>Result:</strong> Open warfare whenever their territories overlap. Iron Doctrine lays tracks to "cleanse" Wyrd-touched lands. Wyrd responds by teleporting entire train sections into ravines, aging tracks 500 years in seconds, or swapping Conductor souls between trains (causing existential crises). Neither side can truly destroy the other - Iron keeps expanding, Wyrd keeps sabotaging. Stalemate through mutual incompatibility.

            Unlike other factions' Soulstone Caskets, Iron Doctrine pilots operate <strong>Rail-Walkers</strong> - mechanized suits powered by siphoned Pulse energy. These units are tethered to Pulse Rails and can only operate within 100 feet of active tracks.

        <h3>Rail-Walker Advantages</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Unlimited Power:</strong> No fuel costs while on Pulse Rails - draws energy directly from Engine</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Repair:</strong> Damage regenerates slowly (1 HP per hour) when stationary on rails</li>
            <li><strong>Void Immunity:</strong> Pilots are already corrupted/bound - cannot accumulate additional Taint</li>
            <li><strong>Pulse Synchronization:</strong> Every six hours, gain temporary +2 to all stats for 10 minutes (Engine Pulse buff)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rail-Walker Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Mobility Lock:</strong> Cannot leave Pulse Rails. Fight only on/near tracks.</li>
            <li><strong>Pulse Dependency:</strong> If separated from rails for 1+ hours, lose 1 HP per minute until death</li>
            <li><strong>Visible Signature:</strong> Void-Steam exhaust glows purple/violet - impossible to hide</li>
            <li><strong>Friendly Fire Risk:</strong> Unstable Pulse energy can damage allies not bound to Engine</li>

            <li><strong>"The Rails are Sacred"</strong> - The tracks are the Engine's veins. To damage them is blasphemy.</li>
            <li><strong>"Immortality is Service"</strong> - We did not choose eternal life. We accept it and serve the greater transit.</li>

        <h2>Campaign Hooks: Encountering the Iron Doctrine</h2>

        <h3>Scenario 1: The Last Stop</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Players must travel deep into Siberian Wastes to retrieve artifact near Ground Zero. Only route: ride an Iron Doctrine train for 5 days. Risk: stay 30 days = become Bound forever. Players must resist zealous priests offering "Engine's blessing" while navigating train politics and conversion pressure.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 2: Derailment Crisis</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Section of Pulse Rails damaged by Wyrd Conclave sabotage (reality warping aged tracks 500 years). Iron Doctrine cannot repair (too corrupted). Players hired to fix tracks before next Eternal Train arrives or face Doctrine wrath. Complication: Wyrd offers better payment to keep tracks broken.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 3: The Rogue Train</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            One Eternal Train, <strong>"The Grief Engine,"</strong> has gone silent for 10 years. Iron Doctrine command players (not request - they demand) to investigate. Discovery: entire crew was replaced by Wyrd imposters who drove train into Shimmerlands. Now it's trapped in reality loop, laying same 10-mile track forever.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 4: Junction Standoff</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Two Eternal Trains arrive at junction - one heading to expand into Wyrd territory, one returning from failed conquest. Iron Doctrine High Conductors demand players choose which expansion route to prioritize. Choice determines which faction territory gets invaded next.
        </p>

        <h2>Moral Complexity: Curse or Gift?</h2>

            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                The Iron Doctrine achieved what others spend fortunes seeking: <strong>immortality</strong>. They cannot age, cannot starve, cannot truly die (while on Rails). But they're also prisoners - unable to leave the trains, unable to settle, unable to choose stillness. Their "divine blessing" is eternal servitude.
            </p>
            <ul class="manuscript-list" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>Are they blessed?</strong> They've outlived the Sundering, witnessed 437 years of history, transcended mortality.</li>
                <li><strong>Are they cursed?</strong> They're bound to endless transit, watching passengers age and leave, trapped in metal wombs.</li>
                <li><strong>Are they free?</strong> They chose nothing (most were victims of Year 0) but accept their fate with grace.</li>
                <li><strong>Are they slaves?</strong> The Engine owns them. The Rails leash them. The Pulse feeds them. But is it slavery if you've forgotten what freedom felt like?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; font-weight: 700;">
                Players must decide: is this faction tragic victims, enlightened ascetics, or something beyond mortal judgment?
