            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                The Ashborne Engines were created <strong>accidentally</strong> in Year 0, when pre-Sundering rail workers near Ground Zero were caught in the Theslar Event. The Engine's first Pulse fused their souls to the locomotive they were maintaining, creating the first Immortal Train. Now, 437 years later, they patrol ancient rail networks, unable to stop moving, unable to age, unable to die.
            </p>
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">
                <strong>Faction Status:</strong> Tier 3 (Minor Power) - Isolated, immortal, technologically unique. They cannot participate in normal faction politics because they <em>literally cannot leave the trains or rails</em>. Most survivors believe they're ghost stories: phantom trains glimpsed in the wasteland, carrying impossible cargoes, crewed by undying passengers.

        <h2>Origins: The Immortal Accident (Year 0)</h2>

        <h3>The First Pulse</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Theslar Engine detonated at the North Pole, its first Pulse radiated outward at the speed of sound, carrying reality-warping energy. In Siberia, 340 miles south of Ground Zero, a freight train called <strong>"The Iron Promise"</strong> was transporting industrial equipment when the Pulse struck.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The 147 railway workers, engineers, and passengers aboard didn't die. They became something else:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Soul-Fusion:</strong> Their souls fused with the locomotive itself, creating a gestalt consciousness</li>
            <li><strong>Immortal Binding:</strong> They stopped aging, stopped needing food/water, but couldn't leave the train</li>
            <li><strong>Pulse Dependency:</strong> The Engine's six-hour Pulse became their heartbeat - miss it, and they weaken</li>
            <li><strong>Track Lockdown:</strong> They discovered they could only exist on railway tracks - stepping onto normal ground caused excruciating pain and rapid aging</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We felt the Engine's heartbeat before we understood what it meant. Six hours. Then the Pulse. Our bodies glowed. The locomotive <em>sang</em>. And we knew...we would never stop moving."
            <span class="quote-attribution">-Engineer Malik Ashward, First Conductor (Year 0, first journal entry)</span>
        </div>

        <h3>The Discovery (Year 0-12)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Over the next decade, The Iron Promise crew made horrifying discoveries:
        </p>

        <ol class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Immortality's Price:</strong> They stopped aging but couldn't leave the train. Attempts to disembark caused rapid aging (50+ years in minutes)</li>
            <li><strong>The Pulse Rails:</strong> Pre-Sundering rail tracks near Ground Zero had transformed into crystalline "Pulse Rails" that conducted Void energy</li>
            <li><strong>More Trains:</strong> Other locomotives caught in the Pulse had also become Eternal Trains, each with their own crew-gestalts</li>
            <li><strong>Soulstone Formation:</strong> The tracks they traveled left Soulstone residue - they were <em>creating</em> the resource other factions would kill for</li>
        </ol>

        </div>

        <h2>The Thirteen Eternal Trains</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            By Year 50, thirteen locomotives had been confirmed as Eternal Trains - immune to time, bound to the Rails, powered by the Engine's Pulse. Each developed unique characteristics based on their original crew and cargo.

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Pre-Sundering railway tracks within 500 miles of the Theslar Engine underwent transformation during Year 0. The metal rails crystallized, becoming conduits for Void energy. Every six hours, when the Engine pulses, these rails <strong>glow with eldritch light</strong> and transmit power to anything touching them.

        <h3>Rail-Walker Advantages</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Unlimited Power:</strong> No fuel costs while on Pulse Rails - draws energy directly from Engine</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Repair:</strong> Damage regenerates slowly (1 HP per hour) when stationary on rails</li>
            <li><strong>Void Immunity:</strong> Pilots are already corrupted/bound - cannot accumulate additional Taint</li>
            <li><strong>Pulse Synchronization:</strong> Every six hours, gain temporary +2 to all stats for 10 minutes (Engine Pulse buff)</li>

            <li><strong>Mobility Lock:</strong> Cannot leave Pulse Rails. Fight only on/near tracks.</li>
            <li><strong>Pulse Dependency:</strong> If separated from rails for 1+ hours, lose 1 HP per minute until death</li>
            <li><strong>Visible Signature:</strong> Void-Steam exhaust glows purple/violet - impossible to hide</li>
            <li><strong>Friendly Fire Risk:</strong> Unstable Pulse energy can damage allies not bound to Engine</li>

        <h2>Philosophy: The Doctrine of Perpetual Motion</h2>

        <h3>Core Tenets</h3>
        <ol class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>"The Engine Pulses, We Respond"</strong> - The Theslar Engine's heartbeat sustains us. We are extensions of its will.</li>
            <li><strong>"Stillness is Oblivion"</strong> - To stop moving is to sever from the Pulse. Movement = existence.</li>
            <li><strong>"The Rails are Sacred"</strong> - The tracks are the Engine's veins. To damage them is blasphemy.</li>
            <li><strong>"Immortality is Service"</strong> - We did not choose eternal life. We accept it and serve the greater transit.</li>
            <li><strong>"All Passengers Are Temporary"</strong> - Everyone disembarks eventually. Even us (through Final Stop).</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "Other factions fight over Soulstones, territories, ideologies. We fight for nothing. We simply <em>are</em>. The Engine made us. The Rails sustain us. The Trains carry us. This is not philosophy - it is fact."

            <li><strong>Population:</strong> ~200,000 Bound souls across 13 Eternal Trains</li>
            <li><strong>Territory:</strong> 47,000 miles of Pulse Rails across Siberian Wastes and beyond</li>
            <li><strong>Economy:</strong> Trade harvested Soulstones for supplies mortals need (clothing, tools, curiosities). Bound don't need food/water.</li>
            <li><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Regional enigma. Not aggressive but fiercely defend Rails from damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Secrecy:</strong> Most factions know they exist but avoid the Pulse Rails. "Ghost trains" are real.</li>

        <h3>Why Haven't They Been Destroyed?</h3>
        <ol class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Immortality:</strong> Bound cannot be killed permanently while on Pulse Rails. They regenerate.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Value:</strong> Ashborne harvest 40% of all Soulstones entering global markets. Attacking them = economic suicide.</li>
            <li><strong>Defensive Terrain:</strong> Pulse Rails only exist near Engine. Most factions won't venture into Wastes.</li>

        <h2>Campaign Hooks: Encountering the Ashborne</h2>

        <h3>Scenario 1: The Last Stop</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Players must travel deep into Siberian Wastes to retrieve artifact near Ground Zero. Only route: ride an Ashborne train for 5 days. Risk: stay 30 days = become Bound forever. Players must resist temptation of immortality while navigating train politics.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 2: Derailment Crisis</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Section of Pulse Rails damaged by Void rift. Ashborne cannot repair (too corrupted). Players hired to fix tracks before next Eternal Train arrives. Complication: repairs require Soulstone-infused materials. Cost vs. reward dilemma.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 3: The Rogue Train</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            One Eternal Train, <strong>"The Grief Engine,"</strong> has gone silent for 10 years. Ashborne request players investigate. Discovery: entire crew chose Final Stop simultaneously - train is empty but still moving, powered by Engine alone. What do players do with an ownerless immortal train?
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 4: Junction Standoff</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Two Eternal Trains arrive at same junction from opposite directions. Both refuse to reverse. Ashborne Conductors ask players to mediate 437-year-old grudge. Resolution determines which train controls valuable Soulstone harvesting route.

            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                The Ashborne achieved what others spend fortunes seeking: <strong>immortality</strong>. They cannot age, cannot starve, cannot truly die (while on Rails). But they're also prisoners - unable to leave the trains, unable to settle, unable to choose stillness.

                <li><strong>Are they blessed?</strong> They've outlived the Sundering, witnessed 437 years of history, transcended mortality.</li>
                <li><strong>Are they cursed?</strong> They're bound to endless transit, watching passengers age and leave, trapped in metal wombs.</li>
                <li><strong>Are they free?</strong> They chose nothing (most were victims of Year 0) but accept their fate with grace.</li>
                <li><strong>Are they slaves?</strong> The Engine owns them. The Rails leash them. The Pulse feeds them. But is it slavery if you've forgotten what freedom felt like?</li>
