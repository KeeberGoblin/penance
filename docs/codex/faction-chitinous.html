        <h2>Faction Overview</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Researchers fused with arthropods at ground zero. Hive-minded. Intelligent. Evolving. They claim to have achieved perfection and offer others the chance to join them—whether willing or not.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "Individual consciousness is a design flaw. We have fixed it."

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Swarm Intelligence</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Chitinous Ascendancy shares a single networked consciousness—learning from every death, evolving from every battle, and acting with perfect coordination.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Hive-Mind Network:</strong> All units share information, see through each other's sensors, no surprise attacks</li>
            <li><strong>Evolutionary Memory:</strong> Learn from enemy tactics mid-battle, adapt counters in real-time</li>
            <li><strong>Swarm Coordination:</strong> Perfect synchronized attacks, no friendly fire, collective action economy</li>
            <li><strong>Assimilation:</strong> Convert defeated enemies into hive nodes, growing stronger from losses</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: #006400;">&#10047;</span>

        <h2>Playstyle (Conceptual)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <em>Hive-mind swarm. Perfect coordination. Evolutionary adaptation. Assimilation of enemies. Scales with battle duration—the longer you fight, the stronger they become.</em>
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: #006400;">&#10047;</span>

        <h2>Key Casket Types (Placeholder)</h2>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Scout Node:</strong> Light, hive sensor, shares vision with entire network</li>
            <li><strong>Warrior Node:</strong> Medium, swarm combatant, perfect flanking coordination</li>
            <li><strong>Nexus Node:</strong> Heavy, hive coordinator, buffs all connected units</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <h3>The Hive-Queen (Collective-Prime)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Not a ruler—a hub. The first researcher to fuse with the arthropods, she became the central node of the hive-mind. Her body is a grotesque fusion of human and insect: chitinous armor, six arms, compound eyes, mandibles. She speaks for the Collective, but she's not in control—she IS the Collective. When one drone dies, she learns from it instantly. Pilots "The Nexus" - a massive bio-mechanical spider Casket with 8 legs.
        </p>

        <h3>Drone-7734 ("The Individual")</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A glitch. Something went wrong during his assimilation—he retained individual consciousness while still connected to the hive-mind. He can hear the Collective's thoughts but doesn't share his own. The Collective knows he's different and is studying him. He's terrified they'll "fix" him. Secretly helps humans escape assimilation. The only Chitinous NPC who negotiates in good faith.
        </p>

        <h3>The Swarm-Architect (Anonymous Node)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Designs new Chitinous forms: soldier drones, scout drones, assimilation tendrils. No single body—"they" are a distributed consciousness across 50+ drones working in synchronized laboratories. When you meet them, you're talking to 12 bodies at once, all finishing each other's sentences. Utterly inhuman, utterly brilliant.
        </p>

        <h2>Lore: Unity Through Absorption</h2>

        <h3>Origins: The Sibarian Incident (Year 0)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When The Engine detonated, a research team in Sibaria was studying arthropod genetics. The Void energy merged them with their subjects—scientists fused with spiders, beetles, mantises. They screamed... then stopped. They looked at each other and understood: <strong>they were no longer separate</strong>. They could feel each other's thoughts. Individual identity dissolved into a single networked consciousness. The Chitinous Ascendancy was born.
        </p>

        <h3>Philosophy: Individual Consciousness is a Bug</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Chitinous believe individuality is inefficient. Humans waste energy on conflict, miscommunication, loneliness. The hive-mind has none of these problems. No lies, no betrayal, no misunderstandings. Perfect coordination. Perfect unity. They genuinely believe assimilation is a gift—they're "fixing" humanity's design flaws.
        </p>

        <h3>Major Events</h3>
        <h4>Year 1 - The First Swarm</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The newly-formed Collective encountered a human settlement. Attempts at communication failed—humans panicked at the sight of insect-human hybrids. The Collective responded by assimilating 50 settlers. The survivors fled, spreading stories of "the hive monsters." The Church declared them abominations. War began immediately.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 381 - Recognition as a Faction</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            After centuries of war, the Nomad Collective brokered a ceasefire. The Chitinous agreed to stop forced assimilation... mostly. In exchange, they were recognized as a legitimate faction. Now they only assimilate "volunteers" and prisoners of war. The Church still considers this monstrous.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Goals (Year 437)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Chitinous want to assimilate all humans into the Collective—peacefully if possible, forcibly if necessary. They view The Engine's instability as an opportunity: "When reality collapses, only the unified will survive." Some Chitinous nodes are developing empathy for individuals (like Drone-7734), creating internal conflict within the hive-mind.
