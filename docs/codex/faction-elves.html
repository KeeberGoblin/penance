        <h2>Species Origins</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elves are <strong>Homo Sylvanus</strong> - a divergent human evolution shaped by prolonged ley line exposure over 50,000+ years. Their physiology reflects millennia of symbiotic adaptation to forest environments and magical energies.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 300-400 years, enabled by cellular regeneration enhanced by ambient ley line energy</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Senses:</strong> Vision extending into infrared spectrum, hearing sensitive to subsonic frequencies, heightened awareness of environmental changes</li>
            <li><strong>Symbiotic Biology:</strong> Incorporated chlorophyll analogs into their cells, allowing them to supplement nutrition through sunlight (though they still require traditional food)</li>
            <li><strong>Magical Attunement:</strong> Not inherently magical, but their nervous systems are naturally aligned with ley line flows, making spellwork instinctive rather than studied</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-Sundering Population:</strong> Only approximately 200,000 globally, compared to billions of humans</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Before the Sundering, elves lived in profound isolation. Their enclaves existed in remote forests and mountain groves - places like Roothold and The Grove of First Light - hidden from human civilization. To surface humans, they were legends, folklore, or "lost tribes" at best. The few humans who stumbled upon elven settlements were either welcomed (rarely) or turned away with memory-wiping glamours (more commonly).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elves viewed humans as "young, loud, and careless" - a species that burned through resources and lives without thought for consequences. The Veil Accords kept the peace: elves remained hidden, and humanity remained ignorant. This separation worked for thousands of years.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Post-Sundering Tragedy:</strong> When the Cataclysm struck, elven fertility dropped catastrophically. Void energy disrupted their symbiotic biology, severing the connection between their cells and the natural ley line flows. Elven women can no longer conceive. The species is dying out, generation by generation.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Verdant Covenant formed from desperation - a final alliance of surviving elven enclaves trying to heal the wounded world before their species goes extinct. Every battle is fought knowing their people have perhaps 200 years left. They are the gardeners tending a dying forest, pruning away disease with surgical precision, hoping to restore balance before the final leaf falls.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            This is why elves fight with such calculated ruthlessness. They have no future. They can only preserve what remains and ensure that when they are gone, something beautiful survives them.
        </p>

        <h2>Lore & Identity</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Once guardians of ancient groves, the Elven Verdant Covenant watches their forests rot 437 years after the Sundering. Year 223 marked the Betrayal at Roothold...the Church burned 40% of their territory in a single night. The elves persist through stubbornness and rage, wielding nature's dying fury against those who would finish what the apocalypse started.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elven Caskets are grown, not built. Living wood, thorns, and vines intertwine with metal frameworks. Pilots merge with their machines through organic integration...roots pierce flesh, bark encases bone. They are assassins wrapped in nature's wrath, striking from shadows and vanishing before retaliation.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We did not ask for this curse. We tend the dying, honor the fallen, and bleed those who trespass. Each cut is deliberate. Each poison, perfected."
            <span class="quote-attribution">-Archdruid Sylara Thornwhisper</span>

        <h2>The Mourned Necessity: Root-Grafted Pilots</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Elven Verdant Covenant approaches Casket piloting with profound reluctance. Unlike the Church (who embrace suffering as penance) or Dwarves (who celebrate engineering efficiency), Elves view neural thread integration as <strong>necessary desecration</strong>...a violation of natural symbiosis forced upon them by a broken world.
        </p>

        <h3>Root-Grafting: Living Wood Prosthetics</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elven pilots undergo <strong>"Root-Grafting"</strong>...the surgical removal of legs, replaced with living vine prosthetics. This procedure reflects Elven philosophy: if flesh must be sacrificed, replace it with <em>growing</em> material, not dead metal.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Amputation Site:</strong> Legs removed at mid-thigh (femur). Bone is cleanly severed, flesh trimmed to leave space for root integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Graft Material:</strong> Living vines from the <em>Verdant Mother Tree</em> (ancient oak at the heart of Roothold). Each pilot's vines are unique...genetically matched to their biology.</li>
            <li><strong>Rooting Process:</strong> Vines are surgically inserted into femoral stumps, where they <em>grow into bone marrow</em> over 4-6 weeks. Roots fuse with skeletal structure, creating permanent biological connection.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Graft Mobility:</strong> Pilots can walk using root-leg prosthetics, but at half-speed (3 hexes per turn instead of 6). Roots are strong but inflexible compared to muscle-driven legs.</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="background: rgba(75, 14, 14, 0.1); padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; border: 1px solid #228B22;">
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <strong>The Living Difference:</strong> Unlike Church wheelchairs or Dwarven lifts, Elven root-legs are <em>alive</em>. They photosynthesize in sunlight, require watering, and can be "pruned" for health. Pilots describe feeling "rooted" when standing...a sense of connection to the ground beneath them.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Neural Thread Dilemma</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elves philosophically oppose drilling metal threads through living flesh. Their solution: <strong>Living Thread Variants</strong>...bio-engineered vines grafted directly to pilots' nerves.

        <h3>The Grafting Ceremony</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Unlike other factions' clinical surgeries, Elven Root-Grafting is a <strong>sacred ritual</strong>:
        </p>

        <ol class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>The Vigil (Day 1):</strong> Pilot fasts for 24 hours in a sacred grove, meditating on sacrifice and necessity. Archdruid blesses the Mother Tree and harvests pilot-matched vines.</li>
            <li><strong>The Severance (Day 2, Dawn):</strong> Legs are amputated with herbal anesthesia (conscious but pain-dulled). Severed legs are buried beneath Mother Tree as offering. Pilot watches ceremony, bearing witness to their loss.</li>
            <li><strong>The Grafting (Day 2, Noon):</strong> Living vines are sutured to femoral stumps. Roots are guided into bone marrow using Elven growth-song (ritualized chant that accelerates cell division). Pilot remains conscious, feeling roots "take hold."</li>
            <li><strong>The Rooting (Days 3-42):</strong> Pilot rests in healing chamber filled with moss and nutrient-rich soil. Roots grow 1-2cm per day, fusing with bone. Neural thread vines are grafted to fingertips during Week 2.</li>
            <li><strong>The First Walk (Day 43):</strong> Pilot takes first steps on root-legs. Archdruid offers prayer: "You are half-tree now. May your roots find purchase. May your leaves remember sunlight."</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Living With Root-Legs</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elven pilots describe their prosthetics as <strong>symbiotic partners</strong>, not replacements:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Sunlight Dependency:</strong> Root-legs require 4-6 hours of sunlight daily. Pilots who stay indoors too long experience "root rot" (fungal infection, painful decay).</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Sensitivity:</strong> Roots grow faster in spring/summer (requiring frequent pruning), go dormant in winter (pilots move slower in cold climates).</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Attunement:</strong> Pilots report feeling the Mother Tree's "mood" through their roots...calm when the forest is healthy, anxious when danger approaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Photosynthetic Bonus:</strong> Root-legs supplement nutrition. Pilots can survive on half-rations if exposed to full sunlight 8+ hours daily.</li>
            <li><strong>Watering Rituals:</strong> Pilots must "water themselves" daily...pouring nutrient solution over root stumps (intimate, vulnerable act most perform in private).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "My legs are gone. In their place, roots from the Mother Tree. I water them each morning. They grow leaves in spring. When I stand in sunlight, I feel connected to something larger than myself. This is not prosthetics...this is symbiosis. And I mourn what I lost to gain it."

This prevents dissociation and honors the grief inherent in their transformation.

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Bleed Stacking</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elven Caskets apply <strong>Bleed counters</strong> that deal damage-over-time. Bleed stacks up to a maximum of 8 counters and never expires. <strong>(Balance Update Oct 19: Reduced from 10 to 8 stacks)</strong>
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Bleed Counters:</strong> Enemies take 1 damage per Bleed counter at START of their turn (before they can act).</li>
            <li><strong>Stacking with Cap:</strong> Bleed 1 + Bleed 2 + Bleed 3 = Bleed 6 total on target. <strong>Maximum 8 Bleed stacks per target</strong> (prevents runaway scaling). <strong>(Balance Update Oct 19: Reduced from 10)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Never Expires:</strong> Counters last entire mission. Enemies slowly bleed to death.</li>
            <li><strong>Faction Bonus:</strong> All Elven weapons automatically apply Bleed 1 on hit (in addition to card effects).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text" style="font-size: 0.9rem; opacity: 0.8; font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold);">
            <strong>⚖️ Balance Note:</strong> 10 Bleed counter cap prevents infinite scaling in extended fights while maintaining Elves' identity as DoT specialists.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Elven strategy is simple: apply Bleed to all enemies, then survive while they die to damage-over-time. High mobility and regeneration allow Elves to outlast the slow death they inflict.

        <h2>Schisms & Exiled Groves</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Verdant Covenant splinters over philosophical divides: preserve what remains, or weaponize nature's dying fury? These <strong>Schisms</strong> enable mirror matches...Elf vs Elf, guardian vs avenger.
        </p>

        <div style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(139, 0, 0, 0.1), rgba(100, 0, 0, 0.05)); border: 2px solid var(--dark-red); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
            <h3 style="color: var(--dark-red); margin-top: 0;">The Thornblood Exiles (Renegade Grove)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Nature must be weaponized, not protected. Vengeance over preservation.</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Roothold Massacre of Year 223</em> - When the Church burned 40% of elven forests, Elder Thornblood proposed corrupting the forest itself...turning sacred groves into carnivorous killing fields. The Verdant Covenant rejected this as "perverting what we protect." Thornblood's followers split off, embracing mutation, aggressive overgrowth, and weaponized nature.</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Elves:</strong> "Preserve the balance. Heal the wounded world."</li>
                <li><strong>The Thornbloods:</strong> "Balance is dead. Only wrath remains. Let the forest devour them all."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Thornblood Caskets are grotesque...bark fused with exposed muscle tissue, thorns growing through pilot flesh, bleeding vines. Their forests are hostile: man-eating plants, spore clouds, carnivorous trees.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aggressive Bleed:</strong> All attacks apply +1 Bleed (Thorn Strike becomes Bleed 3 instead of 2)</li>
                <li><strong>No Regeneration:</strong> Cannot use Photosynthesis or Verdant Regeneration (rejected healing in favor of offense)</li>
                <li><strong>Carnivorous Terrain:</strong> Forest hexes deal 2 damage to ALL units (including allies) but Thornbloods ignore this</li>
                <li><strong>Berserk Fury:</strong> At 10 HP or below, gain +3 damage to all attacks (low HP = maximum aggression)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Covenant:</strong> Thornbloods view guardians as "cowards clinging to a dying dream." They fight to prove vengeance is survival. "You tend the garden. We are the thorns that tear flesh from bone."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Elven deck, but maximum aggression. No defensive play, no healing, only relentless Bleed stacking and suicide charges. Glass cannon assassins.</p>

        <h2>Strategy Notes</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Best damage-over-time in game (Bleed stacks to 8 max), high mobility (Leaf Dance 2 hexes, Shadow Step, teleports), moderate regeneration (Verdant Regeneration 2 cards/round), surgical strikes (Pruning Cut targets specific components), area control (Root Bind, Vine Walls, Seed Pods). <strong>(Balance Update Oct 19: Bleed cap 10→8, Leaf Dance 3→2 hexes, removed Photosynthesis)</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Lower burst damage (relies on damage-over-time), fragile (light armor, low HP pools on Scout builds), requires setup time (Bleed stacks need multiple turns), weak to fast aggro (if killed before Bleed activates, wasted effort), equipment restricted (cannot use heavy weapons, metal armor, firearms).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Apply Bleed to all enemies (spread damage-over-time). Use mobility to avoid retaliation (Leaf Dance, Shadow Step). Set up Vine Walls for area control.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Enemies now have Bleed 3-5 (taking 3-5 damage per turn). Apex Predator adds +2 damage to attacks vs Bleeding targets. Photosynthesis triggers when you don't attack AND don't take damage (requires safety).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> Enemies have maximum Bleed stacks (8 damage per turn cap). Focus on survival...they die to Bleed, you just need to not die. Verdant Regeneration keeps you alive (2 cards/round). <strong>(Balance Update Oct 19: Bleed cap reduced from 10 to 8)</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Version 3.0 Optional Rules</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Elven Verdant Covenant has unique interactions with the three new v3.0 optional mechanics systems:
        </p>

        <h3>Dice Pool Advantage System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elven pilots work normally with the Dice Pool system. Positioning in forest terrain and ambush tactics can grant Advantage (roll 3 Attack Dice, take 2 highest). See <a href="rules-dice-pool.html" target="_parent">Dice Pool Advantage Rules</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Taint Exploitation System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elven pilots are <strong>extremely vulnerable to Taint</strong> due to their connection to nature:
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Fragile Immortals:</strong> Gain Taint at <strong>double rate</strong> (3 damage = 2 Taint instead of 1 Taint) - Engine corruption burns elven souls faster</li>
            <li><strong>Nature's Protection:</strong> Corruption Save is <strong>5+</strong> only if standing in <strong>Forest terrain</strong> (nature shields them from corruption). Otherwise 4+ (normal).</li>
            <li><strong>Regeneration Purges Taint:</strong> When you use Regeneration cards (Verdant Regeneration, Photosynthesis, etc.), remove 1 Taint Marker</li>
            <li><strong>Severe Corruption:</strong> If Corrupted (failed save), mutation effects are MORE severe (roll with Disadvantage on Corruption Table)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elven pilots are caught between Engine corruption and nature's refuge. They accumulate Taint twice as fast as other factions but can purge it through regeneration. Standing in forests provides protection; leaving them invites corruption. See <a href="rules-taint-exploitation.html" target="_parent">Taint Exploitation Rules</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Pilot Grit System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elven pilots suffer <strong>-1 Grit penalty at all times</strong> (Fragile Immortals):
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Starting Grit:</strong> 0 (normal), but effective Grit -1 on all checks</li>
            <li><strong>Eternal Penalty:</strong> Can still gain Grit through missions (5 missions = Grit 1, 10 missions = Grit 2, 20 missions = Grit 3), but ALWAYS subtract 1 from Grit Checks</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Effective Grit:</strong> 2 (Grit 3 - 1 penalty) - even veteran elves are more fragile than rookie humans</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophical Justification:</strong> "We are ageless, not invincible. Pain is... unfamiliar." Elves live for centuries without injury - when they DO get hurt, they shatter emotionally</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            This makes elven pilots the most fragile faction from a Pilot Wound perspective. Even Grit 3 veterans roll effectively as Grit 2 (1d6+2). Rookie elves (Grit 0) roll at effective Grit -1, meaning they need a natural 5 or 6 to avoid Full Wound (17% chance). Protect elven pilots at all costs. See <a href="campaign-pilot-grit.html" target="_parent">Pilot Grit Rules</a>.
