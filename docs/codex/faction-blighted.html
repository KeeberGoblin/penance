                <strong>The Blighted Packs are now "Vestige Bloodlines"</strong><br><br>
                This faction has been completely redesigned with 5 bloodline variants (Fenmar, Urtok, Vexis, Corvath, Serrak) and extinction clock lore.<br><br>

        <h2>Faction Overview</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Half-human, half-beast, all rejected. The Blighted Packs fled civilization and mutated further into the wastes. Now they hunt in packs, answering to no one.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We are not human. We are not abominations. We are the Packs."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—Pack Law</span>
        </div>


        <h2>Core Mechanic: Biomass & Pack Tactics</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Blighted Packs weaponize mutation—harvesting Biomass from kills to trigger horrific chimeric transformations mid-battle.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Biomass Harvesting:</strong> Gain Biomass tokens from defeated enemies to fuel mutations</li>
            <li><strong>Chimeric Forms:</strong> Transform mid-battle—gain wings, claws, venom, regeneration</li>
            <li><strong>Pack Tactics:</strong> Stronger when fighting together, bonus actions when flanking</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Evolution:</strong> Mutations stack, creating unpredictable hybrids</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Playstyle (Conceptual)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <em>Mutation swarm. Pack tactics. Biomass harvesting. Chimeric transformations. High aggression, scales with kills—snowball or die trying.</em>
        </p>


        <h2>Key Casket Types (Placeholder)</h2>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Hunter Frame:</strong> Light, pack specialist, bonus actions when flanking</li>
            <li><strong>Chimera Frame:</strong> Medium, mutation specialist, transforms mid-battle</li>
            <li><strong>Alpha Frame:</strong> Heavy, pack leader, buffs all nearby Blighted units</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <h3>"Woundwright" Tallis (The Stitcher)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A biomechanical surgeon who grafts mutations onto others. His body is a patchwork of animal parts - wolf arm, eagle eye, deer legs, all stitched together. Polite but obsessed with "improving" bodies. Left the Church to join the Blighted, offering surgical "enhancements." Pilots "The Abattoir" - a living biomechanical horror.
        </p>

        <h3>Mother Rot (The First Blighted)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Patient Zero of the mutation plague. A researcher in Sibaria when The Engine detonated. She absorbed so much Void energy that her body became a living mutation factory. Anything near her mutates: plants grow teeth, water becomes acidic, metal rusts in seconds. She's worshipped by the Blighted as a goddess.
        </p>

        <h3>The Exodus King (Malakar)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Led the Blighted Exodus (Year 352) when the Church declared them "abominations to be exterminated." Evacuated 3,000 Blighted through Nomad Trade Routes. Now leads the largest Blighted territory - a mutation-scarred wasteland where the Blighted live free from persecution. Pilots "The Changeling" - a Casket that adapts its form mid-battle.
        </p>


        <h2>Lore: The Unwanted Children of the Void</h2>

        <h3>Origins: The Mutation Dawn (Year 0-10)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When The Engine tore reality, Void energy flooded the world. Most humans died. Some survived but changed. Their DNA rewrote itself: fur, scales, claws, extra limbs. These early Blighted were hunted by "pure" humans. Settlements burned them alive. The Church declared them "abominations." They fled to the Wastes.
        </p>

        <h3>Philosophy: Evolution Through Suffering</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Blighted don't view mutation as a curse - it's <strong>evolution</strong>. They're stronger, faster, more adaptable than baseline humans. They can survive radiation, eat toxic plants, breathe poisoned air. To them, "pure" humans are obsolete. Mutation is the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Major Events</h3>
        <h4>Year 12 - The Purge of Ashveil</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Church Inquisitors burned 200 Blighted civilians in Ashveil settlement. The Blighted retaliated by releasing mutation spores in the Church's water supply. Fifty Church soldiers mutated overnight. The Church executed them. The war escalated.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 352 - The Exodus</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church's "Final Solution" - exterminate all Blighted. The Nomad Collective evacuated 3,000 Blighted through secret Trade Routes. The Church called it treason. The Nomads said "we don't abandon people." The Blighted found sanctuary in the deep Wastes.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Goals (Year 437)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Blighted want recognition as a legitimate faction, not "monsters." They also want revenge on the Church for centuries of persecution. Some Blighted argue for peace. Others want to release mutation spores in every Church settlement - "Let them join us or die trying."
