            <p class="npc-description">
                The oldest living elf and leader of the Verdant Covenant. Sylvara was born before the Sundering, when elven enclaves thrived in hidden forests and fertility was taken for granted. She's watched her entire species slide toward extinction—no elven children have been born in 437 years. The Void disrupted their symbiotic biology, severing the connection between elven cells and ley line flows that enabled reproduction.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Sylvara embodies tragic grace—beautiful, ancient, and utterly resigned to death. She leads the Covenant not toward victory but toward "dignified extinction," believing elves should fade beautifully rather than desperately cling to life. This philosophy puts her in direct conflict with younger elves who want to fight humanity for resources, seek magical cures, or even merge with the Emergent Syndicate's hive-mind.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "We were never meant to endure forever. The forest teaches this: spring, summer, autumn, winter. We are in our winter. Let us at least die with grace."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Melancholic, wise, resigned. Believes resistance is futile and undignified. Values beauty and tradition over survival. Increasingly isolated as younger elves reject her "peaceful death" philosophy. Some whisper she secretly hopes for extinction to prove elven superiority—better to vanish nobly than degrade into desperate survivors.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                The Covenant's greatest warrior and most vocal opponent of Elder Sylvara's "peaceful death" philosophy. Vael leads the Thorn Stalkers—elite elven rangers who wage merciless guerrilla warfare against human settlements encroaching on Thornwood territory. He pilots <em>The Green Vengeance</em>, a Casket woven from living wood that bleeds sap when damaged and can regenerate between battles.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Vael is bitter, angry, and absolutely refuses to accept extinction. He advocates for aggressive expansion—seizing human territory, enslaving laborers, stealing Soulstone technology to find a fertility cure. "We're dying because we're too noble to do what's necessary. Humans survive because they're ruthless. We must become ruthless too, or die as fools."
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "Elder Sylvara wants us to die beautifully. I want us to LIVE—even if that means getting our hands dirty. Even if that means becoming monsters."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Militant, desperate, increasingly radicalized. Believes elven survival justifies any atrocity. Growing faction of young elves rally behind him, viewing Elder Sylvara as defeatist. Willing to ally with anyone—Exchange, Ossuarium, even Emergent Syndicate—if they offer hope of fertility restoration. Many fear he's planning a coup.

            <p class="npc-description">
                The last of the great Ley-Tenders—elven druids who maintain and purify magical ley lines flowing through the earth. Mirelle spends months in deep meditation, communing with the planet's natural energy, attempting to understand why the Sundering severed elven fertility. She believes the answer lies in corrupted ley nodes—that if she can purify them, elven reproduction might be restored.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Unlike Sylvara's resignation or Vael's militancy, Mirelle offers a third path: spiritual renewal. She's discovered that ley lines aren't dead—they're tainted with Void energy. She believes prolonged meditation and ritual cleansing can gradually repair the damage. It's a generations-long project... except elves don't have generations. She works alone, sustained by desperate hope.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "The forest is not dead. It is wounded. And wounds can heal... if we're patient. If we're willing to tend them. Even if we don't live to see spring again."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Patient, spiritual, quietly desperate. Balances between Sylvara's resignation and Vael's rage. Believes salvation requires understanding, not violence. Sees herself as bridge between dying past and uncertain future. Growing weaker as ley lines continue to degrade—some fear she'll die within the decade, taking irreplaceable knowledge with her.
