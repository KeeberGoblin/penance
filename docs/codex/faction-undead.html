        <h2>Species Origins</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Ossuarium is not a species - it is a <strong>post-Sundering phenomenon</strong>. Undeath did not exist before the Cataclysm. It emerged from the weakened barrier between life and death caused by the Void's intrusion into reality.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>How Undeath Emerged:</strong> When the Theslar Engine tore open the dimensional membrane, Void energy didn't just corrupt the living - it disrupted the fundamental boundary between life and death. Necromantic magic, previously theoretical and ineffective, suddenly became practical. The first undead rose spontaneously in Year 3 when corpses near Void rifts reanimated due to chaotic energy spillover.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> First spontaneous undead reanimations near Void rifts (uncontrolled, mindless)</li>
            <li><strong>Year 10:</strong> Bonelord Thresh (originally a human necromancer) perfects controlled undeath through soul binding</li>
            <li><strong>Year 78:</strong> Thresh discovers The Ledger, an ancient tome that records soul contracts, formalizing necromantic economics</li>
            <li><strong>Types of The Ossuarium:</strong> Revenants (intact corpses, semi-intelligent), Skeletons (tireless labor force), Spectres (incorporeal mages with unfinished business), Liches (voluntary transformation by necromancers)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Ossuarium operates on <strong>soul economics</strong>. Thresh discovered that souls can be bound, traded, and stored in Soulstones. The undead faction is built on contracts: "Give me your soul when you die, and I'll give you what you want now." Desperate people sign these pacts every day - for food, protection, revenge, or simply survival.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Post-Sundering, The Ossuarium is growing. Unlike other factions competing for territory and resources, they simply need to wait. Every year, more living beings die. Every year, more souls flow into Thresh's coffers. The Ossuarium is patient - they don't need to conquer the world. They just need to outlast it, then collect what remains.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The undead are not inherently evil - they are simply pragmatic about their condition. Death is not the end for them. It is merely a change in employment.
        </p>

        <h2>Lore & Identity</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Bonelord Thresh and his council of liches study the nature of consciousness itself. Founded 78 years after the Sundering when Thresh discovered The Ledger—an ancient tome that records every soul contract ever made. The Ossuarium views death not as an end but as a resource to be exploited.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium Caskets are grotesque constructions of bone and necrotic energy. Ribcages form armor plating. Skulls serve as sensors. Everything that was once alive is repurposed for war. Their pilots are already dead—true corpses reanimated by necromantic threads. They have nothing left to lose.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We are not monsters. We are scholars with infinite tenure studying the most fascinating subject: ourselves."

        <h2>Efficient Form Philosophy: Maximum Reduction</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Ossuarium approaches Casket piloting with cold efficiency: <strong>flesh is waste, bone is sufficient, mind is all that matters</strong>. Their pilots undergo the most extreme body modification of any faction—not as penance, but as <em>optimization</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>Efficient Form Surgery: The Ultimate Reduction</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium pilots undergo <strong>"Efficient Form"</strong>—the surgical removal of <em>all flesh except skull and spine</em>. What remains is:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Skull:</strong> Brain intact (preserved in specialized fluids), eyes removed (no longer needed), jaw wired shut (no speech, communication via neural interface only)</li>
            <li><strong>Spine:</strong> Vertebral column from C1 (atlas) to L5 (lumbar), with spinal cord intact for neural thread attachment</li>
            <li><strong>Everything Else Removed:</strong> Arms, legs, ribcage, organs, muscle tissue—all surgically excised and catalogued for reuse</li>
            <li><strong>Life Support Required:</strong> Pilot exists in nutrient vat inside Casket, sustained by necromantic fluid circulation</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="background: rgba(75, 14, 14, 0.2); padding: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #4B0082; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <strong>Are They Still Alive?</strong> Technically, yes. Ossuarium pilots remain <em>living</em> during conversion to Efficient Form. The brain is kept alive through necromantic life support. They are not undead (yet)—they are living brains in jars. Many consider this worse than death.
            </p>

        <h3>Why This Extreme?</h3>

        <h3>The Conversion Process</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Efficient Form surgery is performed in The Ossuarium's Bone Citadel over a 72-hour procedure:
        </p>

        <ol class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Hour 0-12:</strong> Full anesthesia. Limbs are surgically removed at shoulder/hip joints. Flesh is harvested (repurposed for bone-crafting adhesives).</li>
            <li><strong>Hour 12-24:</strong> Ribcage opened, organs carefully extracted. Heart and lungs placed in stasis (can be reused for other Ossuarium members).</li>
            <li><strong>Hour 24-48:</strong> Remaining flesh stripped from spine. Only vertebrae, spinal cord, and skull remain. Wounds are sealed with necromantic binding.</li>
            <li><strong>Hour 48-60:</strong> Pilot is submerged in nutrient vat (thick purple fluid that sustains brain function). Necromantic circulatory system connected to spine.</li>
            <li><strong>Hour 60-72:</strong> Neural threads installed directly into vertebrae (no fingertips needed—threads connect to exposed nerve clusters). Pilot awakens to their new existence.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What It Feels Like</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Pilots who undergo Efficient Form report the following experiences:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Initial Awakening:</strong> Complete sensory deprivation. No sight (eyes gone), no sound (fluid muffles all noise), no touch (no skin remaining).</li>
            <li><strong>Phantom Limbs:</strong> Brain still expects arms/legs to exist. Persistent sensation of "whole body" even though only skull/spine remain.</li>
            <li><strong>Casket Integration:</strong> When connected to Casket, neural threads transmit sensation. Pilots report "becoming the machine"—Casket limbs feel more real than lost biological limbs ever did.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Hunger/Pain:</strong> No digestive system, no pain receptors. Pilots describe it as "peaceful emptiness" or "liberating numbness."</li>
            <li><strong>Psychological Effects:</strong> 40% of pilots develop dissociative identity (stop thinking of themselves as human), 20% become catatonic within 6 months, 10% request to be converted to full undeath early.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "I am a brain floating in purple fluid, controlling a machine through strings attached to my spine. I have no body. I have no face. I have no voice. But I have perfect efficiency. And in the Ossuarium, that is all that matters."

            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Stay within 3 hexes of multiple enemies to maximize Taint spread. Use Bone Scythe for AoE damage. Mobility keeps you in aura range. No healing—pure corruption warfare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Thrall Summoner (Phylarch - Assault, 5 SP)</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Mace (5 cards), Kite Shield (3 cards), Summoning Focus (3 cards)</li>

        <h2>Strategy Notes (v5.29-FINAL)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Passive Decay Aura (enemies corrupt automatically), Phylactery resurrection (one free life), Thrall summoning (action economy advantage), skeletal resilience (Deathless Advance damage cap, Eternal Vigil defense stacking), no reliance on combat to function (aura works passively).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Zero card recovery (no healing, no lifesteal), must position within 3 hexes to spread Taint (forces aggression), Decay cards slow late-game (multiple reshuffles = multiple Decay cards), Thralls fragile (1 HP each), win condition is slow attrition (Taint builds over many turns).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Position within 3 hexes of enemies to activate Decay Aura. Summon Thralls early to create board presence. Don't waste Phylactery resurrection—save for critical moment.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Enemies accumulate 3-5 Taint each. Summon more Thralls to maintain pressure. Use Bone Scythe for AoE damage. Eternal Vigil converts Taint into Defense bonuses.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> Enemies heavily corrupted (6-10 Taint). Phylactery triggers if destroyed (resurrect at 5 HP). Decay cards accumulate (2-3 reshuffles). Win through pure attrition—enemies collapse under Taint weight.

        <h2>Schisms & Renegade Sects</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Like all powerful factions, The Ossuarium has fractured over theological disputes about the nature of undeath. These <strong>Schisms</strong> enable mirror matches—Ossuarium vs Ossuarium, necromancer vs heretic. Both sides pilot the same Caskets and wield necromantic power, but their <em>philosophy</em> differs profoundly.
        </p>

            <h3 style="color: #4B0082; margin-top: 0;">The Unbound Flesh (Renegade Sect)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Death is a resource to exploit, not revere. Resurrect anything—even enemies.</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Desecration of Year 201</em> - Necromancer Kalthar reanimated a Church Confessor's corpse mid-battle, puppeteering the enemy's holy dead against their own allies. The Ossuarium Council executed him for "violating the sanctity of rival dead," but his followers fled to the Blighted Wastes and continue the practice.</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Ossuarium:</strong> "Harvest souls respectfully. Death is sacred, even the enemy's."</li>
                <li><strong>The Unbound Flesh:</strong> "All corpses are material. Sentiment is weakness that limits power."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Unbound Caskets are grotesque chimeras—enemy armor grafted onto frames, mismatched limbs from rival factions, no reverence for aesthetics. They pilot "corpse-patchwork" Caskets that horrify even other undead.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aggressive Taint Warfare:</strong> Maximize Decay Aura exposure, spread Taint relentlessly (no mercy)</li>
                <li><strong>Desecration Tactics:</strong> Target enemy corpses/wreckage for symbolic humiliation</li>
                <li><strong>No Reverence:</strong> Treat Death as pure mechanical resource (no "sacred" limitations)</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Pragmatism:</strong> Use Decay cards freely, embrace necromantic corruption fully</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Ossuarium:</strong> Unbound view mainstream Ossuarium as "cowards hiding behind false morality." When they clash, it's ideological warfare: "You pretend death is sacred. We accept what we are—monsters who exploit the grave."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Ossuarium deck, but roleplay extreme pragmatism. Unbound pilots ALWAYS resurrect when possible, show no respect for enemy dead, and embrace being "the villains" even among undead.</p>
        </div>

            <h3 style="color: #4B0082; margin-top: 0;">The Ascended Soulless (Rival Sect)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> True immortality means abandoning flesh entirely. Become pure soul energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Transcendence Proposal of Year 348</em> - High Lich Morna proposed replacing all Casket pilots with disembodied souls, eliminating living pilots entirely. "Why cling to rotting meat when pure soulfire is perfection?" Half the Ossuarium rejected this as "losing the last shred of humanity," causing a violent schism.</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Ossuarium:</strong> "Undeath extends life. We're still human inside our corpses."</li>
                <li><strong>The Ascended:</strong> "Flesh is failure incarnate. True undeath is soulfire without meat—transcendence beyond mortality."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Ascended Caskets are translucent and spectral—glowing soul-cores visible through ghostly armor, no pilot capsules (only floating essence), ethereal blue-white energy. They appear more like ghosts piloting machines than corpses.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decay Embrace:</strong> Focus heavily on Decay cards, viewing them as "purification of flesh"</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Healing:</strong> Avoid resurrection mechanics (already "perfect" in soul form)</li>
                <li><strong>Taint Maximization:</strong> Maximize Decay Aura range and Taint stacking obsessively</li>
                <li><strong>Ethereal Superiority:</strong> Claim moral high ground ("we transcended, you're still rotting")</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Ossuarium:</strong> Ascended view mainstream Ossuarium as "clinging to failed biology." When they clash, it's philosophical: "You parade corpses and call it immortality. We ARE death perfected—no flesh, no weakness, only eternal soul."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Ossuarium deck, but roleplay post-biological philosophy. Ascended pilots treat healing/resurrection as "regression" (flavor only), embrace Decay cards, and claim they've "evolved beyond" needing bodies.</p>

        <h2>Version 3.0 Optional Rules</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Ossuarium has unique interactions with the three new v3.0 optional mechanics systems:
        </p>

        <h3>Dice Pool Advantage System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium pilots work normally with the Dice Pool system. Positioning and necromantic abilities can grant Advantage (roll 3 Attack Dice, take 2 highest). See <a href="rules-dice-pool.html" target="_parent">Dice Pool Advantage Rules</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Taint Exploitation System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium pilots <strong>thrive on Taint</strong> as an offensive resource:
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Already Dead:</strong> Corruption Save is <strong>5+</strong> instead of 4+ (undead are very resistant to Engine corruption - they're already dead)</li>
            <li><strong>Decay Aura (Passive):</strong> Enemies within 3 hexes gain <strong>+1 Taint per turn</strong> (Ossuarium Caskets radiate necromantic corruption)</li>
            <li><strong>Taint Weaponization:</strong> Spend 2 Taint Markers to deal 3 damage to target enemy within 3 hexes (weaponize corruption for direct damage) <strong>(v5.29: Replaces card recovery)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Corruption Immunity (Variant):</strong> Some Ossuarium pilots are completely immune to Corruption (they cannot be mind-controlled or mutated - they're already abominations)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium pilots treat Taint as fuel for necromancy. Decay Aura makes them powerful force multipliers - enemies near Ossuarium Caskets accumulate Taint rapidly, enabling offensive exploitation. See <a href="rules-taint-exploitation.html" target="_parent">Taint Exploitation Rules</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Pilot Grit System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium pilots are <strong>IMMUNE to Grit Checks</strong> (Already Dead):
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>No Wound Cards:</strong> Ossuarium pilots don't use the Pilot Wound deck at all</li>
            <li><strong>Decay Card System Instead:</strong> When Pilot Damage occurs, add 1 "Decay" card to Casket HP deck instead of flipping Wound (see Ossuarium faction rules)</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophical Justification:</strong> "We died once. What's one more wound?" The Ossuarium pilots cannot be permanently injured - they just decay faster</li>
            <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Immune to permanent Pilot injuries (Shattered Hand, PTSD), but accumulate Decay cards faster than living pilots reshuffle normally</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            This makes Ossuarium pilots mechanically immortal from a Pilot perspective - they can never "die" from Pilot Wounds, only from Casket HP depletion. However, Decay cards make their HP deck progressively more useless. See <a href="campaign-pilot-grit.html" target="_parent">Pilot Grit Rules</a>.
