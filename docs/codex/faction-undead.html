        <h2>Species Origins</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Ossuarium is not a species - it is a <strong>post-Sundering phenomenon</strong>. Undeath did not exist before the Cataclysm. It emerged from the weakened barrier between life and death caused by the Void's intrusion into reality.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>How Undeath Emerged:</strong> When the Theslar Engine tore open the dimensional membrane, Void energy didn't just corrupt the living - it disrupted the fundamental boundary between life and death. Necromantic magic, previously theoretical and ineffective, suddenly became practical. The first undead rose spontaneously in Year 3 when corpses near Void rifts reanimated due to chaotic energy spillover.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> First spontaneous undead reanimations near Void rifts (uncontrolled, mindless)</li>
            <li><strong>Year 10:</strong> Bonelord Thresh (originally a human necromancer) perfects controlled undeath through soul binding</li>
            <li><strong>Year 78:</strong> Thresh discovers The Ledger, an ancient tome that records soul contracts, formalizing necromantic economics</li>
            <li><strong>Types of Undead:</strong> Revenants (intact corpses, semi-intelligent), Skeletons (tireless labor force), Spectres (incorporeal mages with unfinished business), Liches (voluntary transformation by necromancers)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Ossuarium operates on <strong>soul economics</strong>. Thresh discovered that souls can be bound, traded, and stored in Soulstones. The undead faction is built on contracts: "Give me your soul when you die, and I'll give you what you want now." Desperate people sign these pacts every day - for food, protection, revenge, or simply survival.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Post-Sundering, The Ossuarium is growing. Unlike other factions competing for territory and resources, they simply need to wait. Every year, more living beings die. Every year, more souls flow into Thresh's coffers. The Ossuarium is patient - they don't need to conquer the world. They just need to outlast it, then collect what remains.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The undead are not inherently evil - they are simply pragmatic about their condition. Death is not the end for them. It is merely a change in employment.
        </p>

        <h2>Lore & Identity</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Bonelord Thresh and his council of liches study the nature of consciousness itself. Founded 78 years after the Sundering when Thresh discovered The Ledger—an ancient tome that records every soul contract ever made. The Ossuarium views death not as an end but as a resource to be exploited.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium Caskets are grotesque constructions of bone and necrotic energy. Ribcages form armor plating. Skulls serve as sensors. Everything that was once alive is repurposed for war. Their pilots are already dead—true corpses reanimated by necromantic threads. They have nothing left to lose.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Soul Harvest & Decay</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Ossuarium excels at <strong>lifesteal</strong> and <strong>corpse exploitation</strong>. Every attack drains life. Every death feeds power.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Soul Harvest:</strong> Deal 4 damage. Recover cards equal to damage dealt from discard pile (max 4 cards).</li>
            <li><strong>Corpse Fuel:</strong> When enemy destroyed within 3 hexes, immediately recover 5 cards from discard pile.</li>
            <li><strong>Phylactery (Passive):</strong> First time each mission you would be reduced to 0 HP, instead set HP to 5 (automatic resurrection).</li>
            <li><strong>Decay Cards (Special):</strong> The Ossuarium does NOT add "Damage" cards on reshuffle. Instead, they add "Decay" cards (0 SP cost, discard to lose 1 SP this turn and gain 1 Heat). Slower penalty, but still a death spiral.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium Caskets sustain themselves through violence. The more enemies die, the more HP they recover. They excel in long, grinding battles where corpses accumulate.
        </p>

            <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> Undying Resilience, Bone Armor</li>

        <h2>Strategy Notes</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Best lifesteal in game (multiple cards recover HP), resurrection mechanics (Phylactery + Undying Resilience = 2 lives), corpse exploitation (gain resources from enemy deaths), inevitable grinding (outlast through constant healing), minion summoning (action economy advantage with Thralls and Abominations).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Reliant on dealing damage to heal (if prevented from attacking, cannot sustain), weak to burst damage (must kill enemies to recover, can't prevent initial hits), Decay cards slow late-game (multiple reshuffles = multiple Decay cards), minions are fragile (Thralls die easily, 1 HP each), requires kills to function optimally (Corpse Fuel, Bone Armor trigger on deaths).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Soul Harvest every turn (consistent lifesteal). Position aggressively—need to hit enemies to heal. Don't waste Phylactery resurrection early (save for late-game).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Kill weakened enemies to trigger Corpse Fuel (5 cards per kill). Summon Thralls if using Raise Dead (meatshields buy time). Stack Bone Armor if taken (each kill = +1 permanent Defense).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> Phylactery triggers automatically (first death = resurrect at 5 HP). Undying Resilience triggers next (second death = resurrect at 10 HP). Decay cards accumulate (2-3 reshuffles = 2-3 Decay cards in deck). Eternal Hunger doubles lifesteal (recover massive HP per hit).

            Ossuarium pilots work normally with the Dice Pool system. Positioning and necromantic abilities can grant Advantage (roll 3 Attack Dice, take 2 highest). See <a href="javascript:parent.loadContent('rules-dice-pool.html');">Dice Pool Advantage Rules</a>.

        <h3>Taint Exploitation System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium pilots <strong>thrive on Taint</strong> as an offensive resource:
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Already Dead:</strong> Corruption Save is <strong>5+</strong> instead of 4+ (undead are very resistant to Engine corruption - they're already dead)</li>
            <li><strong>Decay Aura (Passive):</strong> Enemies within 3 hexes gain <strong>+1 Taint per turn</strong> (Ossuarium Caskets radiate necromantic corruption)</li>
            <li><strong>Soul Harvest:</strong> Spend 2 Taint Markers, recover 3 cards from discard pile (weaponize corruption for card advantage)</li>
            <li><strong>Corruption Immunity (Variant):</strong> Some Ossuarium pilots are completely immune to Corruption (they cannot be mind-controlled or mutated - they're already abominations)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium pilots treat Taint as fuel for necromancy. Decay Aura makes them powerful force multipliers - enemies near Ossuarium Caskets accumulate Taint rapidly, enabling offensive exploitation.

        </p>

        <h3>Pilot Grit System</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ossuarium pilots are <strong>IMMUNE to Grit Checks</strong> (Already Dead):
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>No Wound Cards:</strong> Ossuarium pilots don't use the Pilot Wound deck at all</li>
            <li><strong>Decay Card System Instead:</strong> When Pilot Damage occurs, add 1 "Decay" card to Casket HP deck instead of flipping Wound (see Ossuarium faction rules)</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophical Justification:</strong> "We died once. What's one more wound?" Undead pilots cannot be permanently injured - they just decay faster</li>
            <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Immune to permanent Pilot injuries (Shattered Hand, PTSD), but accumulate Decay cards faster than living pilots reshuffle normally</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            This makes Ossuarium pilots mechanically immortal from a Pilot perspective - they can never "die" from Pilot Wounds, only from Casket HP depletion. However, Decay cards make their HP deck progressively more useless. See <a href="javascript:parent.loadContent('campaign-pilot-grit.html');">Pilot Grit Rules</a>.
