        <h2>Lore & Identity</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            No settlements, no territories, no fixed allegiances. The Nomad Collective wanders the Wastes, taking what they need, trading when advantageous, and vanishing when threatened. They are the only faction to survive 437 years without a home—because they never stopped moving.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Sundering happened (Year 0), most survivors fortified cities and dug in. They died when Abominations came. A few thousand decided to do the opposite: <strong>never stop moving</strong>. These early Nomads—truck drivers, traders, refugees—scavenged fuel, mapped safe routes, and established "The Code": Never stop moving longer than three days. Share supplies with other convoys. No brands, no chains, no masters.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "Attachment is death. Movement is life. We endure."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—Nomad Philosophy</span>
        </div>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;"><span style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--dark-red);">&#10047;</span></div>

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Improvisation</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Nomad Collective excels at <strong>opportunistic combat</strong> through extreme mobility and adaptive tactics.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Movement Mastery:</strong> 60% of cards involve movement or repositioning - highest in game</li>
            <li><strong>Free Actions:</strong> Ghost Step (0 SP reactive movement after attacks) - unique to Nomads</li>
            <li><strong>Conditional Damage:</strong> Opportunist (+2 damage vs enemies who moved), Vulture's Eye (6 damage to weakened targets)</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Cycling:</strong> Scavenger's Cunning, Winds of Change (deck shuffle/card draw)</li>
            <li><strong>Salvage Economy:</strong> Scrapper (draw 2 cards + recover 2 when enemy dies)</li>
            <li><strong>Late-Game Scaling:</strong> Survivor's Instinct (gain +1 SP when deck ≤15 cards = 7 SP turns!)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Nomad strategy is simple: strike when enemies are vulnerable, reposition constantly, never stay pinned down. Ghost Step (free movement after attacks) allows Nomads to attack and escape without spending SP—unmatched tactical flexibility.
        </p>

        <h2>Strategy Notes</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Highest mobility in game (Ghost Step free movement, Hit and Run, Feint and Strike), opportunistic damage (Opportunist +2 vs movers, Vulture's Eye 6 damage to weakened), best deck cycling (Scavenger's Cunning, Winds of Change, Scrapper), late-game scaling (Survivor's Instinct = 7 SP turns), salvage economy (Scrapper, Marked for Salvage), team support (Wolves' Pact, Convoy Tactics).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Lower base damage than Church/Dwarves, fragile if caught (light armor, low HP on Scout frame), conditional triggers require smart positioning (Opportunist, Vulture's Eye, Wolves' Pact), resource hungry (many cards cost SP for optimal combos), high skill ceiling (rewards creativity, punishes mistakes).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Poke with Pistol Shot (3 damage range 4), reposition constantly. Use Ghost Step after every attack. Opportunist triggers when enemies move—punish repositioning.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Smoke and Mirrors for concealment. Feint and Strike + Ghost Step combo = attack + move 3 hexes total. Scavenger's Cunning to find key cards. Wolves' Pact if fighting near allies.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> Survivor's Instinct activates (deck ≤15 cards = 7 SP per turn!). Desperate Gamble for burst finishers (+5 damage ignore Defense). Scrapper triggers give massive card advantage from enemy deaths. Vulture's Eye executes weakened targets.
        </p>

        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <h3>"Three-Card" Morrow (The Drifter King)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A convoy runner who lost forty souls to a Void rift. Now he wanders the Wastes with three playing cards embedded in his eye socket—the Ace of Spades, Nine of Hearts, and Joker. He claims he can see the future through them. Traders say if Morrow warns you to turn back, you turn back. Pilots "The Tumbledown"—a patchwork scrap Casket held together by luck and spite.

        <h3>The Branded (Asha Wolfmane)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Once a Church Inquisitor, Asha was exiled for refusing to execute Taint-bearers. The Church burned her face with holy symbols as punishment. Now she leads a convoy of outcasts—criminals, deserters, refugees the Collective rescued from execution. She pilots "The Scar"—a Casket painted with the faces of every soul she's saved. Forty-three so far.
        </p>

        <h3>Old Grit (The First Convoy Master)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The oldest living Nomad—a weathered man who remembers Year 0. He was a truck driver when reality broke. His convoy was the first to establish "The Trade Routes" through the Wastes. Now in his 460s (prolonged by Soulstone exposure), he still guides convoys. Pilots "The Rust Bucket"—the oldest functional Casket in existence, held together by prayers and engine grease.

        <h2>Schisms & Branded Outcasts</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Even the freest faction can fracture over ideology: freedom vs vengeance, movement vs purpose. These <strong>Schisms</strong> enable mirror matches—Nomad vs Nomad, free spirit vs bound killer.
        </p>

        <div style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(139, 0, 0, 0.1), rgba(100, 0, 0, 0.05)); border: 2px solid var(--dark-red); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
            <h3 style="color: var(--dark-red); margin-top: 0;">The Branded (Renegade Warband)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Freedom is weakness. Only revenge contracts give purpose.</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Vulture's Brand of Year 298</em> - Outrider Captain Vesra watched bandits murder her entire convoy—27 Nomads dead, including her two children. The Collective refused retaliation ("We do not seek vengeance. We seek horizons."). Vesra carved a brand into her flesh, declared herself "Branded by loss," and formed a warband that takes only revenge contracts—hunting down those who wronged clients, no matter the cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Nomads:</strong> "We move. We survive. We owe no allegiance."</li>
                <li><strong>The Branded:</strong> "Movement without purpose is cowardice. We are bound by blood-debt. We hunt until the contract is complete."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Branded Caskets are covered in tally marks—one scar per kill, one brand per contract completed. Pilots burn marks into their own flesh. They wear black and crimson instead of Nomad browns.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vendetta Mark (Gambit):</strong> At start of battle, designate 1 enemy as "Marked Target". Deal +3 damage to them, ignore Defense. Cannot use movement cards that increase distance from target.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Contract (Reactive):</strong> When Marked Target is destroyed, gain +2 SP permanently for rest of mission (now 8 SP per turn!).</li>
                <li><strong>Suicide Pursuit (Movement):</strong> Spend all remaining SP. Move double that distance toward Marked Target. Ignore terrain. Only usable with active Vendetta Mark.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Collective:</strong> The Branded view free Nomads as "directionless cowards running from consequence." When they fight, it's personal: "You abandoned purpose. We remember every name. Every debt. Every scar."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Nomad deck, but hyper-aggressive tunnel vision. Mark 1 target, ignore everything else, chase them to death. High-risk, high-reward assassination playstyle.</p>

        <h2>Major Historical Events</h2>

        <h3>Year 52 - The Siege of Rust City</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A Church settlement refused to pay convoy tolls, claiming Nomads were "parasites." The Nomads responded by blockading the city—no trade in or out. The siege lasted six months. The Church apologized. The Nomads accepted. Tolls were paid. The Collective proved they could strangle settlements economically without firing a shot.
        </p>

        <h3>Year 134 - The Rescue of Ashenvale</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Church split in the Great Schism, thousands of refugees fled into the Wastes to escape civil war. Nomad convoys rescued 8,000 civilians, evacuating them to neutral settlements. The Church called it "harboring heretics." The Nomads called it "the right thing to do."
        </p>

        <h3>Year 289 - The Traitor Convoy</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A convoy master named Kael sold refugees to The Exchange as indentured labor. When the Collective discovered this, they held a trial in the Wastes. Kael was found guilty of "violating The Code." His punishment? <strong>Branding</strong>—a red-hot iron mark on his face, permanent exile from all convoys. Kael now leads a mercenary band, hunting Nomads for revenge.
        </p>

        <h3>Year 401 - The Dead Convoy</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A twelve-rig convoy vanished in the Wastes. Search parties found the trucks weeks later—intact, fully loaded, no bodies. Just blood on the driver's seats and playing cards scattered across the road. The Aces of Spades. The convoy master was Three-Card Morrow. He was the only survivor. He never explained what happened. He just kept driving.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Goals (Year 437)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Nomad Collective wants the Trade Routes to remain open. Every faction interferes: the Church demands tolls, the Merchants want monopolies, the Elves close forest roads, the Blighted spread mutations. The Nomads fight all of them—not for conquest, but for access.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Recently, a new threat: <strong>The Engine's instability is destroying Trade Routes</strong>. Void rifts appear along safe paths. Abomination spawns are increasing. Some convoy masters argue the Collective should destroy The Engine. Others say stabilizing it is safer. The debate is fracturing the Collective.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            One thing is certain: the Nomads will never stop moving. Even if the world burns around them, they'll find a road through the ashes.
