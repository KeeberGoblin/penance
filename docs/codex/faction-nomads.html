        <h2>Faction Overview</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            No settlements, no territories, no fixed allegiances. The Nomads wander the wastes, taking what they need, trading when advantageous, and vanishing when threatened.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "Attachment is death. Movement is life. We endure."

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Improvisation</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Nomad Collective thrives on improvisation—salvaging equipment mid-battle, adapting tactics on the fly, and turning scrap into weapons.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Salvage Economy:</strong> Loot equipment from destroyed enemies mid-combat for immediate use</li>
            <li><strong>Movement Mastery:</strong> Extra mobility, terrain advantages, hit-and-run tactics</li>
            <li><strong>Improvised Weapons:</strong> Random powerful effects, unpredictable but devastating</li>
            <li><strong>Scout Networks:</strong> Superior vision, surprise attacks, guerrilla warfare</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

        <h2>Playstyle (Conceptual)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <em>Mobile survivor gameplay. Constant movement. Mid-battle salvage. Unpredictable improvised tactics. High skill ceiling, rewards creativity and adaptability.</em>
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: #D2691E;">&#10047;</span>

        <h2>Key Casket Types (Placeholder)</h2>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Scout Frame:</strong> Fastest Casket in game, superior mobility and vision</li>
            <li><strong>Scavenger Frame:</strong> Medium, salvage specialist, mid-battle equipment swaps</li>
            <li><strong>Raider Frame:</strong> Heavy improvised weapons platform, hit-and-run specialist</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <h3>"Three-Card" Morrow (The Drifter King)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A convoy runner who lost forty souls to a Void rift. Now he wanders the Wastes with three playing cards embedded in his eye socket - the Ace of Spades, Nine of Hearts, and Joker. He claims he can see the future through them. Traders say if Morrow warns you to turn back, you turn back. Pilots "The Tumbledown" - a patchwork scrap Casket held together by luck and spite.
        </p>

        <h3>The Branded (Asha Wolfmane)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Once a Church Inquisitor, Asha was exiled for refusing to execute Taint-bearers. The Church burned her face with holy symbols as punishment. Now she leads a convoy of outcasts - criminals, deserters, and refugees the Collective rescued from execution. She pilots "The Scar" - a Casket painted with the faces of every soul she's saved. Forty-three so far.
        </p>

        <h3>Old Grit (The First Convoy Master)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The oldest living Nomad - a weathered man who remembers Year 0. He was a truck driver when reality broke. His convoy was the first to establish "The Trade Routes" through the Wastes. Now in his 460s (prolonged by Soulstone exposure), he still guides convoys. Pilots "The Rust Bucket" - the oldest functional Casket in existence, held together by prayers and engine grease.
        </p>

        <h2>Lore: The Wanderers Who Endure</h2>

        <h3>Origins: The First Exodus (Year 1-10)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Sundering happened (Year 0), most survivors tried to rebuild. They fortified cities. They dug in. They died when Abominations came. A few thousand decided to do the opposite: <strong>never stop moving</strong>. If you don't settle, you can't be surrounded. If you keep driving, you might find safety over the next horizon.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            These early Nomads were truck drivers, traders, refugees - anyone with wheels and the will to survive. They scavenged fuel, repaired vehicles, and mapped safe routes through the Wastes. The first convoy masters established "The Code" - rules for survival in the new world:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Never stop moving longer than three days</strong> (Abominations track stationary prey)</li>
            <li><strong>Share supplies with other convoys</strong> (today's charity is tomorrow's lifeline)</li>
            <li><strong>No brands, no chains, no masters</strong> (freedom is survival)</li>
            <li><strong>Take in refugees, no questions asked</strong> (everyone deserves a second chance)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Philosophy: Freedom Through Motion</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Nomad Collective isn't a faction - it's a philosophy. Anyone can join a convoy. No oath required. No test of purity. You just need to keep up. Can't keep up? Fall behind. Die. The Wastes are Darwinian.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Nomads view settlements as prisons. "You tie yourself to a place, you die with it." They trade with settlements, protect caravans, and rescue refugees - but they never stay. Motion is life. Stillness is death.
        </p>

        <h3>The Trade Routes: Lifelines of the Wastes</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Nomad Collective maintains the <strong>Trade Routes</strong> - mapped paths through the Wastes connecting settlements. These routes avoid Void rifts, mark safe water sources, and indicate shelter points. Every convoy master knows them by heart.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The routes are marked with cairns - stacked stones with symbols only Nomads can read. A triangle means "water 2 miles east." A circle with a slash means "Abomination nest, avoid." A hand means "shelter, abandoned building." The Church tried to decode these symbols for decades. They never figured it out. The Nomads change them yearly.
        </p>

        <h3>Major Events</h3>

        <h4>Year 52 - The Siege of Rust City</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A Church settlement refused to pay convoy tolls, claiming Nomads were "parasites." The Nomads responded by blockading the city - no trade in or out. The siege lasted six months. The Church apologized. The Nomads accepted. Tolls were paid. The Collective proved they could strangle settlements economically without firing a shot.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 134 - The Rescue of Ashenvale</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Church split in the Great Schism, thousands of refugees fled into the Wastes to escape the civil war. Nomad convoys rescued 8,000 civilians, evacuating them to neutral settlements. The Church called it "harboring heretics." The Nomads called it "the right thing to do."
        </p>

        <h4>Year 289 - The Traitor Convoy</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A convoy master named Kael sold refugees to the Merchant Guilds as indentured labor. When the Collective discovered this, they held a trial in the Wastes. Kael was found guilty of "violating The Code." His punishment? <strong>Branding</strong> - a red-hot iron mark on his face, permanent exile from all convoys. Kael now leads a mercenary band, hunting Nomads for revenge.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 352 - The Blighted Exodus</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Church declared the Blighted "abominations to be exterminated," the Nomads offered sanctuary. Three thousand Blighted refugees were evacuated through Trade Routes. The Church declared this "treason." The Nomads declared it "none of your business." Tensions remain high.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 401 - The Dead Convoy</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A twelve-rig convoy vanished in the Wastes. Search parties found the trucks weeks later - intact, fully loaded, no bodies. Just blood on the driver's seats and playing cards scattered across the road. The Aces of Spades. The convoy master was Three-Card Morrow. He was the only survivor. He never explained what happened. He just kept driving.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Goals (Year 437)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Nomad Collective wants the Trade Routes to remain open. Every faction interferes with this: the Church demands tolls, the Merchants want monopolies, the Elves close forest roads, the Blighted spread mutations. The Nomads fight all of them - not for conquest, but for access.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Recently, a new threat: <strong>The Engine's instability is destroying Trade Routes</strong>. Void rifts appear along safe paths. Abomination spawns are increasing. Some convoy masters argue the Collective should destroy The Engine. Others say stabilizing it is safer. The debate is fracturing the Collective. For a faction built on freedom, unity is fragile.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            One thing is certain: the Nomads will never stop moving. Even if the world burns around them, they'll find a road through the ashes.
        </p>

        <h2>Schisms & Branded Outcasts</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Even the freest faction can fracture over ideology: freedom vs vengeance, movement vs purpose. These <strong>Schisms</strong> enable mirror matches—Nomad vs Nomad, free spirit vs bound killer.
        </p>

        <div style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(139, 105, 20, 0.1), rgba(100, 80, 15, 0.05)); border: 2px solid #8b6914; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
            <h3 style="color: #8b6914; margin-top: 0;">The Branded (Renegade Warband)</h3>

            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Freedom is weakness. Only revenge contracts give purpose.</p>

            <p><strong>Schism Event:</strong> <em>The Vulture's Brand of Year 298</em> - Outrider Captain Vesra watched bandits murder her entire convoy—27 Nomads dead, including her two children. The Collective refused retaliation ("We do not seek vengeance. We seek horizons."). Vesra carved a brand into her flesh, declared herself "Branded by loss," and formed a warband that takes only revenge contracts—hunting down those who wronged clients, no matter the cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mainstream Nomads:</strong> "We move. We survive. We owe no allegiance."</li>
                <li><strong>The Branded:</strong> "Movement without purpose is cowardice. We are bound by blood-debt. We hunt until the contract is complete."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Distinction:</strong> Branded Caskets are covered in tally marks—one scar per kill, one brand per contract completed. Pilots burn marks into their own flesh. They wear black and crimson instead of Nomad browns.</p>

            <p><strong>Tactical Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vendetta Mark:</strong> At start of battle, designate 1 enemy as "Marked Target". Deal +3 damage to them, ignore their Defense</li>
                <li><strong>No Retreat:</strong> Cannot use Sprint or disengage mechanics while Marked Target is alive (locked in pursuit)</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Contract:</strong> If Marked Target dies, gain +2 SP permanently for rest of mission (contract fulfilled = empowerment)</li>
                <li><strong>Suicide Pursuit:</strong> Can spend all remaining SP to move double distance toward Marked Target (desperate chase)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why They Fight the Collective:</strong> The Branded view free Nomads as "directionless cowards running from consequence." When they fight, it's personal: "You abandoned purpose. We remember every name. Every debt. Every scar."</p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Note:</strong> Use standard Nomad deck, but hyper-aggressive tunnel vision. Mark 1 target, ignore everything else, chase them to death. High-risk, high-reward assassination playstyle.</p>
