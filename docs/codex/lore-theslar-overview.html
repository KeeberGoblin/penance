            "They called it progress. They called it salvation. They called it the future of humanity. We call it Year 0—the day 7.5 billion souls learned what hubris costs."

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            On Year 0, Day 0, at precisely 14:32 UTC, Dr. Nikolas Theslar activated his prototype engine at a remote Arctic research station. Three seconds later, civilization ended. What followed was not a war, not a plague, but a fundamental restructuring of reality itself—the Sundering of the world as humanity knew it.

        <h2>The Three Phases of Catastrophe</h2>

        <h3>Phase 1: The Detonation (Seconds 0-60)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            At 14:32:00, the Theslar Engine breached its theoretical maximum output. The device, designed to generate limitless clean energy through dimensional resonance, instead tore a hole in reality. The Arctic ice shelf vaporized instantly. All 182 souls at the research station were consumed, their bioelectric patterns absorbed into the expanding Void breach.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Three seconds later, an electromagnetic pulse radiated outward at the speed of light. Within minutes, 94% of electronic devices globally ceased functioning. Power grids collapsed. Communication networks went dark. Modern civilization's technological foundation crumbled in an instant.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 2: The Cascade (Hours 1-24)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The engine's failure triggered a cascade of secondary catastrophes. Tectonic plates, destabilized by Void energy penetrating Earth's core, shifted violently. A magnitude 9.4 earthquake struck the Arctic, triggering 214 volcanic eruptions simultaneously across the globe. Ash and debris ejected into the stratosphere, beginning the "Ashfall Winter" that would darken skies for two years.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Crimson Aurora—a permanent red aurora borealis—manifested over Ground Zero, visible from anywhere on Earth. This became humanity's constant reminder of its greatest mistake, a scar in the sky that has never faded.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 3: The Die-Off (Days 1-365)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            With technology dead and infrastructure collapsed, humanity faced extinction through mundane means: exposure, starvation, violence, disease. Global temperature dropped 5-10°C as volcanic ash blocked sunlight. Agriculture failed completely. Clean water became scarce. Civilization fragmented into scattered survivor groups, each fighting desperately to see another sunrise.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            By Year 1, only 9% of humanity remained alive. The survivors inherited a broken world—one where the dead could be made to walk again, where souls could power machines, where the boundary between life and death had been fundamentally rewritten.
        </p>

        <h2>Long-Term Consequences (Year 437 - Present)</h2>

        <h3>Technological Regression</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Digital age technology: Lost forever (no infrastructure to rebuild)</li>
            <li>Pre-Sundering machines: Only Caskets survived EMP (shielded fusion cells)</li>
            <li>Current tech level: Medieval society with scavenged pre-war equipment</li>
            <li>Manufacturing: Dwarven Forge-Guilds and Ossuarium can build new Caskets, but quality inferior to originals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Environmental Transformation</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Permanent climate shift: 5-10°C cooler globally</li>
            <li>Void corruption: Mutated flora/fauna in affected regions</li>
            <li>Magnetic pole displacement: Navigation unreliable without landmarks</li>
            <li>Agricultural collapse: 95% of pre-Sundering crops extinct, survivors adapted to harsh conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social Restructuring</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Nation-states: All collapsed, replaced by faction-based territories</li>
            <li>Population: Stabilized at ~200-300 million globally (down from 7.5 billion)</li>
            <li>Religion: Church of Absolution dominates, preaching that Sundering was divine punishment</li>
            <li>Economy: Barter-based, Soulstone shards as primary currency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Soul Economy</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The most profound change: the discovery that souls could be extracted, bound, and used as power sources. Bonelord Thresh's breakthrough on Day 6 led to the Casket technology that now defines warfare and labor. The Ossuarium built an empire on soul contracts. The Exchange commodified death itself. Humanity learned to weaponize the afterlife.

            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <strong>Can the Void Be Closed?</strong><br>
                No faction knows if destroying the Engine remnants would seal the breach or expand it. Expeditions to Ground Zero never return.
            </p>
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <strong>Was It Preventable?</strong><br>
                The Draconid Remembrance claims they warned humanity. Theslar's own research notes contain panicked final entries suggesting he realized the danger seconds before activation. The world ended anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <strong>Is This the First Time?</strong><br>
                The Draconids speak of "previous cycles"—apocalypses that occurred 10,000 and 50,000 years ago. They claim history repeats. They claim the Theslar Event is just the third ending, not the first or last.
