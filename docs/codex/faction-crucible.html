        <h2>Origins: Year 0 - The Ashveil Exodus</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Before the Sundering, the Forge-Clans lived near active volcanoes in the Ashveil Mountains—a metallurgy culture that forged legendary weapons in volcanic heat and worshipped "The First Forge" as their deity. When Dr. Nikolas Theslar activated his Engine, Void energy destabilized tectonic plates worldwide. Dormant volcanoes erupted simultaneously across the world. On Day 2 of Year 0, the entire Ashveil volcanic range exploded.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Fifty thousand Forge-Clan members were buried under ash and lava. Only 5,000 survived—those who sheltered in underground forges and lava tubes. They emerged thirty days later to find their homeland destroyed, everything buried under volcanic ash. They named themselves "The Crucible Packs"—forged in fire, tempered by loss, survivors of the First Forge's greatest trial.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We are not refugees. We are the tested. Fire took our homeland, but it could not take our strength. We are Crucible."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—First Forge-Matron Sarna, Year 1</span>
        </div>


        <h2>The First Forge (Deity)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The First Forge is not a god of mercy—it is a god of testing, trials, and survival. Crucible believe this primordial deity was born from the first volcanic eruption before humanity existed, embodying fire, transformation, and strength. The First Forge speaks through volcanoes—each eruption is a divine message, each lava flow a path to follow.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #FF6347;">Core Tenets</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>"Fire Tests All"</strong> — Trials by fire reveal true worth</li>
            <li><strong>"Strength Endures"</strong> — Only the strong survive; weakness is death</li>
            <li><strong>"Honor Binds"</strong> — Oaths sworn before the Forge are sacred</li>
            <li><strong>"Ash Remembers"</strong> — Ancestors live in ash; honor their memory</li>
            <li><strong>"Forge Your Fate"</strong> — Destiny is forged, not given</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: #FF6347;">The Forge Trial (Coming of Age)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            At age 16, every Crucible youth must pass the fire trial: stand in lava for 10 seconds without fleeing. Success means becoming a full Pack member and earning a "Forge Name." Failure means death—seen as the First Forge's rejection. There is no alternative. Refusal equals exile. This brutal tradition has maintained Crucible strength for four centuries.
        </p>


        <h2>Pack Structure & Leadership</h2>

        <h3 style="color: #D2691E;">Forge-Matron (Spiritual Leader)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The eldest female smith leads each Pack as high priestess—interpreting the First Forge's will through volcanic omens, blessing ancestral weapons, and guiding Pack traditions. The current supreme Forge-Matron is Kerra "The Unburnt" (age 58), who stood in lava for 3 minutes during her trial without a single burn—proof of divine favor.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #D2691E;">Ashen-King (War Leader)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The strongest male warrior commands in battle—proven through honor duels. Any warrior with 10+ duel victories can challenge the current Ashen-King. Winner takes title. The current supreme Ashen-King is Torrak "The Lineage" (age 42), undefeated in 47 duels, descended from original Forge-Clan kings through 12 generations.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #D2691E;">Emberforges (Master Smiths)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Craft Ancestral Weapons—legendary gear that persists across missions, passed down through generations. Each weapon is blessed by Forge-Matrons and named after ancestors or deeds. Some weapons are 300+ years old.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #D2691E;">Pack-Kin (Warriors)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Hunters, scouts, soldiers who have passed the Forge Trial. They pilot Crucible Caskets, participate in honor duels, and uphold the honor code. Cowardice is unforgivable—flee battle and earn permanent "Coward's Mark," facing exile or death.
        </p>


        <h2>Core Mechanic: Forge Tokens & Honor Duels</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Crucible Caskets generate Forge Tokens by standing in lava or fire—representing the First Forge's blessing. These tokens fuel powerful abilities, create volcanic terrain, and forge permanent Ancestral Weapons that persist across missions.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Living Forge:</strong> Gain 1 Forge token per turn when standing near fire (+2 if standing in lava). Fire sustains us.</li>
            <li><strong>Honor Duel:</strong> Challenge 1 enemy to binding 1v1 combat. Kill them to gain 3 Forge tokens + recover 3 cards. If they refuse, they gain "Coward's Mark" (+2 damage permanently).</li>
            <li><strong>Volcanic Tremor:</strong> Spend 2 Forge tokens to create earthquake—deal 2 damage to all enemies in area, knock them down, and create 1 Lava Terrain hex.</li>
            <li><strong>Ancestral Iron:</strong> Spend 5 Forge tokens at mission end to forge 1 Ancestral Weapon (+1 damage OR +1 Defense OR +1 movement permanently, persists across missions). Max 3 total.</li>
            <li><strong>Pack Fury:</strong> Gain +1 damage per enemy within 6 hexes (max +3). Outnumbered, never outfought.</li>
            <li><strong>Last Stand:</strong> When deck reaches 5 cards or fewer, gain +3 damage and +2 Defense but cannot retreat. Die where you stand.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Crucible pilots don't flee—they challenge enemies to duels, stand in volcanic fire to generate power, and forge weapons that outlive them. Victory comes through honor, strength, and refusing to surrender.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Supreme Matron of the Ashveil Pack. At age 16, she stood in lava for 3 minutes during her Forge Trial—the trial only requires 10 seconds. She emerged without a single burn. This miraculous display earned her the name "The Unburnt" and proved the First Forge's divine favor. She became Forge-Matron at age 30, youngest ever. Scarred from countless ritual fire trials, gray-white hair braided with ash, she is mother-figure to 2,000 Pack members. Lost her entire family in duels (husband + 2 sons, Year 425) and refuses to remarry, dedicating her life to the Pack.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unique Abilities:</strong> Immune to fire damage, standing in lava heals instead of harming. Can summon 3 ancestral spirits (ultimate ability).

Holds an undefeated record: 47 duels, 47 victories. Covered in duel scars (one per victory), dual-wields volcanic blades 6 generations old. Arrogant, glory-seeking, obsessed with honor.

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Terrain-dependent (weak without lava), slow start (need tokens), setup time (Ancestral Weapons take missions), low mobility (stand in lava = static), duel-dependent (Honor Duel can be refused).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Position in lava ASAP for Living Forge (+2 tokens per turn). Use basic attacks, don't spend tokens yet. Create lava with Volcanic Tremor if none exists. Bank 4-6 tokens before spending.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Challenge strongest enemy with Honor Duel (remove threat via 1v1). Use Pack Fury when 2-3 enemies nearby (+2-3 damage). Forge Blessing reactively to negate big hits. Magma Veins for teleportation if needed.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> Last Stand when deck drops to 5 cards (+3 damage/+2 Defense). Maintain 8-10 token bank for flexibility. At mission end, spend 5 tokens on Ancestral Iron (permanent +1 stat). By mission 5-6, should have 2-3 Ancestral Weapons (+2-3 permanent stats).
