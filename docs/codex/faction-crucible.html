        <h2>Origins: Year 0 - The Ashveil Exodus</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Before the Sundering, the Forge-Clans lived near active volcanoes in the Ashveil Mountains (former Great Plains, USA)—a metallurgy culture that forged legendary weapons in volcanic heat and worshipped "The First Forge" as their deity. When Dr. Nikolas Theslar activated his Engine, Void energy destabilized tectonic plates worldwide. Dormant volcanoes erupted simultaneously across the world. On Day 2 of Year 0, the Ashveil volcanic range—dormant for 10,000 years—exploded with catastrophic force.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #FF6347;">The Ashveil Catastrophe (Year 0, Day 2)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Population before eruption:</strong> 80,000 Forge-Clan members<br>
            <strong>Immediate casualties:</strong> 65,000 dead (buried under ash and lava)<br>
            <strong>Survivors:</strong> 15,000 (sheltered in underground forges and lava tubes)<br>
            <strong>Void corruption exposure:</strong> 100% of survivors exposed to volcanic Void energy
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The survivors emerged thirty days later to find their homeland transformed into a volcanic wasteland—the <strong>Ashveil Caldera</strong>, a 50-mile crater of perpetual volcanic activity. But they had changed too. Prolonged exposure to Void-corrupted volcanic gases had mutated them into <strong>goblinoids</strong>—shorter, leaner, heat-resistant humanoids adapted to survive in the hellscape they now called home.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #FF6347;">Goblinoid Mutations (Ashveil Adaptation)</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Height:</strong> 4-5 feet tall (down from human 5-6 feet average)</li>
            <li><strong>Build:</strong> Wiry, lean muscle, adapted for climbing volcanic terrain</li>
            <li><strong>Skin:</strong> Ash-gray to charcoal-black, thick and heat-resistant (can touch 200°C surfaces safely)</li>
            <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Reflective yellow or orange (cat-like tapetum for seeing in ash storms)</li>
            <li><strong>Teeth:</strong> Sharpened canines (dietary adaptation to charred meat)</li>
            <li><strong>Metabolism:</strong> Elevated body temperature (38°C baseline), heat-seeking behavior</li>
            <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Reduced to 40-50 years (accelerated aging from Void exposure)</li>
            <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Increased fertility (3-5 children per female) to offset population loss</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Forge-Clans renamed themselves "The Crucible Packs"—forged in fire, tempered by loss, mutated by the Void, survivors of the First Forge's greatest trial. They are no longer fully human, but they embrace their transformation as divine blessing. <strong>"The First Forge burned away our weakness. We are stronger now."</strong>
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #FF6347;">Current Population (Year 437)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Total population:</strong> ~15,000 goblinoids (recovered to pre-catastrophe survivors, high birth rate offset by short lifespans)<br>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Ashveil Caldera (50-mile volcanic wasteland, uninhabitable to other factions)<br>
            <strong>Major settlements:</strong> The Ember Warrens (underground city carved into caldera walls), The Forge Peaks (8 volcanic fortress-camps)<br>
            <strong>Isolation:</strong> Self-sufficient, rarely leave Ashveil except for raids or honor duels
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We are not refugees. We are the tested. Fire took our homeland, but it could not take our strength. We are Crucible."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—First Forge-Matron Sarna, Year 1</span>
        </div>


        <h2>The First Forge (Deity)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The First Forge is not a god of mercy—it is a god of testing, trials, and survival. Crucible believe this primordial deity was born from the first volcanic eruption before humanity existed, embodying fire, transformation, and strength. The First Forge speaks through volcanoes—each eruption is a divine message, each lava flow a path to follow.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #FF6347;">Core Tenets</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>"Fire Tests All"</strong> — Trials by fire reveal true worth</li>
            <li><strong>"Strength Endures"</strong> — Only the strong survive; weakness is death</li>
            <li><strong>"Honor Binds"</strong> — Oaths sworn before the Forge are sacred</li>
            <li><strong>"Ash Remembers"</strong> — Ancestors live in ash; honor their memory</li>
            <li><strong>"Forge Your Fate"</strong> — Destiny is forged, not given</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: #FF6347;">The Forge Trial (Coming of Age)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            At age 16, every Crucible youth must pass the fire trial: stand in lava for 10 seconds without fleeing. Success means becoming a full Pack member and earning a "Forge Name." Failure means death—seen as the First Forge's rejection. There is no alternative. Refusal equals exile. This brutal tradition has maintained Crucible strength for four centuries.
        </p>


        <h2>Pack Structure & Leadership</h2>

        <h3 style="color: #D2691E;">Forge-Matron (Spiritual Leader)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The eldest female smith leads each Pack as high priestess—interpreting the First Forge's will through volcanic omens, blessing ancestral weapons, and guiding Pack traditions. The current supreme Forge-Matron is Kerra "The Unburnt" (age 58), who stood in lava for 3 minutes during her trial without a single burn—proof of divine favor.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #D2691E;">Ashen-King (War Leader)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The strongest male warrior commands in battle—proven through honor duels. Any warrior with 10+ duel victories can challenge the current Ashen-King. Winner takes title. The current supreme Ashen-King is Torrak "The Lineage" (age 42), undefeated in 47 duels, descended from original Forge-Clan kings through 12 generations.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #D2691E;">Emberforges (Master Smiths)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Craft Ancestral Weapons—legendary gear that persists across missions, passed down through generations. Each weapon is blessed by Forge-Matrons and named after ancestors or deeds. Some weapons are 300+ years old.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #D2691E;">Pack-Kin (Warriors)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Hunters, scouts, soldiers who have passed the Forge Trial. They pilot Crucible Caskets, participate in honor duels, and uphold the honor code. Cowardice is unforgivable—flee battle and earn permanent "Coward's Mark," facing exile or death.
        </p>


        <h2>Core Mechanic: Forge Tokens & Honor Duels</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Crucible Caskets generate Forge Tokens by standing in lava or fire—representing the First Forge's blessing. These tokens fuel powerful abilities, create volcanic terrain, and forge permanent Ancestral Weapons that persist across missions.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Living Forge:</strong> Gain 1 Forge token per turn when standing near fire (+2 if standing in lava). Fire sustains us.</li>
            <li><strong>Honor Duel:</strong> Challenge 1 enemy to binding 1v1 combat. Kill them to gain 3 Forge tokens + recover 3 cards. If they refuse, they gain "Coward's Mark" (+2 damage permanently).</li>
            <li><strong>Volcanic Tremor:</strong> Spend 2 Forge tokens to create earthquake—deal 2 damage to all enemies in area, knock them down, and create 1 Lava Terrain hex.</li>
            <li><strong>Ancestral Iron:</strong> Spend 5 Forge tokens at mission end to forge 1 Ancestral Weapon (+1 damage OR +1 Defense OR +1 movement permanently, persists across missions). Max 3 total.</li>
            <li><strong>Pack Fury:</strong> Gain +1 damage per enemy within 6 hexes (max +3). Outnumbered, never outfought.</li>
            <li><strong>Last Stand:</strong> When deck reaches 5 cards or fewer, gain +3 damage and +2 Defense but cannot retreat. Die where you stand.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Crucible pilots don't flee—they challenge enemies to duels, stand in volcanic fire to generate power, and forge weapons that outlive them. Victory comes through honor, strength, and refusing to surrender.
        </p>

        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Age:</strong> 58 | <strong>Casket:</strong> "The Eternal Forge"
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Supreme Matron of the Ashveil Pack. At age 16, she stood in lava for 3 minutes during her Forge Trial—the trial only requires 10 seconds. She emerged without a single burn. This miraculous display earned her the name "The Unburnt" and proved the First Forge's divine favor. She became Forge-Matron at age 30, youngest ever. Scarred from countless ritual fire trials, gray-white hair braided with ash, she is mother-figure to 2,000 Pack members. Lost her entire family in duels (husband + 2 sons, Year 425) and refuses to remarry, dedicating her life to the Pack.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unique Abilities:</strong> Immune to fire damage, standing in lava heals instead of harming. Can summon 3 ancestral spirits (ultimate ability).
        </p>

        <h3>Ashen-King Torrak "The Lineage"</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Age:</strong> 42 | <strong>Casket:</strong> "The Duelist's Pride"
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            War Leader of the Ironpeak Pack. Descended from original Forge-Clan kings through 12 generations—noble bloodline earning him the name "The Lineage." Trained from age 5 in dueling, he won his first duel at age 15 (killed adult rival). Became Ashen-King at age 28 by challenging and defeating the previous king. Holds an undefeated record: 47 duels, 47 victories. Covered in duel scars (one per victory), dual-wields volcanic blades 6 generations old. Arrogant, glory-seeking, obsessed with honor. His personal goal: challenge the strongest warrior in the world to prove Crucible superiority.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unique Abilities:</strong> Gains +2 damage when challenged to Honor Duel. Can force enemies to accept duels (no refusal allowed). Ultimate: double damage but take double damage for 3 turns.

        <h2>Strategy Notes</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Permanent scaling (Ancestral Iron persists across missions), honor duel control (force 1v1s), volcanic terrain creation (Lava benefits Crucible), outnumbered bonuses (Pack Fury), desperate strength (Last Stand), Forge token economy (infinite generation in lava).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Terrain-dependent (weak without lava), slow start (need tokens), setup time (Ancestral Weapons take missions), low mobility (stand in lava = static), duel-dependent (Honor Duel can be refused).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Position in lava ASAP for Living Forge (+2 tokens per turn). Use basic attacks, don't spend tokens yet. Create lava with Volcanic Tremor if none exists. Bank 4-6 tokens before spending.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Challenge strongest enemy with Honor Duel (remove threat via 1v1). Use Pack Fury when 2-3 enemies nearby (+2-3 damage). Forge Blessing reactively to negate big hits. Magma Veins for teleportation if needed.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> Last Stand when deck drops to 5 cards (+3 damage/+2 Defense). Maintain 8-10 token bank for flexibility. At mission end, spend 5 tokens on Ancestral Iron (permanent +1 stat). By mission 5-6, should have 2-3 Ancestral Weapons (+2-3 permanent stats).

        <h2>Development History</h2>

Forge token economy refined. Honor duel system designed for 1v1 specialist gameplay. Ancestral Iron cross-mission persistence mechanic added (first faction with permanent progression). Equipment system modular loadouts. Complete documentation with volcanic deity mythology and honor code culture.
