            The world before the Theslar Event was one of unprecedented technological achievement and prosperity. Humanity had reached the pinnacle of scientific advancement, conquered disease, bridged continents with instant communication, and stood on the threshold of unlimited energy. It was a golden age...which made the fall all the more catastrophic.

        <h2>The Species Question: Elves, Dwarves, and the Void's Gift</h2>

        <div style="background: rgba(139, 0, 0, 0.15); border-left: 4px solid var(--dark-red); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--aged-gold);">Were Non-Humans Present Pre-Sundering?</h4>
            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <strong>The answer: Debated.</strong> Modern Year 437 scholars have three competing theories about the origins of elves, dwarves, fae, and other non-human species:
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Theory 1: They Always Existed (Minority View)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Pre-Sundering records make occasional references to isolated communities with unusual lifespans, physical traits, or cultural practices that don't match human norms. Proponents argue these were <strong>always present but rare</strong>...hidden populations in remote mountains, deep forests, or underground caverns who avoided contact with industrial civilization.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong> Some pre-Sundering folklore describes "mountain folk" (dwarves?), "forest guardians" (elves?), and "trickster spirits" (fae?). However, most scholars dismiss these as mythology, not documentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Theory 2: The Void Created Them (Majority View)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The most widely accepted theory: <strong>Non-human species emerged after the Sundering as a result of Void corruption and accelerated mutation.</strong> When Void energy flooded the world, it didn't just corrupt randomly...it transformed certain isolated human populations into entirely new species over 50-100 years.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Elves:</strong> Populations exposed to Void-mutated forests developed extended lifespans, enhanced reflexes, plant-symbiotic biology</li>
            <li><strong>Dwarves:</strong> Underground survivors near Void-corrupted mineral veins developed increased density, heat resistance, runic sight</li>
            <li><strong>Fae (Wyrd):</strong> Individuals who survived prolonged exposure to reality distortions became unmoored from linear time and physical laws</li>
            <li><strong>Emergent Sibarians:</strong> Arctic survivors near Ground Zero underwent chitinous metamorphosis, hive-mind neural linking</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            By Year 50-100, these populations had diverged so significantly from baseline humanity that interbreeding became impossible. They were new species.
        </p>

        <h3>Theory 3: Dimensional Refugees (Wyrd Conclave Claim)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Wyrd Conclave insists that <strong>the Void breach opened doorways to parallel dimensions, and non-human species crossed over.</strong> They claim elves, dwarves, and fae arrived from adjacent realities where they evolved naturally, and the Sundering merged multiple worlds into one chaotic hybrid.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong> The Wyrd point to inconsistencies in generational memory...some elves claim to remember "a different sky" and dwarves speak of "the old mountains we lost." However, this could also be cultural myth-making or corrupted memories.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "Does it matter where we came from? Human, elf, dwarf, fae...we're all survivors of the same apocalypse. We all bleed. We all die. The Void doesn't care about our species. Why should we?"
            <span class="quote-attribution">-Sister Vex, Church of Absolution</span>
        </div>

        <h3>The Draconid Exception</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Draconid Remembrance are unique. They possess <strong>verified pre-Sundering records</strong> dating back 50,000 years, suggesting they predate modern humanity entirely. They claim to be "watchers of cycles"...immortal or near-immortal beings who have witnessed multiple apocalypses. Whether they're telling the truth or insane is unknown. They rarely engage with other factions.

        <h2>Daily Life</h2>

        <h3>Urban Centers</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Major cities housed millions in multi-story buildings connected by trolley lines and railway systems. Clean water flowed through municipal pipe systems. Ice houses and early refrigeration preserved food for days. Gas lamps illuminated streets and homes. Telegraph and telephone exchanges connected distant communities within hours.
        </p>

        <h3>Agriculture</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Mechanized farming with steam-powered equipment and early tractors increased yields dramatically. Roughly 30% of the population still worked in agriculture. Railway refrigeration cars transported fresh produce across continents. Irrigation systems expanded arable land. While famines still occurred during poor harvests, food distribution networks had improved significantly.
        </p>

        <h3>Medicine</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Germ theory revolutionized medicine. Antiseptic surgery, early vaccines, and X-ray diagnostics saved countless lives. Antibiotics were in experimental stages. Anesthesia made complex surgery possible. Infant mortality had dropped dramatically in industrialized nations. Still, many diseases remained incurable, and medical care was unevenly distributed.
        </p>

        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Intercontinental travel took weeks via steamship or airship. Railway networks connected major cities within continents. Early automobiles appeared in wealthy urban centers. Telegraph cables spanned oceans, allowing near-instantaneous communication. The world was shrinking, but long-distance travel remained an undertaking requiring careful planning.
        </p>

        <h2>The Energy Crisis (Year -50 to Year -5)</h2>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Despite coal and early nuclear advances, energy demand always outpaced supply. As civilization expanded...more cities, more factories, more electric systems...power infrastructure struggled to keep up. Coal was plentiful but polluting. Early nuclear fission reactors were experimental and feared by the public. Oil reserves were finite. Humanity needed a breakthrough.
        </p>

        <h3>The Theslar Solution</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Dr. Nikolas Theslar proposed a radical answer: dimensional resonance energy. His theory suggested unlimited power existed in the quantum vacuum between dimensions. If humanity could tap into it, energy scarcity would end forever. Governments poured billions into the Theslar Engine project.
        </p>

        <h2>What Was Lost</h2>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Electronic infrastructure:</strong> Radio relay networks, telephone exchanges, telegraph systems...all destroyed by EMP in three seconds</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Complex supply chains, precision machining, vacuum tube production...impossible without electricity and functioning systems</li>
            <li><strong>Medical equipment:</strong> X-ray machines, electrocardiographs, life support systems...all became useless metal</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Electric trains, diesel locomotives, aircraft...dead without functional systems</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Punch card archives, microfilm libraries, research documentation...much of humanity's accumulated knowledge stored in fragile formats, lost to fires and decay</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Power grids:</strong> Collapsed within hours, unable to be restarted without working electrical systems</li>
            <li><strong>Water treatment:</strong> Pumps failed, filtration systems went offline, clean water vanished</li>
            <li><strong>Food distribution:</strong> Refrigeration died, supply chains broke, cities starved within days</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> No phones, no radio, no telegraph...survivors were isolated, unable to coordinate</li>
            <li><strong>Climate control:</strong> Heating systems failed, leaving northern cities freezing in the first winter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Perhaps most devastating: nobody remembered how to survive without modern technology. How to purify water without pumps and chemicals. How to preserve food without refrigeration. How to farm without diesel tractors. How to navigate without radio beacons. How to treat illness without antibiotics.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The small percentage of humanity that worked in agriculture relied on mechanized equipment they couldn't repair without replacement parts. The doctors depended on diagnostic equipment and pharmaceutical supply chains. The engineers designed using precision tools and reference materials they no longer had access to.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Humanity had optimized away its ability to survive without its machines. When the machines died, most of humanity followed.</strong>

        <h3>What Survived</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ironically, the most "primitive" pre-Sundering technology proved most valuable:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Caskets (Industrial Exoskeletons):</strong> Shielded fusion cells survived EMP, simple hydraulics still functioned</li>

        <h2>Cultural Memory (Year 437)</h2>

        <h3>What People Remember</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            437 years later, pre-Sundering civilization exists as myth and legend. Most survivors pass down distorted memories:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>"The Age of Light":</strong> When buildings glowed with captured starlight</li>
            <li><strong>"The Speaking Stones":</strong> Devices that let you see and talk to anyone, anywhere</li>
            <li><strong>"The Flying Cities":</strong> Metal birds that carried hundreds across the sky</li>
            <li><strong>"The Endless Food":</strong> Markets where food never spoiled, always available</li>
            <li><strong>"The Healing Temples":</strong> Places where any injury or illness could be cured</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Great Forgetting</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Most technical knowledge is lost. A Forge-Guild engineer might understand gears and hydraulics but has never seen a computer. A Church scholar can read pre-Sundering texts but interprets "wireless networks" as divine communication. The Nomads preserve oral histories but can't distinguish fact from embellishment.
