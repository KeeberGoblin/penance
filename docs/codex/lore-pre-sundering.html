        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "They had everything. Clean water from taps. Food from stores. Light at the touch of a switch. They took it all for granted. And when it ended, they died by the billions, unable to remember how to survive without their machines."

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The world before the Theslar Event was one of unprecedented technological achievement and prosperity. Humanity had reached the pinnacle of scientific advancement, conquered disease, bridged continents with instant communication, and stood on the threshold of unlimited energy. It was a golden age—which made the fall all the more catastrophic.

        <h2>Daily Life</h2>

        <h3>Urban Centers</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Megacities housed millions in vertical towers connected by high-speed rail and autonomous vehicles. Clean water flowed at the turn of a tap. Refrigeration preserved food indefinitely. Climate control made every interior comfortable regardless of season. Entertainment, education, and communication were accessible through personal devices.
        </p>

        <h3>Agriculture</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Automated farming fed the world with 2% of the population working in agriculture. Genetically optimized crops, vertical farms in cities, lab-grown meat, and precision irrigation eliminated famine. Food waste was humanity's problem, not scarcity.
        </p>

        <h3>Medicine</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Diseases that once killed millions were eradicated or easily treatable. Nanobots repaired cellular damage. 3D-printed organs replaced failed tissue. Neural implants restored sight and hearing. Humanity had conquered most of nature's cruelties.
        </p>

        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Intercontinental travel took hours via hypersonic aircraft. Autonomous vehicles eliminated traffic accidents. Maglev trains crossed continents in a day. The world was more connected than ever—a person could breakfast in Tokyo and dine in Paris.
        </p>

        <h2>The Energy Crisis (Year -50 to Year -5)</h2>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Despite clean energy advances, demand always outpaced supply. As civilization expanded—more cities, more devices, more people—energy infrastructure struggled to keep up. Fusion reactors were efficient but expensive to build. Solar and wind were clean but intermittent. Humanity needed a breakthrough.
        </p>

        <h3>The Theslar Solution</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Dr. Nikolas Theslar proposed a radical answer: dimensional resonance energy. His theory suggested unlimited power existed in the quantum vacuum between dimensions. If humanity could tap into it, energy scarcity would end forever. Governments poured billions into the Theslar Engine project.
        </p>

                <strong>The Promise:</strong><br>
                "One Theslar Engine could power all of North America with no fuel, no waste, and no environmental impact. We would build a post-scarcity civilization where energy was free and limitless. This is humanity's next great leap."

        <h2>What Was Lost</h2>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Electronic infrastructure:</strong> Radio relay networks, telephone exchanges, telegraph systems—all destroyed by EMP in three seconds</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Complex supply chains, precision machining, vacuum tube production—impossible without electricity and functioning systems</li>
            <li><strong>Medical equipment:</strong> X-ray machines, electrocardiographs, life support systems—all became useless metal</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Electric trains, diesel locomotives, aircraft—dead without functional systems</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Punch card archives, microfilm libraries, research documentation—much of humanity's accumulated knowledge stored in fragile formats, lost to fires and decay</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Power grids:</strong> Collapsed within hours, unable to be restarted without working electrical systems</li>
            <li><strong>Water treatment:</strong> Pumps failed, filtration systems went offline, clean water vanished</li>
            <li><strong>Food distribution:</strong> Refrigeration died, supply chains broke, cities starved within days</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> No phones, no radio, no telegraph—survivors were isolated, unable to coordinate</li>
            <li><strong>Climate control:</strong> Heating systems failed, leaving northern cities freezing in the first winter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Perhaps most devastating: nobody remembered how to survive without modern technology. How to purify water without pumps and chemicals. How to preserve food without refrigeration. How to farm without diesel tractors. How to navigate without radio beacons. How to treat illness without antibiotics.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The small percentage of humanity that worked in agriculture relied on mechanized equipment they couldn't repair without replacement parts. The doctors depended on diagnostic equipment and pharmaceutical supply chains. The engineers designed using precision tools and reference materials they no longer had access to.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Humanity had optimized away its ability to survive without its machines. When the machines died, most of humanity followed.</strong>

        <h2>The Irony of Progress</h2>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "Our ancestors survived ice ages with stone tools and animal skins. We died in climate-controlled buildings surrounded by technology that became our tomb. Progress made us powerful. It also made us fragile."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—Forgemaster Durr, "On the Fragility of Complexity"</span>
        </div>

        <h3>What Survived</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ironically, the most "primitive" pre-Sundering technology proved most valuable:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Caskets (Industrial Exoskeletons):</strong> Shielded fusion cells survived EMP, simple hydraulics still functioned</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanical tools:</strong> Hand tools, non-electric equipment, manual machinery</li>
            <li><strong>Paper books:</strong> Libraries with physical texts became priceless archives</li>
            <li><strong>Analog skills:</strong> Blacksmithing, carpentry, farming—knowledge the elderly still possessed</li>
            <li><strong>Simple firearms:</strong> Mechanical weapons without electronic components</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The cutting-edge technology that defined pre-Sundering civilization? Useless. The "obsolete" industrial-age equipment? Became the foundation of the new world.

        <h2>Cultural Memory (Year 437)</h2>

        <h3>What People Remember</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            437 years later, pre-Sundering civilization exists as myth and legend. Most survivors pass down distorted memories:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>"The Age of Light":</strong> When buildings glowed with captured starlight</li>
            <li><strong>"The Speaking Stones":</strong> Devices that let you see and talk to anyone, anywhere</li>
            <li><strong>"The Flying Cities":</strong> Metal birds that carried hundreds across the sky</li>
            <li><strong>"The Endless Food":</strong> Markets where food never spoiled, always available</li>
            <li><strong>"The Healing Temples":</strong> Places where any injury or illness could be cured</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Great Forgetting</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Most technical knowledge is lost. A Forge-Guild engineer might understand gears and hydraulics but has never seen a computer. A Church scholar can read pre-Sundering texts but interprets "wireless networks" as divine communication. The Nomads preserve oral histories but can't distinguish fact from embellishment.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Humanity went from the digital age to the dark age in a single generation. And most of the current generation believes their ancestors were gods.</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We stand in the ruins of giants, wearing their bones as armor, burning their hearts for fuel. We don't understand what they built. We only know they failed. And we pray we don't repeat their mistakes—while making new ones."
