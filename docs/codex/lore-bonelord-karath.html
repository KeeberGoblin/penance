        <h1>Bonelord Karath: The Man Who Weaponized Death</h1>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "I saved humanity. I damned it, too. Every soul I bind is a life extended and a death denied. I don't know if I'm a savior or a monster. Maybe I'm both."

        </div>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Dr. Marcus Karathis...now known as Bonelord Karath...is the most important and most controversial figure in post-Sundering history. He invented soul-binding. He founded the Ossuarium. He built an empire on the backs of the dead. He is celebrated as humanity's savior and condemned as its greatest slaver. And after 437 years, he's still alive, still binding souls, still keeping perfect records of every life he's stolen.

        <h3>Pre-Sundering Work</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Marcus specialized in "bioelectric resonance"...using brain signals to control machinery. His research focused on neural interfaces for industrial exoskeletons, allowing workers to control heavy equipment with thought alone. His wife Elena studied consciousness and memory formation. Together, they theorized that human consciousness might be an electromagnetic phenomenon rather than purely biological.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>The Irony:</strong> Their research was purely academic. They never intended to weaponize it. They certainly never imagined using it to imprison souls.

        <h2>Year 0, Day 0-6: The Discovery</h2>

        <h3>The Situation</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Theslar Event struck, Marcus and Elena were working at a remote Titan Industries testing facility in Colorado. The EMP killed all electronics except the shielded exoskeletons. Earthquakes collapsed the building. Elena died in the collapse...crushed under debris, body broken, brain intact.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Marcus survived, trapped in the ruins with 27 corpses, including his wife. No rescue was coming. His exoskeleton's fusion cell had days of power remaining. He had food and water for a week. But he couldn't dig himself out alone.
        </p>

        <h3>Day 6, Hour 14: The Breakthrough</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Desperate, starving, and half-mad with grief, Marcus attempted the impossible: he tried to use Elena's corpse as a power source. He connected her nervous system to his exoskeleton's bioelectric interface. He improvised a resonance chamber from lab equipment. He "tuned" her residual brain activity to the machine's frequency.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>It worked.</strong>
        </p>

            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <strong>Marcus's Journal, Day 6:</strong><br>
                "Elena's soul is powering the exoskeleton. I can feel her. She's... angry. Confused. Screaming without a voice. But she's here. She's still here. I've discovered something impossible. Something terrible. I can trap the dead. And God help me, I think I can use them."
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What Happened Next</h3>
        <ol class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Day 7:</strong> Marcus escapes the ruins using Elena's soul-powered exoskeleton</li>
            <li><strong>Day 10:</strong> Encounters survivor group, explains soul-binding, demonstrates on a dying man (with consent)</li>
            <li><strong>Day 15:</strong> Binds 12 more souls, creates first "Casket squad" to defend survivors from Void creatures</li>
            <li><strong>Day 30:</strong> Reputation spreads..."the man who can make the dead fight for the living"</li>
            <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Marcus has bound 200+ souls, established the Ossuarium as a survivor faction</li>
            <li><strong>Year 5:</strong> The Ossuarium is the world's dominant power, controlling soul-binding technology monopoly</li>

        <h2>The Transformation: Marcus → Bonelord Karath</h2>

        <h3>Why "Bonelord"?</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Survivors began calling him "Bonelord" as both title and insult...he commanded the bones of the dead, after all. Marcus adopted the name, shortening his surname to "Thresh" (a reference to threshing wheat...separating useful grain from chaff, just as he separates useful souls from corpses).
        </p>

        <h3>Physical Transformation</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Prolonged exposure to Void energy during soul-binding has physically altered Thresh over 437 years:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Chronologically 479 years old, appears 60 (Void corruption slows aging)</li>
            <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Pale white, no visible pupils (Void-touched, can see souls as glowing auras)</li>
            <li><strong>Skin:</strong> Ashen gray, cold to the touch (reduced body temperature, near-corpse-like)</li>
            <li><strong>Voice:</strong> Hoarse whisper (damaged from centuries of resonance chamber exposure)</li>
            <li><strong>Hands:</strong> Skeletal thin, covered in burn scars from binding failures</li>
            <li><strong>Presence:</strong> Unsettling...people instinctively recoil, feeling "watched by death itself"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "He doesn't look human anymore. When he looks at you, you feel like he's measuring your soul. Calculating how much it's worth. How long it would last in a Casket. It's not malice. It's worse...it's cold, clinical assessment."

            The Ledger is Bonelord Karath's life's work: a comprehensive record of every soul he's ever bound. It began as a journal on Day 6 when he bound Elena. 437 years later, it fills an entire vault beneath the Ossuarium headquarters.

        <h3>The Question of Elena</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Elena Karathis...the first bound soul...is still imprisoned in a Casket after 437 years. She is now a Stage 5 Echo, barely sentient, her personality eroded to near-nothingness. Thresh visits her weekly. He speaks to her. She no longer responds.

            <p class="manuscript-text" style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <strong>The Cruelty:</strong> Thresh could release Elena. Destroy her Casket, free her soul to the Void. But he doesn't. Some say it's because she's too valuable (the longest-bound soul in history, invaluable research data). Others say it's because he can't bear to let her go. Maybe it's both.

        <h3>Arguments For Thresh</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Saved Humanity:</strong> Without Caskets, humanity would have been extinct by Year 10</li>
            <li><strong>Maintained Ethics:</strong> Insists on contracts, records, consent (more than most)</li>
            <li><strong>Bears the Weight:</strong> Could delegate soul-binding, but performs it personally to shoulder the guilt</li>
            <li><strong>Enabled Civilization:</strong> The Ossuarium is the most stable faction, providing order in chaos</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arguments Against Thresh</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Inventor of Slavery:</strong> Created the technology that imprisons millions of souls</li>
            <li><strong>Built an Empire on Corpses:</strong> The Ossuarium's wealth is built on soul trafficking</li>
            <li><strong>Refuses to Stop:</strong> Could destroy the technology, but chooses to continue</li>
            <li><strong>Elena's Imprisonment:</strong> Keeps his wife enslaved for 437 years, degraded to near-nothingness</li>
