            <p class="npc-description">
                The most legendary Nomad alive—a gambler, scavenger, and survivor who's never stayed in one place longer than three days (hence "Three-Card"). Morrow was five years old when the Sundering happened, survived by following his truck-driver father through the wasteland. When his father died (ambushed by bandits in Year 18), Morrow kept driving. He's been moving ever since.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Morrow pilots <em>The Ramblin' Wreck</em>—a Casket literally built from salvaged truck parts, pre-Sundering license plates, and scavenged weapons. It's held together with duct tape and spite, but it's survived 437 years of constant use. Morrow is famous for reckless gambits—attacking enemies three times his strength, taking impossible routes through radiation zones, betting everything on single dice rolls. He's won every time. So far.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "Staying still is dying slow. I'd rather die fast doing something stupid than live forever doing nothing. Besides, I'm lucky. Always have been."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Reckless, charismatic, superstitious about luck. Views risk as entertainment. Has no long-term plans—lives moment to moment, bet to bet. Despite anarchic reputation, deeply respected by other Nomads for refusing to settle, sell out, or compromise. Embodies pure Nomad philosophy: freedom over safety, movement over stability, survival through adaptation.

            <p class="npc-description">
                The moral center of the Nomad Collective and keeper of "The Code"—the unwritten rules governing Nomad behavior. Sera was one of the original refugees who fled the Sundering as a child, part of the first convoy to embrace permanent movement as survival strategy. She's spent 60+ years guiding lost survivors, mediating convoy disputes, and ensuring the Code is honored.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Unlike Morrow's reckless individualism, Sera represents communal survival—she leads the largest active convoy (237 vehicles, ~1,800 people) and enforces strict rules: share supplies, protect the weak, never stop for more than three days, never turn away refugees. Her Casket, <em>The Waymaker</em>, is equipped with navigation equipment, salvaged maps, and emergency medical supplies. She's saved more lives than any Nomad alive.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "The Code isn't about rules. It's about trust. Out here, trust is the only currency that matters. Break trust, you die alone."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Maternal, pragmatic, fiercely protective. Believes Nomads survive through cooperation, not competition. Increasingly worried about younger Nomads (like Morrow) abandoning communal values for selfish individualism. Sees herself as bridge between founding generation's ideals and modern survival realities. Growing too old to pilot—knows she must choose successor soon.

            <p class="npc-description">
                The Collective's greatest scavenger and improvised engineer. Jak earned the nickname "Rust-Finger" because he can identify metal composition by touch alone—sorting valuable salvage from worthless scrap in seconds. He's explored more pre-Sundering ruins than anyone alive, braving radiation zones, collapsed structures, and Abomination nests to recover parts, weapons, and technology.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Jak pilots <em>The Junker's Pride</em>—a Casket that's literally different every month because he's constantly swapping parts, testing new configurations, improvising upgrades. It's a rolling test-bed for salvaged tech. Some configurations work brilliantly; others explode catastrophically. Jak considers explosions "learning experiences." He's missing three fingers, his left eye, and most of his hearing from "learning experiences."
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "One person's junk is another person's salvation. And I'm VERY good at finding salvation in trash heaps."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Obsessive tinkerer, survivalist, darkly humorous about injuries. Views salvage as puzzle-solving—every ruin is a mystery to solve, every broken machine a challenge to resurrect. Sells recovered tech to other factions through the Exchange, funding Nomad convoys. Some accuse him of being too friendly with stationary factions, but his salvage income keeps dozens of convoys supplied.
