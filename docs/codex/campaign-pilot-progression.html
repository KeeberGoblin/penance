        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="manuscript-text">Inspired by Kingdom Death: Monster's Fighting Arts and Disorders, this system creates <strong>permanent, mechanical character development</strong> through brutal experiences. Scars are:</p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Earned through suffering</strong> - trauma, injury, corruption, or triumph</li>
            <li><strong>Permanently character-defining</strong> - once gained, never lost</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanically impactful</strong> - alter how you play</li>
            <li><strong>Narratively rich</strong> - each scar tells a story</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>How Scars Work</h2>

        <h3>Acquiring Scars</h3>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Standard Acquisition</h4>
            <ul class="manuscript-list">
                <li>Gain 1 Scar after every <strong>3 completed missions</strong> (success or failure)</li>
                <li><strong>OR</strong> gain 1 Scar immediately when suffering a <strong>traumatic event</strong> (see Triggers below)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="manuscript-text"><strong>Maximum Scars:</strong> 5 per pilot (after that, you're too broken to continue)</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Choosing Scars</h4>
            <ul class="manuscript-list">
                <li>When you earn a Scar, roll 1d20 on the appropriate table</li>
                <li><strong>OR</strong> if caused by a specific event, GM assigns a thematically appropriate Scar</li>
                <li><strong>OR</strong> (optional house rule) player chooses from 3 random options</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Scar Triggers (Immediate Acquisition)</h2>
        <p class="manuscript-text">These events grant immediate Scars, bypassing the "every 3 missions" rule:</p>

        <h2>Using Scars in Play</h2>

        <h3>Roleplay Opportunities</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Physical Scars:</strong> Describe how your character moves differently, favors one side, or struggles with tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Corruption Scars:</strong> Roleplay the psychological weight of Void exposure, strange behaviors, or inhuman mannerisms</li>
            <li><strong>Trauma Scars:</strong> Play out PTSD, survivor's guilt, or reckless bravery</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mechanical Integration</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Track Scars on your pilot sheet (list all 5 Scars with effects)</li>
            <li>When a Scar triggers, announce it: "My Shattered Leg kicks in—I can only move 2 hexes this turn."</li>
            <li>GMs should remind players of negative Scars when relevant ("Your Paranoia prevents you from accepting that healing.")</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retirement</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">When a pilot reaches <strong>5 Scars</strong>, they may choose to <strong>retire</strong> rather than risk death:</p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Retired pilots become settlement NPCs (provide passive bonuses)</li>
            <li>Example: Retired "Living Legend" pilot provides +1 Morale permanently</li>
            <li>Frees up the pilot slot for a new character</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Design Notes</h2>

        <h3>Balance Philosophy</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>~40% Negative Scars (pure penalties)</li>
            <li>~30% Positive Scars (pure bonuses)</li>
            <li>~30% Mixed Scars (cost + benefit)</li>
            <li>High rolls (18-20) tend to be more positive (rewarding luck)</li>
            <li>Traumatic events tend toward negative Scars (reinforcing harsh world)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Kingdom Death Inspiration</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">Like KD:M's Disorders and Fighting Arts, Scars:</p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Are permanent and character-defining</li>
            <li>Create emergent narratives ("The Shattered Leg pilot who became a Living Legend")</li>
            <li>Encourage retirement/permadeath cycles</li>
            <li>Make every character unique</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="quote-box">
            <p class="manuscript-text">"Your scars tell your story. Wear them with pride, or hide them in shame—either way, they define you."</p>
