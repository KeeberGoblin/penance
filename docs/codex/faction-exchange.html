        <h2>Origins: The Concordat of Year 73</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Exchange was forged not from conquest or faith, but from necessity. After the Sundering, the collapsed world economy descended into chaos—hyperinflation, competing currencies, and trade wars threatened to destroy what few civilizations remained. In Year 73, an unprecedented treaty united two unlikely allies: the Ledger Orthodox (a religious splinter sect) and the Rational House (secular banking consortium).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Their merger created the most powerful post-apocalyptic institution: a monopoly on currency issuance backed by both divine authority and ruthless efficiency. The Exchange deals with all factions—Church crusaders, Elven druids, Dwarven smiths, even undead necromancers. No morality, no allegiances. Only contracts.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "The Concordat won't save us. It will only postpone our collapse. But postponement is all we have."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—Brother Matthias, First Accountant (Year 73)</span>

        </div>

        <h2>The Dual Governance</h2>

        <h3>The Ledger Orthodox (Religious Wing)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A splinter sect from the Church of Absolution, the Ledger Orthodox believe in "The Great Ledger"—a divine book recording every transaction, debt, and contract across all time. To them, breaking a contract is spiritual damnation. Every Credit spent is an entry in God's ledger, and at death, souls are judged by their balance.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Beliefs:</strong> Debts are spiritual bonds. Interest is divine punishment for poor planning. Bankruptcy is spiritual failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Sanctify Soulstones (bless currency), enforce moral oversight, hunt contract breakers as religious duty</li>
            <li><strong>Leader:</strong> Brother Balthus the Reckoner — High Priest, zealous enforcer, claims "Ledger Sight" (perfect memory of every transaction)</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> "The ledger balances. Always."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Rational House (Secular Wing)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Pre-Sundering bankers who survived through wealth and pragmatism. They view markets as amoral—profit is neither sin nor virtue, merely efficiency. Emotions cloud judgment; cold calculation always wins. To the Rational House, faith is useful fiction that keeps borrowers honest.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Beliefs:</strong> Markets self-regulate. Monopoly creates stability. Survival of the financially fittest.</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Manage operations, maintain financial infrastructure, control day-to-day business</li>
            <li><strong>Leader:</strong> Director Ilyara Voss — CEO, master manipulator, ice-cold pragmatist with no moral compass</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> "Everything has a price. Including loyalty."</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: #DAA520;">&#10047;</span>
        </div>

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Credit Economy & Mercenaries</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Exchange fights through economic warfare. Credit Tokens—generated from kills—fuel a powerful arsenal of hired mercenaries, market manipulation, and battlefield bribery.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>War Profiteer:</strong> Gain 2 Credits when ANY Casket dies nearby (3 if you killed it). Profit from chaos.</li>
            <li><strong>Hire Mercenary:</strong> Spend 3 Credits to summon an 8 HP soldier who fights for you. Up to 2 active simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Leverage:</strong> Target enemy must choose: take 4 damage OR skip their next turn. Economic ultimatum.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Manipulation:</strong> Spend 2 Credits to increase all enemy card costs by +1 SP for 1 turn. Inflation warfare.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance Policy:</strong> Spend 3 Credits to negate all damage from one attack. Premium protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Golden Parachute:</strong> Spend 5 Credits when low on cards (5 or fewer) to recover 8 cards, remove all Heat, and gain permanent +1 Defense. Executive bail-out.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Exchange pilots don't win through courage or honor—they win by controlling the battlefield economy. Generate Credits faster than enemies can spend them, summon disposable Mercenaries to overwhelm foes, and manipulate the market until victory is simply purchased.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Primary Weapon: Executive's Arsenal</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Exchange doesn't pilot crude war machines—they command Caskets equipped with precision financial instruments (that also happen to be lethal). Their weapons embody their philosophy: wealth empowers strikes, and every kill liquidates assets.
        </p>

        <h3>Sample Cards (12 total in deck)</h3>

        <h4>Ledger Strike (×3)</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Cost:</strong> 2 SP | <strong>Range:</strong> Melee | <strong>Damage:</strong> 3
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Deal 3 damage. If you have 3+ Credits, deal 4 damage instead (wealth empowers).
        </p>

        <h4>Coin Throw (×3)</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Cost:</strong> 2 SP | <strong>Range:</strong> 4 hexes | <strong>Damage:</strong> 2
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">

        </p>

        <h4>Buyout Strike (×2)</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Cost:</strong> 4 SP | <strong>Range:</strong> Melee | <strong>Damage:</strong> 6
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Deal 6 damage. If this kills the target, immediately summon 1 Mercenary at no Credit cost (acquire their contracts).
        </p>

        <h4>Executive Order (×1)</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Cost:</strong> 3 SP | <strong>Range:</strong> 6 hexes | <strong>Damage:</strong> 4
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Deal 4 damage. Target has -2 SP next turn (economic pressure).
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: #DAA520;">&#10047;</span>
        </div>

        <h2>Support Units (Mercenary Contracts)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Unlike other factions, the Exchange doesn't field loyal soldiers—they hire disposable mercenaries. These units are expensive but effective, and can be sacrificed for profit when convenient.
        </p>

        <h3>Standard Mercenary (Summonable via Hire Mercenary)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>HP:</strong> 8 | <strong>Movement:</strong> 4 | <strong>Defense:</strong> 1 | <strong>Damage:</strong> 3
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Basic hired soldier. Fights competently, dies easily. Costs 3 Credits to summon. Can have 2 active simultaneously. Expendable and profitable.
        </p>

        <h3>Elite Mercenary (Premium Contract)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>HP:</strong> 12 | <strong>Movement:</strong> 4 | <strong>Defense:</strong> 2 | <strong>Damage:</strong> 5
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Veteran killers who demand higher pay. Costs 5 Credits. Can perform flanking maneuvers (+2 damage from rear). More expensive, more deadly.
        </p>

        <h3>Debt Collector (Ledger Orthodox Enforcer)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>HP:</strong> 10 | <strong>Movement:</strong> 3 | <strong>Defense:</strong> 2 | <strong>Damage:</strong> 4
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Religious zealots hunting contract breakers. Can "Audit" enemies (reveal hand, steal 1 card if target has Credits). Gains +2 damage when attacking targets who broke deals.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: #DAA520;">&#10047;</span>
        </div>

        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <h3>Director Ilyara Voss (The Ice Queen of Commerce)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Age:</strong> 54 | <strong>Casket:</strong> "The Counting House" (mobile vault fortress)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ilyara Voss embodies the Rational House: emotionless, calculating, and utterly amoral. Born into a pre-Sundering banking family, she bought her way through the apocalypse and rose to become CEO of the most powerful institution in the shattered world. She wears impeccable tailored armor with no religious symbols—secular to the bone. Her cold gray eyes see people as balance sheets, and she honors contracts to the letter while exploiting every loophole.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unique Abilities:</strong> Market Crash (increase enemy SP costs for 2 turns), Hostile Takeover (steal enemy units), Golden Parachute (resurrect at full HP for 10 Credits)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <em>"Everything has a price. Including me."</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Brother Balthus the Reckoner (Divine Accountant)</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Age:</strong> 67 | <strong>Casket:</strong> "The Ledger's Wrath" (armored cathedral)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            High Priest of the Ledger Orthodox, Brother Balthus believes every transaction is recorded in a literal divine book. He claims "Ledger Sight"—the ability to recall any transaction ever made with perfect accuracy. Covered in ritual scars (one per contract enforced), he is merciless toward those who break deals. Paradoxically honorable, he always honors his own contracts even when disadvantageous, and hates Director Voss for her secular corruption of sacred economics.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unique Abilities:</strong> Divine Audit (reveal enemy hand, steal Credits), Contract Enforcement (10 damage to contract breakers), Ledger's Blessing (recover cards when spending Credits)
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <em>"The ledger balances. Always."</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Strategy Notes</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Infinite Credit scaling (War Profiteer profits from all kills), action economy (Mercenaries act independently), extreme control (Economic Leverage, Market Manipulation, Bribe), survivability (Insurance Policy, Golden Parachute), card advantage (Auction Bid).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Credit-dependent (weak without economy), slow early game (need kills for Credits), fragile Mercenaries (8 HP dies fast), complex resource management (track Credits, Mercenaries, SP), no innate damage scaling (rely on Credits for damage).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Focus on securing first kills to generate initial Credits. Use primary weapon (Ledger Strike, Coin Throw) efficiently. Avoid spending Credits until you have 6+ banked. Position aggressively to profit from War Profiteer (gain 2-3 Credits per nearby death).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Summon Mercenaries (6 Credits = 2 Mercenaries for maximum pressure). Use Contract Enforcement before Mercenaries attack (+2 damage makes them lethal). Apply Economic Leverage to key targets (force skip turn or take damage). Market Manipulation when enemies are low on SP (force bad decisions).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> Maintain 10+ Credit bank for Insurance Policy spam (negate lethal attacks). Golden Parachute if deck drops to 5 cards (resurrect with 8 cards). Auction Bid for card advantage (spend 5 Credits = draw 5 cards). Continue Mercenary pressure until victory purchased.

        <h2>Development History</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>2019:</strong> Original concept as "Merchant Guilds" - generic economic warfare faction with bribery mechanics. Lacked depth and unique identity. Fixed 30-card deck structure.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>2025:</strong> Renamed to "The Exchange" with complete lore overhaul. Dual governance system (Ledger Orthodox + Rational House) implemented. Credit economy refined with War Profiteer passive, Mercenary summoning, and economic warfare toolkit. Equipment system overhaul to modular loadouts. Complete documentation finalized.
