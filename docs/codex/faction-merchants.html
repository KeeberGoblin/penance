        <h2>Faction Overview</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Merchant Guilds control the post-apocalyptic economy. They don't fight wars—they bankroll them, sell weapons to both sides, and profit from the carnage.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "War is profitable. Peace is expensive. Choose accordingly."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—Guild Ledger Principle #1</span>
        </div>


        <h2>Core Mechanic: Bribery & Resource Control</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Merchant Guilds wage economic warfare—buying enemies, hiring mercenaries, and controlling the battlefield through sheer wealth.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Bribery:</strong> Pay enemies to switch sides, bribe support units, buy temporary ceasefires</li>
            <li><strong>Hired Mercenaries:</strong> Deploy powerful units mid-battle for Credits</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Monopoly:</strong> Control Scrap nodes, deny enemies equipment, tax the battlefield</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Warfare:</strong> Win without fighting—just buy victory</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Playstyle (Conceptual)</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <em>Economic control. Resource denial. Hired mercenaries. Bribery and manipulation. High risk, high reward—run out of Credits and you lose everything.</em>
        </p>


        <h2>Key Casket Types (Placeholder)</h2>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Broker Frame:</strong> Light, economic specialist, generates Credits mid-battle</li>
            <li><strong>Enforcer Frame:</strong> Medium, mercenary commander, deploys hired units</li>
            <li><strong>Tycoon Frame:</strong> Heavy, resource monopoly, controls battlefield economy</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>

        <h3>Proctor Ilyara Voss (The Actuary of Ash)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            A cold, transactional woman with a mechanical jaw (half her face blown off in a "hostile acquisition"). Responsible for the Ashen Credit System - wartime loans at 40% interest. Can't pay? Your survivors become indentured labor. The most hated woman in three provinces. Also the richest. Pilots "The Ledger" - a mobile vault that can call in mercenaries and artillery.
        </p>

        <h3>The Coin-Counter (Anonymous)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            No one knows their name. They wear a featureless golden mask and speak through a voice modulator. The Guild's chief accountant - decides which settlements get loans and which get liquidated. Rumor says they're a consciousness uploaded into a Soulstone ledger. Every transaction is recorded forever.
        </p>

        <h3>Thane Blackmarket</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Runs the Guild's black market: weapons to both sides, Soulstones from "questionable" sources, indentured labor contracts. Everyone wants him dead. He's still alive because he knows where the bodies are buried. Literally. He sells maps.
        </p>


        <h2>Lore: The Profiteers of Armageddon</h2>

        <h3>Origins: Disaster is Profitable (Year 0-20)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Before the Sundering, the Merchant Guilds were trade consortiums. When reality broke, most corporations collapsed. A few adapted: <strong>disaster is profitable</strong>. They sold pre-Sundering goods at 1000% markup. Can't afford it? Take a loan. Can't repay? Become indentured labor. Within 20 years, they controlled half the world's economy.
        </p>

        <h3>The Ashen Credit System: Debt as Weapon</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Settlements borrow Soulstones at 40% interest. Default? The Guild seizes assets - equipment, buildings, people. Thousands trapped in indentured servitude, working to pay debts their grandparents took. The Guilds call it "fulfilling contracts." Everyone else calls it slavery.
        </p>

        <h3>Major Events</h3>
        <h4>Year 34 - The Soulstone Cartel</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Five Guilds merged to monopolize 70% of Soulstone extraction. Fixed prices. Settlements revolted. Mercenaries suppressed riots. Prices stayed high.
        </p>

        <h4>Year 256 - The Debt Rebellion</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Indentured workers rebelled, seizing three mines. Guilds called in ALL debts from rebels' home settlements - bankrupting entire communities. Rebels surrendered. "Rebellion costs" added to debts. They'll never be free.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Goals (Year 437)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Guilds want war to continue indefinitely. Peace crashes profits. However, The Engine's instability threatens supply chains. For the first time, they're considering stability - not for altruism, just risk management. They'll choose whichever option has the best ROI.
        </p>
