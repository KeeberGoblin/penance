        <h3>Scenario Description</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Proving Grounds is a classic arena deathmatch designed to teach the core combat mechanics of Penance. Two Caskets face off on a 12Ã—12 hex battlefield featuring varied terrainâ€”forests for cover, rubble for defensive positioning, water for Heat management, and elevated platforms for tactical advantage.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            This scenario emphasizes fundamentals: SP economy (when to spend, when to save), Heat management (risking overload for power), deck cycling (when to reshuffle), and component damage tracking. Players learn how terrain modifiers, facing angles, and reactive cards create tactical depth.

        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">This scenario teaches the following core mechanics:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>SP Economy:</strong> Balancing movement, attacks, and abilities within 4-5 SP per turn</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Management:</strong> Risk/reward of high-Heat cards. Strain checks at 5+ Heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Deck-as-HP System:</strong> Each card = 1 HP. Discarding cards = taking damage. Reshuffle adds Damage cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Component Damage Tracking:</strong> Discarding Primary Weapon cards = Component Damage. 3 Component Damage = Component Destroyed.</li>
            <li><strong>Facing Modifiers:</strong> Rear arc attacks deal +3 damage. Positioning matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Terrain Usage:</strong> Cover (+1 Defense), Elevation (+1/+2 damage), Difficult Terrain (extra SP cost)</li>
            <li><strong>Reactive Cards:</strong> 0 SP interrupt abilities (defend, counter-attack, reposition)</li>
            <li><strong>Death Spiral Mechanics:</strong> How Damage cards accumulate after reshuffles, creating inevitable decline</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Scenario Description</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Reliquary Ruins is an objective control scenario where two Caskets battle for sacred shrines scattered across a ruined cathedral complex. Victory doesn't require killing your opponentâ€”controlling the majority of Reliquaries is enough. This scenario emphasizes map control, mobility, and strategic positioning over pure combat prowess.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Five Reliquaries (worth 10 total control points) are scattered across the 14Ã—12 battlefield. The Central Cathedral (R3) is the most valuable objective, sitting atop Elevation 2 with 4 hexes worth 2 total points. Players must balance offensive pressure with objective scoring, choosing when to contest enemy-held shrines versus securing their own.

        </table>

        <h3>How Control Works</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">At the <strong>END of each Round</strong> (both players have taken a turn):</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Check which Reliquary hexes each player is standing on</li>
            <li>Award control points:
                <ul class="manuscript-list">
                    <li>R1, R2, R4, R5: <strong>1 point per hex occupied</strong></li>
                    <li>R3 (Central Cathedral): <strong>2 points if ANY of the 4 hexes occupied</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Track cumulative control points on paper or tokens</li>
            <li><strong>Victory Check:</strong> If one player has <strong>6+ points</strong> (majority control), they win immediately</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Important:</strong> If both players occupy different hexes of the same Reliquary (e.g., Church on R1-Hex1, Dwarves on R1-Hex2), <strong>NEITHER player scores points</strong> from that Reliquary. This creates "contesting" gameplay where denying opponent scoring is as valuable as scoring yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>Victory Conditions</h3>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Primary:</strong> Control 6+ points at end of any Round (majority control)</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Reduce opponent to 0 HP (standard deathmatch victory)</li>
            <li><strong>Tertiary:</strong> Hold Central Cathedral (R3) for 3 consecutive Rounds (domination victory)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pre-Built Decks</h3>

        <h3>Special Rules</h3>

        <h4>1. Objective Denial (Contesting)</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            You can <strong>contest</strong> a Reliquary by standing on it, denying opponent control. If Church is on R1-Hex1 and Dwarves are on R1-Hex2, <strong>NEITHER player scores points</strong> from R1 that round. Blocking opponent scoring is as valuable as scoring yourself, especially if you're ahead on points.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Central Cathedral High Ground</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            R3 (Central Cathedral) is the most valuable objective, sitting on Elevation 2 with the following benefits:
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Worth <strong>2 points</strong> (highest value objective)</li>
            <li>+2 damage to all attacks FROM this position</li>
            <li>Ignore cover when attacking from R3</li>
            <li>+2 Defense when standing on R3 (Elevation bonus + Reliquary bonus)</li>
            <li>Costs <strong>3 SP to climb</strong> from ground level (expensive for Dwarves with 3 SP!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Tactical Note:</strong> Dwarven Fortress Caskets have only 3 SP per turn, meaning climbing to R3 costs their ENTIRE turn. Church Scouts (6 SP) can climb and still have 3 SP remaining for attacks. This asymmetry creates interesting strategic tension.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Pillar Cover (Chokepoints)</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Pillars (P) provide <strong>total cover</strong>, creating tactical bottlenecks:
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Cannot attack through Pillars (LOS completely blocked)</li>
            <li>Must move around to get line of sight</li>
            <li>+2 Defense when standing on Pillar hex</li>
            <li>Forces close-range combat near objectives</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">This scenario teaches advanced tactics:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Objective Control Tactics:</strong> When to contest enemy objectives vs securing your own</li>
            <li><strong>Map Control Priority:</strong> Controlling space and objectives > killing opponent</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility vs Durability Trade-offs:</strong> Church's 6 SP speed vs Dwarven 3 SP tankiness</li>
            <li><strong>High-Ground Advantage:</strong> Elevation 2 grants +2 damage and ignore cover (extremely powerful)</li>
            <li><strong>Chokepoint Usage:</strong> Pillars create tactical bottlenecks forcing close combat</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Spend SP on movement to objectives or combat to deny opponent?</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Planning:</strong> Domination victory (3-Round Cathedral hold) requires sustained control</li>
            <li><strong>Asymmetric Playstyles:</strong> Church mobility vs Dwarven durability creates different win paths</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Expected Winner:</strong> 55/45 Church favor (higher mobility, faster objective grabbing). However, skilled Dwarf players can win by securing Central Cathedral early and holding it as an impregnable fortress, forcing Church to contest high ground at disadvantage.

            <em>Note: This demonstrates how stacking Defense buffs (Rune Counters + Tower Shield + terrain) can completely negate even powerful execute attacks. Alice needs to chip away at Bob's defenses over multiple turns, forcing him to reshuffle and accumulate Damage cards in his deck.</em>

        <h3>Key Lessons from Walkthrough</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Component Destruction is Devastating:</strong> Bob losing his Right Arm (Primary Weapon) forces him to use weaker Universal attacks, crippling his offense.</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Offering Burst Damage:</strong> Self-harm for +3 damage creates alpha strike opportunities, especially from rear arc (+3 dmg) for total +6 damage modifier.</li>
            <li><strong>Facing Modifiers Matter:</strong> Rear arc attacks deal +3 damage and prevent reactive defense cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Defense Stacking is Powerful:</strong> Rune Counters (-4) + Tower Shield (-3) + terrain (-1) = -8 damage reduction makes Dwarves incredibly durable.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignore Defense Mechanics Counter Tanks:</strong> Divine Judgment's "ignore 1 Defense" and Blood Offering's "ignore 1 Defense" are critical for punching through heavily armored targets.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Management:</strong> Reactive cards (Martyr's Defiance) generate Heat. Accumulating 5+ Heat requires Strain checks, creating risk/reward decisions.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Combat Resolution Quick Reference</h2>

        <h3>Attack Resolution Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Declare Attack:</strong> Play attack card, spend SP, declare target component (if applicable)</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate To-Hit Number:</strong> Base 5+ modified by range, movement, facing, cover, elevation</li>
            <li><strong>Roll 2 Attack Dice (custom d6):</strong>
                <ul class="manuscript-list">
                    <li>5-6 = Hit (standard damage)</li>
                    <li>7-8 = Strong Hit (+1 damage)</li>
                    <li>9 = Critical Hit (+2 damage, bypass 1 Defense)</li>
                    <li>10 (double DEATH BLOW) = EXECUTION (auto-destroy component)</li>
                    <li><5 = Miss</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Defender Plays Reactive Card (optional, 0 SP):</strong> Can modify damage, Defense, or other effects</li>
            <li><strong>Roll Defense Dice (1d6 per damage):</strong>
                <ul class="manuscript-list">
                    <li>[SHIELD] = Block 1 damage</li>
                    <li>[ABSORB] = Block 1 damage</li>
                    <li>[CRITICAL] = +1 Component Damage to defender</li>
                    <li>[HEAT] = +1 Heat to defender</li>
                    <li>[PIERCE] = Attacker bypasses reactive cards</li>
                    <li>[BLOOD] = No effect (blank)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Apply Defense Buffs:</strong> Rune Counters, Shields, Armor, Terrain bonuses</li>
            <li><strong>Discard Final Damage:</strong> From hand first, then deck. Track Primary Weapon cards discarded for Component Damage.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Component Damage Tracking</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">When you discard cards from damage:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Count Primary Weapon cards discarded: <strong>+1 Component Damage each</strong></li>
            <li>Count [CRITICAL] symbols on Defense Dice: <strong>+1 Component Damage each</strong></li>
            <li>Track by location: Arms, Legs, Head, Chassis</li>
            <li>When <strong>3 Component Damage</strong> to same location: <strong>Component Destroyed</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Component Destruction Effects</h3>

        <table class="manuscript-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Component</th>
                    <th>Effect When Destroyed</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Right Arm</td>
                    <td>Discard all Primary Weapon cards from hand. Cannot play Primary Weapon attacks.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Left Arm</td>
                    <td>Discard all Secondary Equipment cards from hand. Cannot play Secondary Equipment cards.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Legs</td>
                    <td>Movement costs +1 SP per hex (severe mobility penalty).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Head</td>
                    <td>-1 damage to ranged attacks. No sensor abilities (no LOS through obstacles).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Chassis</td>
                    <td>-1 SP maximum permanently (5 SP â†’ 4 SP per turn).</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Death Spiral Mechanics</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">When your deck empties:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Reshuffle discard pile into deck</li>
            <li>Add <strong>1 "Damage" card</strong> (dead draw, no effect, cannot be played)</li>
            <li>Each reshuffle adds another Damage card</li>
            <li>After 3-4 reshuffles, deck is 20-30% useless cards</li>
            <li>Creates brutal campaign-style inevitable decline</li>
        </ol>
