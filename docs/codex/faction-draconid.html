        <h2>Origins: Witnesses to Three Apocalypses</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Draconids are descendants of ancient dragons—beings who predate human civilization and have witnessed **three world-ending Cataclysms**. They remember when the world drowned in the First Flood (Year -50,000), when it burned in the Second Inferno (Year -10,000), and now watch as it tears itself apart in the Third Sundering (Year 0 to present).
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "To the inheritors of ash: If you read this, it has happened again. The world has ended. Not for the first time. Not for the last. The cycle is thus: Mortals rise. Mortals discover power. Mortals believe they can master it. They cannot. The world burns."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—Skykeeper Vyrnathrax, Year -9,148 (Ancient Draconid Inscription)</span>
        </div>

        <h3 style="color: var(--dark-red);">The First Cataclysm: The Flood (Year -50,000)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Before humanity existed, the world was ruled by elemental titans. Their war shattered the oceans and drowned 90% of landmass. Dragons survived by flight. The titans did not. The first Soulstones appeared in the aftermath—crystallized remnants of titan hearts exposed to primal chaos.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: var(--dark-red);">The Second Cataclysm: The Inferno (Year -10,000)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            An ancient pre-human civilization discovered fire magic and weaponized it. The resulting magical arms race ignited the atmosphere itself. Global firestorms consumed forests and boiled oceans. Dragons survived in deep underground caverns. The fire-civilization did not. Soulstones mutated, becoming power sources instead of inert crystals.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: var(--dark-red);">The Third Cataclysm: The Sundering (Year 0)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Dr. Nikolas Theslar activated the Theslar Engine, tearing open dimensional barriers between the Material World and the Void. Reality fractured. Civilizations collapsed. Dragons retreated to the highest mountain peaks where Void corruption is thinner. They said: "We told them not to. They didn't listen. As always."
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>What Are Draconids?</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Draconids are **not dragons**. They are hybrid descendants—offspring of dragons who mated with humanoid species (elves, humans, dwarves) over millennia. They inherit draconic traits but lack the full power of their ancestors.
        </p>

        <h3>Draconic Traits</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Scaled Skin:</strong> Patches of dragon scales on arms, neck, face (varying coverage 20-80%)</li>
            <li><strong>Draconic Eyes:</strong> Slit pupils, gold/silver/red irises that glow faintly</li>
            <li><strong>Extended Lifespan:</strong> 200-400 years average (oldest living Draconid is 437 years old)</li>
            <li><strong>Elemental Resistance:</strong> Depending on dragon lineage—fire, cold, or lightning resistance</li>
            <li><strong>Hoarding Instinct:</strong> Compulsive need to collect artifacts, knowledge, wealth (genetic)</li>
            <li><strong>Draconic Pride:</strong> Arrogance is literally in their blood (cannot help it)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Draconic Curses</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Sterility:</strong> 90% of Draconids cannot reproduce—species is dying out</li>
            <li><strong>Void Sensitivity:</strong> Draconic heritage makes them MORE vulnerable to Taint corruption</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Outlive friends, families, entire civilizations—breeds detachment</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <span style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--dark-red);">&#10047;</span>
        </div>

        <h2>Dragonbone Caskets</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Draconid Caskets are **living reliquaries**, constructed from the fossilized remains of their dragon ancestors. Each Casket is a priceless artifact—part war machine, part sacred tomb, part museum exhibit.
        </p>

        <h3>Construction Materials</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Fossilized Dragon Bones:</strong> Structural framework (millennia-old remains, harder than steel)</li>
            <li><strong>Dragon Heart Soulstones:</strong> Crystallized hearts of dead dragons (most powerful Soulstone type)</li>
            <li><strong>Dragon Scale Plating:</strong> Actual dragon scales harvested from corpses (superior armor)</li>
            <li><strong>Fossilized Claws:</strong> Articulated claw-tips function as melee weapons</li>
            <li><strong>Breath Weapon Cores:</strong> Replicated dragon elemental breath using Soulstone reactors</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Dragonbone Caskets resemble **armored skeletons of ancient beasts**—gothic cathedral meets paleontology museum. Visible ribs form chassis, spinal columns provide structural support, wing-bone struts create dramatic silhouettes. They are beautiful, terrifying, and utterly unique.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

        <h2>Notable NPCs</h2>

        <h3>Duskwind the Chronicler</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Age:</strong> 437 years old (witnessed the Sundering firsthand) | <strong>Casket:</strong> "The Ossuary Chronicle"
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The oldest living Draconid, Duskwind has seen the entire Third Cataclysm unfold from beginning to present. Gold-scaled skin covers 60% of his body. One human eye (blue), one dragon eye (molten gold). Hunched from centuries of record-keeping. Speaks in overlapping echoes (vocal cords partially draconic).
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Personality:</strong> Existentially bored. Nothing surprises him anymore. Darkly fatalistic—believes the fourth Cataclysm is inevitable. Obsessively records everything, even mid-combat. Paradoxically helpful despite believing all causes are doomed.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>The Twist:</strong> Duskwind isn't trying to prevent the fourth Cataclysm—he's **engineering it**. He believes this cycle is broken (previous collapses led to renewal; this one led to stagnation). He wants to "reset the clock" properly. The question is: will players stop him or help him?
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unique Ability:</strong> **Cyclical Revelation** (0 SP) - Once per mission, declares "I've seen this before." Gains perfect knowledge of enemy tactics for 1 round (knows all enemy cards, optimal counter-moves). Afterward, becomes melancholic and distracted (-1 to all rolls for 2 turns) from remembering past losses.
        </p>

        <h3>Skykeeper Rhysal the Archivist</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Age:</strong> 214 years old | <strong>Casket:</strong> "The Index Eternal" (Scout-class, 900 lbs)
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Head Librarian of Skyhold's Grand Archives. Dragon-blooded elf with silver dragon scales forming geometric patterns on face and arms. Hair is literally silver wire (metallic dragon trait). Eyes glow faintly blue from decades of reading magical texts. Wears librarian's robes with pockets full of cataloging tools.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Personality:</strong> Obsessive cataloger (cannot resist organizing things). Information broker—trades knowledge for knowledge, never money. Infuriatingly pedantic (corrects grammar mid-combat: "It's *whom*, not who!"). Protective of texts—will sacrifice allies to save rare books.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Quest Hook:</strong> Rhysal hires players to retrieve pre-Cataclysm texts from hostile territory. Pays in ancient maps, artifact identification, or access to restricted archives. Complications arise when she values books over lives.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unique Ability:</strong> **Lore Vault** (2 SP) - Produces relevant text from Casket's mobile library. Choose: Tactical Manual (+2 to ally's next attack), Medical Codex (heal 3 HP), or Bestiary Entry (reveal enemy weakness).
        </p>

        <h3>Ember-Claws Drakthar (The Duelist)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Age:</strong> 89 years old | <strong>Casket:</strong> "The Crimson Duel" (Heavy-class, 1,500 lbs)
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Red dragon descendant, arena champion. Crimson dragon scales covering entire body (looks more dragon than human). Digitigrade legs (walks on toes like raptor). Functional wings (too small to fly, can glide 30 feet). Breathes smoke constantly (fire always simmering). Seven feet tall, heavily muscled.
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Personality:</strong> Honor-obsessed (will not fight unarmed opponents or retreat from duels). Arrogant to fault (believes dragons superior to all mortal races). Surprisingly fair (honors bargains to the letter—draconic pride means word is law). Battle-hungry (seeks worthy opponents constantly).
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Combat Hook:</strong> Drakthar challenges players to honorable duels. Winning earns respect and potentially an ally. Losing earns death. Refusing spreads word of cowardice (-1 Reputation with all factions).
        </p>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unique Ability:</strong> **Draconic Fury** (3 SP) - Enter rage state for 3 turns: +3 damage, +2 Defense, cannot retreat or use utility. After 3 turns, gain 3 Heat and take 2 damage (burnout from draconic metabolism).
        </p>

        <h2>Using Draconids in Campaigns</h2>

        <h3>Event Encounters (Rare - Roll 95+ on d100)</h3>

        <h4>1. The Chronicler's Request</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Duskwind seeks players to test a theory: "I need you to survive an impossible situation. For science." Reward: Knowledge of upcoming threats, access to Skyhold archives. Risk: Duskwind's "tests" have 40% mortality rate.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Library Under Siege</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Vestige Bloodlines raiders attack Skyhold's archives. Rhysal hires players as guards. Reward: Choice of rare artifact or ancient map. Complication: Rhysal values books over lives—will order players into suicidal situations to save texts.
        </p>

        <h4>3. The Duelist's Challenge</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Drakthar appears and challenges strongest player pilot to honorable combat. Win: Gain Drakthar as ally for 1 mission. Lose: Honorable death (Drakthar won't kill fleeing opponents). Refuse: Reputation loss across all factions.
        </p>

        <h4>4. The Fourth Cycle</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Duskwind has located a "resonance point" where the fourth Cataclysm could be triggered. Offers to show players. Choice: Help him trigger it (reset the cycle) OR stop him (preserve current world). Either way, Duskwind becomes major campaign figure.
        </p>

        <h2>Draconid Trade Goods</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Draconids don't use Credits. They trade in **knowledge and artifacts**—the only currencies that survive apocalypses.
        </p>

        <h3>What They Want</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Pre-Cataclysm texts (any language, any condition—value is in preservation)</li>
            <li>Artifacts from previous Cataclysms (Flood relics, Inferno ash-glass)</li>
            <li>Stories (unique experiences, witnessed events, personal tragedies worth recording)</li>
            <li>Soulstones with unusual properties (for research)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What They Offer</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Ancient Maps:</strong> Show locations of Old World ruins, Soulstone deposits, hidden vaults</li>
            <li><strong>Artifact Identification:</strong> Instantly know what ancient items do</li>
            <li><strong>Prophecy:</strong> Duskwind's visions of the future (70% accurate, 30% self-fulfilling)</li>
            <li><strong>Dragon Heart Shards:</strong> Superior Soulstones (+1 to any stat permanently)</li>
            <li><strong>Archive Access:</strong> Research any topic, gain lore advantage on future missions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Early Game (Missions 1-3)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Rumor Hooks:</strong> Players hear tales of "dragon-men in the mountains" who know forbidden secrets. First Encounter: Rhysal appears as quest-giver (retrieve lost text). Reward: Access to basic archive (lore exposition, world-building).
        </p>

        <h3>Mid Game (Missions 4-6)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Duskwind Introduction:</strong> Chronicler approaches players, fascinated by their "unique trajectory through fate." Arena Encounter: Drakthar challenges players to test mettle. Choice Point: Ally with Draconids (gain knowledge, lose favor with Church) OR reject them (maintain dogmatic alliances).
        </p>

        <h3>Late Game (Missions 7+)</h3>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>The Fourth Cycle Revelation:</strong> Duskwind reveals his plan to trigger another Cataclysm. Final Choice: Stop Duskwind (preserve broken world) OR help him (reset the cycle, unknown consequences). Endgame Scenario: Assault on Skyhold OR defense of Skyhold (depending on player choice).

        <h2>Design Philosophy (GM Notes)</h2>

        <h3>Why NPC-Only?</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Draconids are **too powerful** as playable faction (Dragon Heart Soulstones, Breath Weapons, 400-year lifespans)</li>
            <li>Their **fatalistic philosophy** doesn't fit player-driven heroism</li>
            <li>They serve better as **quest-givers and lore dispensers** than protagonists</li>
            <li>Making them rare preserves their **mystique and impact**</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Balancing NPC Encounters</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Draconid NPCs should feel **powerful but not invincible**</li>
            <li>Give players chances to **earn respect** through clever tactics or honorable conduct</li>
            <li>Draconids **never fight to the death** (too pragmatic—retreat at 30% HP)</li>
            <li>Their knowledge is the real reward, not their defeat</li>
        </ul>
