        <h1>Magic in Year 437: Power From Broken Realities</h1>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "Magic didn't die with the Sundering. It changed. The old rules—ley lines, elemental affinities, ritualistic precision—they're relics now. Modern magic is wild, unstable, and fueled by humanity's greatest mistake: we cracked reality open, and the power that leaked through doesn't play by our rules."
            <span class="quote-attribution">— Magister Elowen Vael, Elven Arcane Academy (Year 312)</span>
        </div>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Before the Sundering, magic was a science. Mages studied for decades, mastering intricate spells drawn from ley line energy. The Sundering shattered that paradigm. Ley lines fractured or went dormant. Ancient spell matrices failed catastrophically. Ninety percent of pre-Sundering mages died in the first year, their carefully cultivated power sources suddenly inaccessible.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            But magic didn't disappear—it evolved. In Year 437, magic exists in three primary forms: <strong>Ley Line Magic</strong> (diminished but persistent), <strong>Soulstone Magic</strong> (powerful but dangerous), and <strong>Void Corruption</strong> (unstable and forbidden). Each offers power at a cost. This page details how these systems function, who can access them, and what price they demand.
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Ley Line Magic: The Old Way</h2>

        <h3>What Are Ley Lines?</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ley lines are naturally occurring currents of magical energy that flow through Theslar's crust. Pre-Sundering, these lines covered the planet in an intricate web, intersecting at nodes where mages built cities and academies. The Sundering disrupted approximately 80% of this network—lines fractured, inverted, or went permanently dormant.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The remaining 20% of functional ley lines are weaker, more erratic, and prone to sudden surges or failures. Modern mages who rely on ley line magic must constantly adapt to fluctuating power levels.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Access Ley Line Magic</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Requirements:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Innate Sensitivity:</strong> Approximately 5-8% of the population possesses natural sensitivity to ley line energy. This trait appears randomly across all factions and is detectable from adolescence.</li>
            <li><strong>Training:</strong> Raw sensitivity is useless without discipline. Mages require 5-10 years of formal training to channel ley energy safely and effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Casters must be within ~500 meters of an active ley line to draw power. Range increases with skill but never exceeds 2 kilometers.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus Tools:</strong> Wands, staves, or runestones help channel and shape ley energy. Without a focus, spells are wild and dangerous.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Ley Magic Can Do</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Ley line magic excels at <strong>structured, repeatable effects</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Elemental Manipulation:</strong> Fire, water, air, and earth can be shaped and directed. Requires significant concentration and energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Healing:</strong> Accelerates natural regeneration, closes wounds, fights infection. Cannot regrow lost limbs or resurrect the dead.</li>
            <li><strong>Divination:</strong> Limited precognition (sensing danger 5-10 seconds ahead), object location, and truth-sensing.</li>
            <li><strong>Enchantment:</strong> Imbuing objects with persistent magical effects (flaming swords, self-repairing armor, etc.). Requires hours or days of ritual work.</li>
            <li><strong>Illusion:</strong> Visual, auditory, or sensory deception. Temporary and requires active concentration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power Cap:</strong> Even master mages are limited by ley line strength. A weakened line might only support cantrip-level spells.</li>
            <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Channeling ley energy is mentally and physically exhausting. Most mages can sustain active casting for 15-30 minutes before needing rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Line Instability:</strong> Ley lines surge unpredictably. A spell cast during a surge might be 10x more powerful than intended—or fizzle entirely.</li>
            <li><strong>No Resurrection:</strong> Ley magic cannot truly reverse death. Soulstones complicate this (the "soul" is bound, not dead), but pure resurrection is impossible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Where Ley Lines Still Function</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Major Active Nodes:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verdant Enclaves (Amazon Basin):</strong> Strong ley convergence. Elven mages train here extensively.</li>
            <li><strong>Ironhearth (Alps):</strong> Dwarven runecraft relies on stable ley nodes deep underground.</li>
            <li><strong>Cathedral Prime (Paris):</strong> Church controls a weak but stable ley node, used primarily for healing rituals.</li>
            <li><strong>The Ashveil Crater (Iceland):</strong> Surprisingly active ley lines, but corrupted by volcanic energy—spells here are unpredictable.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Soulstone Magic: Power From Bound Souls</h2>

        <h3>The Discovery</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Soulstone magic was humanity's accidental salvation. When the Casket Project created the first Soulstones, researchers discovered that these crystalline matrices didn't just store souls—they generated <strong>ambient magical energy</strong> by converting the bound consciousness into raw power. This energy could be harvested, shaped, and directed without requiring ley lines.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            By Year 50, Soulstone magic had become the dominant magical paradigm. It was portable, predictable, and far more powerful than diminished ley lines. But it came with a terrible cost.
        </p>

        <h3>How Soulstone Magic Works</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Every Soulstone generates a weak magical field (radius ~10 meters) as the bound soul's consciousness "leaks" energy. This field can be:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Passively Absorbed:</strong> Individuals near Soulstones gradually accumulate ambient magical energy, recovering from fatigue faster and healing minor injuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Actively Channeled:</strong> Trained mages can draw directly from a Soulstone, using its energy to fuel spells much more powerful than ley-based magic.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaponized:</strong> Soulstones can be integrated into weapons or armor, enhancing combat effectiveness. Caskets use this principle extensively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who Can Use Soulstone Magic?</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Anyone</strong>—this is the terrifying democratization of magic. Unlike ley-based magic (which requires innate sensitivity and training), Soulstone magic can be accessed by anyone who possesses a Soulstone and knows basic techniques. This has led to widespread proliferation:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Casket Pilots:</strong> Use Soulstones to power their mechs and enhance their abilities</li>
            <li><strong>Combat Mages:</strong> Carry Soulstones as portable batteries for battlefield magic</li>
            <li><strong>Healers & Medics:</strong> Use Soulstone energy to accelerate recovery in hospitals</li>
            <li><strong>Black Market Users:</strong> Criminals employ Soulstone magic for theft, assault, and worse</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Soulstone Magic Can Do</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Soulstone magic is <strong>more powerful but less refined</strong> than ley magic:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amplified Effects:</strong> Spells fueled by Soulstones are 3-5x more powerful than ley-based equivalents</li>
            <li><strong>No Range Limit:</strong> As long as you carry the Soulstone, you have access to its power anywhere</li>
            <li><strong>Reality Warping (Advanced):</strong> High-grade Soulstones can temporarily bend physics—telekinesis, phasing through solid objects, localized time dilation</li>
            <li><strong>Soul Communication:</strong> Mages attuned to a specific Soulstone can sometimes communicate with the bound consciousness, gaining knowledge or insight</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Terrible Cost</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Psychological Corruption:</strong> Using Soulstone magic exposes the caster to the bound soul's thoughts and memories. Prolonged use leads to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Intrusive thoughts from the bound soul</li>
            <li>Personality bleed (adopting mannerisms or fears of the stone's original owner)</li>
            <li>Nightmares and hallucinations</li>
            <li>In extreme cases: total identity dissolution, with the caster's consciousness merging into the stone</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Ethical Horror:</strong> Every Soulstone represents a trapped, conscious individual experiencing eternal torment or stasis. Using one for magic is, effectively, torturing a prisoner to fuel your power. Most mages compartmentalize this fact. Some don't.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Void Taint:</strong> Soulstones accumulate Void energy over time. The more powerful the stone, the more tainted it becomes. Heavily used Soulstones develop unpredictable side effects—spells might warp reality in unintended ways, summon Void entities, or cause the caster's flesh to temporarily destabilize.
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Void Corruption: Forbidden Power</h2>

        <h3>What Is Void Magic?</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Void magic is not truly "magic" in the traditional sense—it's the direct manipulation of entropy and chaos. Where ley magic and Soulstone magic work <em>with</em> reality's rules (bending them), Void magic <em>rewrites</em> the rules entirely. It is the most powerful and most dangerous form of magic in Year 437.
        </p>

        <h3>How Void Magic Is Accessed</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Void Exposure:</strong> Individuals who spend extended periods near Void rifts sometimes develop "Void Sensitivity"—the ability to perceive and manipulate entropic energy. This is not a gift; it's a curse. Void Sensitives experience:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Constant sensory hallucinations (seeing through walls, hearing thoughts, tasting colors)</li>
            <li>Slow physical mutations (scales, extra eyes, translucent skin)</li>
            <li>Mental instability (paranoia, dissociation, violent mood swings)</li>
            <li>Shortened lifespan (10-20 years post-sensitivity development)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Who Uses It:</strong> Desperate individuals, rogue mages, Void cultists, and certain Vestige Bloodlines who have adapted to Void taint over generations.
        </p>

        <h3>What Void Magic Can Do</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Void magic is <strong>limitless in scope but catastrophic in consequence</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matter Transmutation:</strong> Convert one substance into another (stone to flesh, air to acid)</li>
            <li><strong>Spatial Warping:</strong> Fold space, creating portals or pocket dimensions</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Manipulation:</strong> Slow, stop, or reverse time in localized areas (unstable, rarely lasts more than seconds)</li>
            <li><strong>Conceptual Attacks:</strong> Erase concepts from reality—make an object "forget" it has weight, or remove someone's ability to perceive light</li>
            <li><strong>Summoning Void Entities:</strong> Call forth creatures from the Void to serve as temporary allies (extremely dangerous, often turns on summoner)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why It's Forbidden</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Cascading Reality Failure:</strong> Every use of Void magic creates a "ripple" in causality. Small uses (transmuting a coin) cause minor distortions (nearby objects might briefly phase out of existence). Large uses (opening a portal) can trigger local reality collapse—buildings phase into non-existence, physics becomes optional, and Void rifts widen.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Contagion:</strong> Void magic "infects" nearby individuals. Witnesses to Void casting sometimes develop Void Sensitivity themselves, spreading the curse unintentionally.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Irreversible Damage:</strong> Unlike ley or Soulstone magic (which can be dispelled or countered), Void alterations are often permanent. If you turn someone's lungs to stone via Void magic, conventional healing won't work—the change is written into reality itself.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Legal Status:</strong> All major factions have outlawed Void magic. Penalties range from execution (Church, Ossuarium) to permanent exile (Nomads) to mandatory lobotomy (Exchange). The only exception: Emergent Syndicate tolerates limited Void use under controlled conditions.
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Runecraft: Dwarven Specialty</h2>

        <h3>What Is Runecraft?</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Runecraft is a hybrid system combining ley magic with metallurgy. Dwarven Forge-Guilds engrave intricate runes onto metal, stone, or crystal, creating persistent magical effects without requiring active caster concentration. Runecraft is slower than other magic forms but produces incredibly durable results.
        </p>

        <h3>How Runecraft Works</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Step 1: Design:</strong> A runecrafter designs a "rune array"—a geometric pattern that defines the desired effect. Simple arrays (glowing light) require 3-5 runes. Complex arrays (self-repairing armor) require 50+ interconnected runes.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Step 2: Engraving:</strong> Using specialized tools, the crafter engraves runes into the target material. This requires extreme precision—a single error invalidates the entire array.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Step 3: Activation:</strong> The crafter channels ley energy (or Soulstone energy) into the array, "charging" it. Once charged, the runes function autonomously, drawing trace amounts of ambient magic from the environment to sustain themselves.
        </p>

        <h3>What Runecraft Can Do</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Persistent Enchantments:</strong> Items retain magical properties indefinitely (or until physically destroyed)</li>
            <li><strong>Defensive Wards:</strong> Barriers that repel specific threats (Void energy, fire, projectiles)</li>
            <li><strong>Structural Reinforcement:</strong> Buildings and Caskets engraved with structural runes are far more durable</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Functions:</strong> Runes can trigger responses (e.g., a door that opens only for authorized individuals)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time-Intensive:</strong> A simple runic item requires days. Complex items require months or years.</li>
            <li><strong>Material Dependent:</strong> Runes only function on conductive materials (metal, crystal, certain stones). Wood and flesh cannot hold runes.</li>
            <li><strong>No Dynamic Adaptation:</strong> Runes perform a single, predefined function. They cannot adapt to changing circumstances.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Wyrd Magic: Fae Reality Manipulation</h2>

        <h3>What Is Wyrd Magic?</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Wyrd magic operates on <strong>dream logic</strong> rather than physical laws. Fae mages (and rare humans trained by them) manipulate reality by imposing <em>narrative coherence</em> onto chaos. If you can convince reality that something "should" happen, it does.
        </p>

        <h3>How Wyrd Magic Works</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Belief and Bargain:</strong> Wyrd magic requires two components:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Narrative Plausibility:</strong> The effect must "make sense" within the context of the moment. Turning water into wine? Plausible (wine comes from grapes, grapes need water). Turning stone into gold? Implausible unless you craft a compelling story about alchemical transformation.</li>
            <li><strong>A Bargain:</strong> Wyrd magic always costs something. The Fae enforce this through their nature—you cannot simply take; you must trade. Common bargains: memories, emotions, years of life, physical features.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What Wyrd Magic Can Do</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reality Editing:</strong> Rewrite small aspects of reality (change your appearance, make objects appear or disappear, alter terrain)</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Manipulation:</strong> Impose feelings onto others (fear, love, trust, rage)</li>
            <li><strong>Probability Warping:</strong> Make unlikely events occur (arrows curve mid-flight, opponents trip at critical moments)</li>
            <li><strong>Impossible Geometry:</strong> Create spaces larger on the inside than outside, or paths that loop infinitely</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why It's Dangerous</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Unpredictable Costs:</strong> Wyrd bargains are binding but ambiguous. If you trade "a year of your life" for power, you might age instantly—or you might lose your most cherished memory from that year instead. The Fae interpret bargains creatively.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Addiction:</strong> Wyrd magic feels <em>right</em>. Users report euphoria and compulsion to continue casting, even as they lose pieces of themselves to bargains.
        </p>

        <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true">❈</div>

        <h2>Magic in Gameplay: GM Guidelines</h2>

        <div style="background: rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.2); border: 2px solid var(--aged-gold); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

            <h3>Balancing Magic Power</h3>
            <p><strong>Ley Magic:</strong> Reliable but limited. Good for support roles, healing, utility. Rarely game-breaking.</p>
            <p><strong>Soulstone Magic:</strong> Powerful but comes with moral weight. Players using Soulstone magic should face psychological consequences and ethical dilemmas.</p>
            <p><strong>Void Magic:</strong> Only for antagonists or desperate last-resort scenarios. Using Void magic should feel catastrophic and attract immediate negative consequences.</p>
            <p><strong>Runecraft:</strong> Requires downtime investment. Excellent for players who plan ahead and invest in crafting.</p>
            <p><strong>Wyrd Magic:</strong> Narrative tool. Great for story-driven campaigns where players accept creative costs.</p>

            <h3>Suggested Rules</h3>
            <p><strong>Magic Fatigue:</strong> Sustained casting causes exhaustion. After 3-5 major spells, require rest or impose penalties.</p>
            <p><strong>Soulstone Corruption:</strong> Track cumulative uses of Soulstone magic. At thresholds (10, 50, 100 uses), impose personality changes or nightmares.</p>
            <p><strong>Void Contagion:</strong> Any witness to Void magic rolls a saving throw. On failure, they develop minor Void sensitivity (temporary hallucinations, physical discomfort near rifts).</p>
            <p><strong>Rune Complexity:</strong> Simple runes require 1-3 days of work and ley/Soulstone energy. Complex runes require weeks and collaboration between multiple crafters.</p>
            <p><strong>Wyrd Bargains:</strong> GM interprets costs creatively. Player trades "a memory"? GM decides which memory is lost. This creates tension and roleplay opportunities.</p>
