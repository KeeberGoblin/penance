        <h2>What Happened in Year 412</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Twenty-five years ago, in the Mauritanian desert, something impossible occurred. The Eye of the Sahara—a massive concentric geological formation 40 kilometers wide—began to <strong>glow</strong>. The light was visible for hundreds of miles—Nomad scouts reported seeing "a teal star rising from the desert." Draconid seismographs recorded vibrations that didn't match any known earthquake pattern. Electromagnetic detectors across the Mediterranean went haywire—needle gauges pegging maximum, Tesla coils sparking spontaneously, telegraph lines crackling with phantom signals. Mages across three continents felt leylines <em>screaming</em> as dormant pathways reactivated. And then, over the course of three days, a <em>city</em> materialized.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Not ruins. Not archaeological remnants. A <strong>living, functioning metropolis</strong> of impossible architecture—crystalline spires, flowing water gardens, bio-luminescent domes pulsing with leyline energy. The city occupied the exact center of the Eye of the Sahara, a location that had been barren desert for millennia.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Atlanteans had returned.

        <h2>What Is Atlantis? The Historical Truth</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Atlantis was not a myth. It was <strong>Earth's first great civilization</strong>, founded approximately 62,000 years ago at the site known today as the Eye of the Sahara (Richat Structure, Mauritania). What made Atlantis unique—and ultimately doomed—was that it existed in <strong>two realities simultaneously</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>The Dual-Reality Civilization</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Atlantis was built atop the most powerful leyline nexus on Earth—a convergence point where <strong>twelve major leylines intersected</strong>, creating a natural gateway between the Material Plane and the Feywild. The Atlanteans were humanity's first successful experiment in <em>dimensional existence</em>:
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Material Anchor:</strong> Physical bodies, agriculture, industry, technology existed on Earth</li>
            <li><strong>Feywild Resonance:</strong> Consciousness, magic, art, dreams extended into the Feywild</li>
            <li><strong>Leyline Bridge:</strong> The Eye of the Sahara's twelve-fold leyline nexus maintained the connection</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Imagine a civilization where every citizen lived in <em>two worlds at once</em>. Their bodies walked Material streets, but their minds touched the infinite possibility of the Feywild. They weren't fully human, and they weren't fully Fae. They were <strong>Homo Atlanticus</strong>—the Between People.
        </p>

        <div class="atlantean-glow">
            <h4>The Leyline Nexus Architecture</h4>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                The Eye of the Sahara is a geological formation consisting of concentric rings. The Atlanteans didn't <em>build</em> on this formation—<strong>they built it into a machine</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul class="manuscript-list">
                <li><strong>Outer Ring (Diameter: 40km):</strong> Leyline capacitors—massive stone circles storing dimensional energy</li>
                <li><strong>Middle Ring (Diameter: 25km):</strong> Distribution network—channels routing power to the city core</li>
                <li><strong>Inner Ring (Diameter: 10km):</strong> The City of Atlantis—spires, gardens, archives, temples</li>
                <li><strong>Central Nexus (Diameter: 2km):</strong> The Dimensional Anchor—a crystalline obelisk maintaining the Feywild bridge</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                This wasn't a city. It was a <strong>dimensional engine</strong>, using Earth's natural leylines to keep Atlantis anchored in both realities.

        <h2>The First Cataclysm: How Atlantis Was Lost</h2>

        <h3>Year -50,000 BCE: The Deluge</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Approximately 52,000 years ago, Earth experienced the <strong>First Cataclysm</strong>—an event Draconid archivists refer to as "The Deluge." Geological records show catastrophic global flooding, but the <em>cause</em> remains unknown. However, the Atlanteans know. They <strong>remember</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <h4>What Caused the Deluge</h4>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                A rogue leyline surge—similar to what would later happen with the Theslar Event. An unknown event (possibly a meteor impact, supervolcano, or dimensional rupture) destabilized Earth's leyline network. The surge traveled through interconnected leylines like a shockwave through neural pathways.
            </p>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                When the surge reached the Eye of the Sahara, the <strong>twelve-fold leyline nexus overloaded</strong>. The dimensional bridge holding Atlantis in dual-reality <em>shattered</em>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Severance</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the leyline nexus collapsed, Atlantis faced a choice: anchor fully to the Material Plane or phase entirely into the Feywild. The city's architects chose the latter. In the span of three days, Atlantis <strong>disappeared</strong> from Earth:

        <h3>How the Sundering Brought Them Back</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Theslar Event (Year 0) didn't just tear open the Void—it <strong>supercharged Earth's leyline network</strong>. The massive influx of extradimensional energy, combined with catastrophic earthquakes, reactivated dormant leyline pathways that had been dead for 50,000 years.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            By Year 412, enough leylines had regenerated that the Eye of the Sahara's twelve-fold nexus <em>reignited</em>. From the Feywild side, the Atlanteans detected the sudden reopening of their ancient gateway. After 50,000 years of exile, the door home had opened.

            <li><strong>Reality Bleeding:</strong> Feywild entities (sprites, wisps, minor Fae) randomly manifest in city streets.</li>
            <li><strong>Leyline Glow:</strong> The entire city emits soft teal bioluminescence from leyline-powered infrastructure.</li>

        <h3>Neutral Isolationists (But Watching)</h3>

            Since their return in Year 412, the Atlanteans have adopted a policy of <strong>strict isolationism</strong>:

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>No territorial expansion:</strong> Atlantis claims only the Eye of the Sahara and 100km radius around it</li>
            <li><strong>No alliances:</strong> Refuses diplomatic relations with all factions ("You are children playing with matches")</li>
            <li><strong>No trade:</strong> Atlantis is self-sufficient via Feywild conjuration and leyline farming</li>
            <li><strong>No military intervention:</strong> Will not participate in factional wars</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            However, they are <em>not</em> completely withdrawn. Atlantean scouts monitor leyline activity globally, Feywild rifts, and Void saturation. They are gathering data, studying the post-Sundering world, and waiting.

        <h2>The Grimdark Tragedy of Atlantis</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Atlantis's return is not a <em>triumph</em>—it is a <strong>slow-motion funeral</strong>. The Atlanteans came home to a world that no longer wants them, piloting bodies that can no longer reproduce, clinging to memories of an Earth that died 50,000 years ago.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Atlantis Is Doomed</h3>

        <div class="atlantean-glow">
            <p class="manuscript-text"><strong>1. Terminal Sterility</strong></p>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                50,000 years in the Feywild rendered Atlanteans nearly sterile. Birth rate: 1 per 1,000 attempts. Current population: ~47,000. At current birth/death rates (accounting for accidents, Void exposure), Atlantis will be extinct in <strong>3,000-5,000 years</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="manuscript-text"><strong>2. Feywild Dependency</strong></p>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                Atlanteans can no longer survive purely in Material reality. They require periodic "immersion" in Feywild energy (minimum 6 hours per week). If the leyline nexus fails again, they have <em>weeks</em> before physical degradation begins.
            </p>

            <p class="manuscript-text"><strong>3. Temporal Erosion</strong></p>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                Living in non-linear time for 50,000 years damaged Atlantean neurological patterns. They experience "temporal echoes"—memories of futures that never happened, dreams of pasts they didn't live. 8% of Atlanteans suffer permanent temporal psychosis (lost in time, unable to distinguish past/present/future).
            </p>

            <p class="manuscript-text"><strong>4. Cultural Stagnation</strong></p>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                Because they're functionally immortal, Atlantean culture has <em>stopped evolving</em>. No generational turnover means no new ideas, no fresh perspectives. They are a civilization frozen in amber, slowly forgetting how to change.
            </p>

            <p class="manuscript-text"><strong>5. Existential Loneliness</strong></p>
            <p class="manuscript-text">
                The Atlanteans are <strong>cosmically alone</strong>. They remember an Earth with megafauna, ice age glaciers, and Neanderthals. Everyone they knew outside Atlantis died 50,000 years ago. They returned to a world of strangers who view them as aliens. Many suffer profound depression.

        <h3>The Atlantean Question</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            High Architect Thalassar's answer: <em>"Because home is not a place. Home is a promise. And we promised we would return. Even if no one remembers. Even if no one cares. We came home."</em>
