            <p class="npc-description">
                The eldest female smith and spiritual leader of all Crucible Pacts. Kerra leads as high priestess, interpreting the First Forge's will through volcanic omens, blessing ancestral weapons, and guiding Pack traditions. She earned her title "The Unburnt" during her ascension trial—standing barefoot in flowing lava for 3 minutes without suffering a single burn. Witnesses claim the lava parted around her feet. She claims the Forge protected its faithful.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Kerra is the spiritual counterbalance to Ashen-King Torrak's military authority. While Torrak leads in war, Kerra determines which wars are honorable. She has absolute veto power over duels, declaring them "sacred" or "profane." Profane duel-winners are exiled regardless of victory. This makes her both revered and feared—even the Ashen-King cannot challenge her spiritual authority without risking divine punishment.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"The Forge does not forgive weakness, but it despises dishonor more. A coward with a blade is still a coward. The flame knows."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Severe, mystical, absolutely convinced of divine mandate. Views every volcanic eruption as prophecy. Interprets combat outcomes as cosmic judgment. Growing increasingly apocalyptic in visions—claims the First Forge is "preparing for final purification."</p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                War Leader of the Ironpeak Pack, descended from original Forge-Clan kings through 12 generations—noble bloodline earning him the name "The Lineage." Trained from age 5 in dueling, he won his first sanctioned duel at age 15 (killing an adult rival). Became Ashen-King at age 28 by challenging and defeating the previous king. Holds an undefeated record: 47 duels, 47 victories. Covered in duel scars (one per victory), dual-wields volcanic blades 6 generations old.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Torrak is arrogant, glory-seeking, and obsessed with honor. His personal goal: challenge the strongest warrior in the world to prove Crucible superiority. He views other factions as potential opponents rather than enemies or allies—everyone is a future duel waiting to happen. His combat philosophy: "If you can't beat me in single combat, your entire ideology is worthless."
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"I have never lost because I have never fought without honor. The Forge rewards the worthy. I am worthy. You are not."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Supremely confident, obsessed with personal glory, rigid adherence to honor codes. Views politics as weakness—believes strength determines truth. Increasingly seeking legendary opponents to fight. Some fear he's planning suicide-by-champion, seeking glorious death rather than aging into weakness.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="npc-description">
                The greatest weaponsmith of her generation, Ryka forges every blade used in sacred duels. She works exclusively with Ancestral Iron—metal recovered from pre-Sundering machinery, melted in volcanic heat, folded 1,000 times, and quenched in the First Forge's sacred lava. Each weapon takes 6 months to complete. Each is unique. Each is considered a living artifact with its own spirit.
            </p>
            <p class="npc-description">
                Ryka is unusual among Crucible Pacts: she refuses to fight. "My weapon is the hammer. I forge blades for warriors, but I am not one." This makes her simultaneously respected (as master craftsman) and suspected (for not proving worth in combat). She claims the Forge called her to create, not destroy. Some whisper she's secretly afraid of dying and uses craftsmanship as excuse to avoid duels.
            </p>
            <div class="npc-quote">"I have forged 1,200 blades. Each has killed. Each has tasted blood. But these hands remain clean. That is my honor."</div>
            <p class="npc-description"><strong>Personality:</strong> Artistic, introspective, secretly pacifist (by Crucible standards). Believes creation is more honorable than destruction. Growing conflict with traditional warriors who view non-combatants as unworthy. May be forced into duel to prove legitimacy.</p>
