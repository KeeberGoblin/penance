            <p class="npc-description">
                The spiritual and military leader of the Church of Absolution. Marius underwent the Shortening at age 26 after witnessing his entire family die in the Sundering's aftermath. He has piloted his Casket, <em>The Crimson Penitent</em>, for 42 years without rest—wheelchair-bound outside his machine, sermon-delivering from within it. Known for his powerful sermons and merciless combat doctrine: "Every kill is a prayer. Every victory brings salvation closer."
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Marius is both revered and feared. He personally leads the Church's most brutal campaigns, believing that leadership demands the greatest suffering. His body bears the scars of countless Blood Offerings—his chest is a patchwork of ritual scars, each representing a victory bought with his own blood. Some whisper he's gone mad from pain, but his tactical brilliance remains unmatched.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "In iron we seek forgiveness. Through blood, absolution. When the enemy falls, we are one step closer to redemption."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Zealous, merciless, charismatic. Believes suffering is the only path to salvation. Demands absolute obedience but shares every hardship with his followers. Views mercy as weakness and compromise as heresy.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                A controversial figure within the Church, Evangeline earned her title "The Merciful" by offering enemies a choice: conversion or death. While this may seem compassionate by Church standards, she's notorious for making the conversion process deliberately unbearable—demanding immediate Shortening ceremonies in the field, performed without anesthetic or proper medical care. Most choose death.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                She pilots <em>The Absolution's Grace</em>, a heavily modified Casket equipped with loudspeakers that broadcast sermons during battle. Evangeline believes that enemies should understand WHY they're being killed—that each death is a prayer for humanity's redemption. She records final confessions from dying foes and inscribes them on her Casket's armor.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "I offer you salvation. Take it, or I will send you to judgment. Either way, you serve the Church."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Fanatically devout but believes in "redemptive mercy." Sees herself as saving enemies by forcing conversion. Disturbing mix of genuine compassion and brutal zealotry. Some view her as the Church's future; others see her as dangerously radical.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                One of the few Church members who has never piloted a Casket or undergone the Shortening. Tomas maintains the <em>Great Prayer Ledger</em>—an enormous tome recording every kill made by Church pilots, organized by date, pilot name, enemy faction, and method of death. He believes this ledger will be presented to the divine at humanity's final judgment.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Tomas is physically unremarkable—gaunt, pale, with ink-stained fingers and failing eyesight from decades of meticulous record-keeping. But his influence is enormous. He determines which kills "count" toward salvation, adjudicates disputes over prayer credits, and can strike names from the ledger for infractions—essentially declaring someone's suffering worthless.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "Three thousand, four hundred and twelve prayers recorded this month. We are seventeen percent behind last year's pace. Unacceptable."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Obsessively meticulous, emotionally detached, bureaucratically ruthless. Views war as mathematics—souls tallied, prayers counted, redemption calculated. Some pilots fear him more than High Confessor Marius because he controls the meaning of their suffering.

            <p class="npc-description">
                The Church's greatest tactical mind and most aggressive field commander. Aric earned his title "Bloodied Banner" during the Siege of Thornwood (Year 421), where he led a suicidal charge against Elven positions—his Casket's banner literally soaked in the blood of 47 consecutive kills. The banner has never been washed and now hangs in Cathedral Prime as a holy relic.
            </p>

            <p class="npc-description">
                Unlike many Church pilots who pilot from grim duty, Aric genuinely loves combat. He views battle as sacred art—each kill a brushstroke in humanity's salvation. He personally trains all Penitent Knights and is known for brutal "live fire" training exercises that have a 15% fatality rate. He considers this acceptable losses for producing elite warriors.
            </p>

            <div class="npc-quote">
                "The weak pray for mercy. The strong pray with their blades. I am a very devout man."
            </div>

            <p class="npc-description">
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Aggressive, glory-seeking, genuinely pious but interprets doctrine to justify violence. Charismatic leader who inspires fanatical loyalty. Views war as the highest form of worship. Rumored to be positioning himself to challenge High Confessor Marius for leadership.
