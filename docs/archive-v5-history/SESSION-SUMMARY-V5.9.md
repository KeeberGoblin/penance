# Session Summary - v5.9 Balance Implementation

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Session Goal:** Target strongest (Church 93% WR) and weakest (Emergent 0% WR) factions
**Database Version:** 5.8 → 5.9

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Church Equipment Nerfs
**Target:** Reduce dominance through damage tuning

**Changes Applied:**
- Nerfed 7 high-DPS cards (2.0 DPS → 1.5 DPS)
- Crush: 4 → 3 damage
- Pommel Bash: 2 → 1 damage
- Crushing Blow: 4 → 3 damage
- Thrust (3 instances): 4 → 3 damage
- Wild Swing: 4 → 3 damage
- Holy Smite: 2 → 1 damage
- Radiant Bolt: 4 → 3 damage

**Result:** Church 93.3% → 88.9% WR (-4.4% only)

**Conclusion:** Damage nerfs insufficient - Church's "cannot miss" and "ignore Defense" mechanics are the real problem.

---

### 2. Emergent Equipment Fixes
**Target:** Make unplayable faction (0% WR) viable

**Root Cause Discovered:** All 11 equipment cards had lowercase "type": "attack/reactive/utility" instead of "Attack/Reactive/Utility" - simulator rejected ALL cards!

**Changes Applied:**
1. Fixed type capitalization on all 11 cards
2. Increased damage on 2 key cards:
   - Hive Claw: 3 → 5 damage
   - Swarm Rush: 3 → 5 damage
3. Added baseline effects to conditional cards:
   - Hive-Mind Shield: Now reduces 2 damage baseline (was 0 without allies)
   - Apex Form Strike: Removed "Requires Metamorph" restriction
   - Metamorphic Barrier: Changed "Must be in Metamorph" to "bonus if in Metamorph"
4. Simplified ally-dependent effects to be optional bonuses, not requirements

**Result:** Emergent 0% → 75.6% WR (+75.6%!)

**Conclusion:** Fix worked TOO well - went from unplayable to overpowered. Over-corrected on damage values.

---

### 3. Database Version Update
- Changed version: 5.8 → 5.9
- Updated description with all changes
- Updated lastUpdated date

---

### 4. v5.9 Verification Simulation
- Ran 225 battles (10 factions × 9 matchups × 5 runs)
- Runtime: ~3 minutes
- Discovered unexpected meta shifts

---

### 5. Comprehensive Results Documentation
Created [V5.9-RESULTS.md](V5.9-RESULTS.md) with:
- Full change log
- Simulation results comparison
- Meta shift analysis
- Root cause analysis for each faction
- Recommended v5.10 changes

---

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Type Capitalization Critical Bug
**Impact:** Single-character change ("attack" → "Attack") caused +76% WR swing for Emergent

**Root Cause:** Simulator's card type checking is case-sensitive
```python
attack_cards = [c for c in hand if c.type == "Attack"]  # Not "attack"
```

**Lesson:** Always verify card type formatting matches simulator expectations

---

### 2. Church Dominance is Mechanic-Based, Not Damage-Based
**Evidence:**
- Nerfed 7 cards by -1 damage each
- Only achieved -4.4% WR reduction (93% → 89%)
- Expected: -15 to -20% reduction

**Analysis:**
- Church's "cannot miss" mechanics guarantee hits regardless of damage
- "Ignore Defense" mechanics bypass opponent's defensive stats
- Reactive defense cards (Righteous Parry, Divine Shield) untouched
- Only 12.5% of card pool was nerfed (7 of 56 cards)

**Conclusion:** Need to nerf mechanics ("cannot miss" → "advantage on roll"), not just damage

---

### 3. Token Economies Broken Without Payoff Cards
**Exchange: 11% → 0% WR** (got WORSE in v5.9!)
- Generates 2-3 Credits per card
- ZERO equipment cards spend Credits
- Dead card slots = auto-loss

**Bloodlines: 22% → 11% WR** (also got worse)
- Generates 2 Biomass per card (v5.1 buff)
- Only a few equipment cards spend Biomass
- Economy advantage wasted in equipment-only mode

**Lesson:** Resource generation cards need matching resource-spending cards in same equipment pool

---

### 4. Natural Meta Shifts Occur
**Elves: 62% → 53% WR** (NO direct changes!)
- Became balanced due to stronger opponents emerging
- Emergent/Nomads/Church beat Elves more often
- Natural stabilization

**Ossuarium: 58% → 49% WR** (NO changes since v5.3!)
- Finally balanced after 6 versions
- Meta shifts pushed them into target range

**Lesson:** Not all balance requires direct intervention - meta evolution matters

---

### 5. Over-Buffing When Fixing Broken Factions
**Emergent case study:**
- Should have: Fixed type capitalization, tested, THEN adjusted damage
- Actually did: Fixed types + increased damage simultaneously
- Result: 0% → 76% WR (over-corrected)

**Lesson:** When fixing broken factions, make minimal changes first, verify, then iterate

---

## v5.9 Balance Status

**Balanced Factions (45-55% WR): 2/10**
- ✅ Elves: 53.3% WR (natural stabilization)
- ✅ Ossuarium: 48.9% WR (natural stabilization)

**Overpowered (>65% WR): 4/10**
- ⚠️ Church: 88.9% WR (needs mechanic nerfs)
- ⚠️ Nomads: 86.7% WR (needs further damage nerfs)
- ⚠️ Emergent: 75.6% WR (needs damage reduction)
- ⚠️ Crucible: 73.3% WR (needs damage reduction)

**Underpowered (<45% WR): 4/10**
- ⚠️ Dwarves: 40.0% WR (meta shifted against them)
- ⚠️ Wyrd: 22.2% WR (needs damage buffs)
- ⚠️ Bloodlines: 11.1% WR (needs spending cards)
- ❌ Exchange: 0.0% WR (needs spending cards URGENTLY)

**Improvement:** v5.8 had 1/10 balanced, v5.9 has 2/10 balanced (+100%!)

---

## Recommended Next Steps (v5.10)

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix Exchange** (0% WR is unplayable)
   - Add Credit-spending effects to existing cards
   - Design: "Deal X damage OR Spend Y Credits to deal Z damage"

2. **Nerf Emergent** (over-buffed to 76% WR)
   - Hive Claw: 5 → 4 damage
   - Swarm Rush: 5 → 4 damage

3. **Nerf Church** (mechanic changes, not damage)
   - Righteous Wrath: "Cannot miss" → "Advantage on attack roll"
   - Divine Smite: "Ignore Defense" → "Bypass 1 Defense"

### Secondary Priority
4. **Nerf Nomads** (still 87% WR after v5.8 nerf)
   - Quick Slash: 4 → 3 damage
   - Sniper Shot: 5 → 4 damage

5. **Nerf Crucible** (73% WR, over-buffed in v5.8)
   - Ember Strike: 5 → 4 damage

6. **Fix Bloodlines** (11% WR, economy broken)
   - Add Biomass-spending effects

7. **Buff Wyrd** (22% WR, chaos mechanics underperform)
   - Increase baseline damage on all cards by +1

## Key Quotes from User

1. "Lets do some runs with this update" - Initiated v5.6 testing
2. "Alright, time for 5.8" - Moved to v5.8 after v5.7 results
3. **"Lets start with the strongest and weakest."** - This session's directive for v5.9

---

## Session Duration

Approximately 15-20 minutes of active work:
- 5 minutes: Church equipment analysis + nerfs
- 5 minutes: Emergent equipment analysis + fixes
- 3 minutes: Simulation run
- 5 minutes: Results documentation

---

## Next Session Recommendation

**Focus:** Address the 4 broken factions:
1. Exchange (0% WR) - CRITICAL
2. Bloodlines (11% WR) - HIGH
3. Emergent (76% WR, over-buffed) - HIGH
4. Church (89% WR, still dominant) - MEDIUM

**Approach:**
- Exchange/Bloodlines: Add spending cards (design work required)
- Emergent: Quick damage nerf
- Church: Mechanic changes (more complex)

**Expected Outcome:** 4-5/10 factions balanced (40-50% achievement)
