# Session Summary - v5.16 Balance Iteration

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Session Goal:** Apply targeted balance changes based on v5.15 baseline (real mechanics)
**Previous Version:** 5.15 (real mechanics, no multipliers, baseline data)
**New Version:** 5.16 (first balance pass on equipment damage)

---

- Death Grip: 6 ‚Üí 5 damage (-1)
- Soul Reaper: 7 ‚Üí 6 damage (-1)
- Corpse Harvest: 5 ‚Üí 4 damage (-1)

**Result:** 93.3% ‚Üí 86.7% WR (-6.6%)
**Assessment:** ‚ùå INSUFFICIENT - Still massively overpowered

---

### 2. Nomads Equipment Buffs (+1 damage)

**Rationale:** 24% WR in v5.15 ‚Üí Target 50%

### Faction Win Rates

| Faction | v5.15 WR | v5.16 WR | Change | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Ossuarium** | 93.3% | **86.7%** | -6.6% | üö® Still Critical OP |
| **Exchange** | 66.7% | **77.8%** | +11.1% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Got WORSE! |
| **Bloodlines** | 82.2% | **77.8%** | -4.4% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Still Very OP |
| **Emergent** | 44.4% | **57.8%** | +13.4% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Now OP |
| **Wyrd** | 51.1% | **51.1%** | 0.0% | ‚úÖ **BALANCED** |

## Unexpected Results

### 1. Exchange Got WORSE (+11% WR)

**v5.15:** 66.7% WR (overpowered)
**v5.16:** 77.8% WR (much more overpowered!)

**Why?**
- Equipment changes were faction-neutral (affected all factions equally)
- Exchange's Credit economy becomes relatively stronger when base damage is more balanced
- Credits provide flat +damage bonuses that scale better in lower-damage environment

**Lesson:** Resource economies scale differently with base damage changes

---

### 2. Church Got WORSE (-9% WR)

**v5.15:** 24.4% WR (very underpowered)
**v5.16:** 15.6% WR (critical underpowered!)

**Why?**
- Ossuarium's nerf reduced average fight duration
- Shorter fights = less time for Church's self-harm bonuses to matter
- Church has no resource economy to compensate like Exchange

**Lesson:** Defensive/sustain factions suffer in faster meta

---

### 3. Crucible Dropped Too Much (-13% WR)

**v5.15:** 57.8% WR (slightly overpowered)
**v5.16:** 44.4% WR (underpowered)

**Why?**
- Crucible relies on Forge tokens for bonus damage
- Lower base damage environment makes Forge bonuses less impactful relatively
- Needs +1 damage to Forge spending effects

**Lesson:** Resource-based factions sensitive to base damage environment

---

### 4. Emergent Became OP (+13% WR)

**v5.15:** 44.4% WR (slightly underpowered)
**v5.16:** 57.8% WR (overpowered)

**Why?**
- Emergent has consistent damage output without resource economy
- Benefited from weaker Ossuarium (less oppressive matchup)
- No equipment changes targeted Emergent

**Lesson:** Indirect meta shifts can flip faction power levels

---

## Analysis: Why Equipment-Only Changes Failed

### Problem 1: Lifesteal Scaling

**Ossuarium's True Power:**
- Not just high damage (5-7)
- But high damage + lifesteal on every card
- Reducing damage 5‚Üí4 reduces both offense AND sustain
- But lifesteal still provides 80-100% recovery (just 1 less card per hit)

**Impact of -1 damage:**
- Offensive reduction: ~17% (-1 from 6)
- Sustain reduction: ~17% (-1 card recovered)
- **Net power reduction: ~30%** (multiplicative)
- **Needed reduction for 87% ‚Üí 50%: ~43%**

**Conclusion:** Need -2 damage across Ossuarium equipment, not -1

---

### Problem 2: No Lifesteal on Nomads

**Nomads' True Weakness:**
- Low damage (4-5) with no sustain
- Mobility effects don't work in simulator
- No resource economy

**Impact of +1 damage:**
- Offensive increase: ~20% (+1 from 5)
- Sustain increase: 0% (no lifesteal)
- **Net power increase: ~20%**
- **Needed increase for 24% ‚Üí 50%: ~108%**

**Conclusion:** Need +2-3 damage on Nomads, OR add sustain mechanics

---

### Problem 3: Resource Economies Dominate

**Factions with Working Economies:**
1. **Exchange (Credits):** 77.8% WR
2. **Bloodlines (Biomass):** 77.8% WR
3. **Emergent (None):** 57.8% WR
4. **Wyrd (None):** 51.1% WR

**Factions with Broken/Weak Economies:**
1. **Church (Self-Harm):** 15.6% WR ‚ùå
2. **Dwarves (Rune Counters):** 22.2% WR ‚ùå
3. **Nomads (None):** 31.1% WR ‚ùå

**Conclusion:** Resource economies are too powerful. Need to nerf economy effects, not just base damage.

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Equipment-Only Balance Is Insufficient

**Reasoning:**
- Equipment affects all factions similarly (everyone uses equipment)
- Faction-specific cards define power (6 random cards from 21)
- Resource economies scale independently of equipment damage

**New Approach:**
- Nerf resource generation/spending costs
- Buff faction-specific card quality
- Equipment changes as secondary tuning

---

### 2. Lifesteal is Multiplicatively Powerful

**Math:**
- Pure damage faction: 100 HP, deals 6 damage = ~17 turns to kill
- Lifesteal faction: 100 HP, deals 6 damage + recovers 6 = ~infinite durability

**In card-as-HP system:**
- Damage = reduce opponent deck
- Lifesteal = add to your deck
- **Net advantage = 2√ó the damage value**

**Solution:** Nerf Ossuarium damage by 2+ points, not 1

---

### 3. Resource Economies Create Power Outliers

**Top 4 Factions:**
1. Ossuarium: 86.7% (lifesteal = economy)
2. Exchange: 77.8% (Credits economy)
3. Bloodlines: 77.8% (Biomass economy)
4. Emergent: 57.8% (no economy, but consistent)

**Bottom 3 Factions:**
1. Church: 15.6% (broken self-harm economy)
2. Dwarves: 22.2% (weak rune counter economy)
3. Nomads: 31.1% (no economy)

**Conclusion:** Working economy = 75%+ WR. No/broken economy = <35% WR.

---

### 4. Meta Speed Affects Faction Viability

**Fast Meta (v5.16):**
- Ossuarium nerfed ‚Üí fights end faster
- Exchange dominates (fast burst with Credits)
- Church suffers (needs time to accumulate discard bonuses)

**Lesson:** Balance changes affect more than direct targets

---

## Implementation Strategy for v5.17

### Phase 1: Economy Nerfs (Week 1)

**Goal:** Reduce resource economy advantage

1. Nerf Bloodlines Biomass (2‚Üí1 per kill, +1 spending costs)
2. Nerf Exchange Credits (1 per 2 attacks, +1 spending costs)
3. Nerf Ossuarium lifesteal (50% recovery, -1 additional damage)

**Expected Result:** Top 3 factions drop to 50-60% WR range

---

### Phase 2: Sustain Buffs (Week 1)

**Goal:** Give weak factions survival tools

1. Buff Church discard bonuses (double values)
2. Buff Dwarves rune counters (2 damage reduction per counter)
3. Add Nomads passive sustain (+1 HP per attack)

**Expected Result:** Bottom 3 factions rise to 40-45% WR range

---

### Phase 3: Damage Tuning (Week 2)

**Goal:** Fine-tune faction damage output

1. Buff Nomads equipment (+1 more damage, total +2)
2. Buff Crucible Forge effects (+1 damage per token)
3. Buff Elves Bleed (2 per stack)
4. Nerf Emergent slightly (-1 damage on top cards)

**Expected Result:** 6-7 factions in 45-55% WR range

---

### Phase 4: Testing & Iteration (Week 2)

**Goal:** Verify balance and iterate

1. Run v5.17 simulation (225 battles)
2. Analyze results
3. Make micro-adjustments if needed
4. Run v5.18 if necessary

**Target:** 7-8/10 factions in 45-55% WR range

## Files Modified

### 1. `/workspaces/penance/docs/cards/complete-card-data.json`

- Updated description
- Modified 8 equipment card damage values

**Lines Modified:** ~30 lines

---

## Conclusion

**v5.16 was a LEARNING ITERATION, not a success:**

‚ùå Equipment-only changes insufficient
‚ùå Did not account for resource economy scaling
‚ùå Created unexpected meta shifts (Exchange, Church worse)
‚úÖ Identified that economies are the real problem
‚úÖ Wyrd remains naturally balanced (reference point)
‚úÖ Established baseline for v5.17 changes

**Key Insight:** Resource economies dominate balance. Equipment damage is secondary.

**Next Session:** Implement v5.17 with economy nerfs + faction-specific buffs.

**Long-Term Goal:** 7-8/10 factions in 45-55% WR range.
