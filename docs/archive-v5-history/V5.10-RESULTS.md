## v5.10 Changes Summary

### 1. Exchange Equipment Overhaul (0% → 47% WR)

**Problem:** Lowest WR in history, generating Credits with no payoff

**Solution:** Type capitalization + damage buffs + Credit-spending options on ALL cards

| Card | v5.9 | v5.10 | Change |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| Contract Blade | type: "attack", 3 dmg, gain 2 Credits | "Attack", 4 dmg, gain 1 Credit OR spend 3 Credits for 7 dmg | +1 dmg, spending option added |
| Mercenary Strike | 4 dmg, spend 1 Credit for 5 dmg | 5 dmg OR spend 2 Credits for 7 dmg + ignore Defense | +1 dmg, better payoff |
| Profit Margin | 5 dmg, gain Credits on kill | 6 dmg, gain 1 Credit on damage | +1 dmg, simpler effect |
| Calculated Assault | 3 dmg, gain 2-3 Credits | 4 dmg, gain 1 Credit OR spend 2 for 6 dmg + ignore Defense | +1 dmg, spending option |
| Liquidation Shot | 4 dmg, spend 2 Credits for +2 dmg | 5 dmg OR spend 2 Credits for 7 dmg + ignore Defense | +1 dmg, ignore Defense |
| Hostile Takeover | 6 dmg, spend all Credits for +1/ea | 7 dmg OR spend 4 Credits for 10 dmg + ignore Defense + unblockable | +1 dmg, massive payoff |
| Expense Report | type: "reactive", reduce 2, gain 2 Credits | "Reactive", reduce 2, gain 1 Credit | Type fix only |
| Insurance Policy | Requires 2 Credits to activate | Baseline 2 reduction OR spend 2 for 5 reduction | Added baseline effect |
| Golden Parachute | Requires 3 Credits, conditional effect | Baseline -2 dmg OR spend 3 for -4 dmg | Added baseline effect |
| Contract Breach | Deal 2 dmg, gain 2 Credits if damaged | Deal 2 dmg, gain 1 Credit always | Simplified |
| Asset Protection | Costs 1 Credit, affects ally | Costs 1 SP, affects self, OR spend 2 Credits for +4 Defense | Changed to self-target |

**Total:** 11 of 11 cards modified (100% overhaul!)

**Result:** Exchange 0% → 46.7% WR ✅ **BALANCED!**

---

### 2. Bloodlines Equipment Overhaul (11% → 69% WR)

**Problem:** Generating Biomass with few spending options, low damage

**Solution:** Type capitalization + damage buffs + Biomass-spending on ALL cards

| Card | v5.9 | v5.10 | Change |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| Savage Claw | type: "attack", 3 dmg, gain 2 Biomass | "Attack", 4 dmg, gain 1 Biomass OR spend 3 for 7 dmg | +1 dmg, spending option |
| Rending Bite | 4 dmg, conditional on allies | 5 dmg OR spend 2 Biomass for 7 dmg + Bleed 2 | +1 dmg, removed conditional |
| Alpha's Pounce | 5 dmg, conditional Biomass gain | 6 dmg, always gain 1 Biomass | +1 dmg, guaranteed gain |
| Feral Strike | 3 dmg, spend 1 Biomass for 4 dmg + Bleed 1 | 4 dmg OR spend 2 Biomass for 6 dmg + Bleed 2 | +1 dmg, better payoff |
| Predator's Ambush | 4 dmg, conditional +1 | 5 dmg, gain Biomass if moved | +1 dmg, changed effect |
| Bloodline Fury | 7 dmg, spend all for +1/ea, gain Heat | 7 dmg OR spend 4 for 11 dmg + ignore Defense + Bleed 3 | Same base, better payoff |
| Chitin Plating | type: "reactive", reduce 2, spend 1 for 3 | "Reactive", reduce 2 OR spend 2 for 4 | Type fix, better cost |
| Pack Defense | type: "reactive" | "Reactive" | Type fix only |

**Total:** 8 of 11 cards modified (73% overhaul)

**Result:** Bloodlines 11% → 68.9% WR ⚠️ **OVERPOWERED!**

---

### 3. Emergent Damage Nerfs (76% → 69% WR)

**Problem:** Over-buffed in v5.9 (0% → 76% swing was too much)

**Solution:** -1 damage on 3 key cards

| Card | v5.9 Damage | v5.10 Damage |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Hive Claw | 5 | 4 |
| Swarm Rush | 5 | 4 |
| Coordinated Assault | 5 | 4 |

**Result:** Emergent 75.6% → 68.9% WR (-6.7%, still too high)

---

### 4. Church Mechanic Nerfs (89% → 91% WR!)

**Problem:** "Ignore Defense" mechanics too strong

**Solution:** Changed to "bypass X Defense" (partial instead of full)

| Card | v5.9 Effect | v5.10 Effect |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Wild Swing | ignore Defense buffs | bypass 1 Defense |
| Void Bolt | ignore Defense buffs | bypass 1 Defense |
| Reality Tear | ignore Defense and Armor | bypass 2 Defense |

**Result:** Church 88.9% → 91.1% WR (+2.2%!) **FAILED - GOT STRONGER!**

---

### 5. Nomads Damage Nerfs (87% → 76% WR)

**Problem:** Still overpowered after v5.8 nerf

**Solution:** -1 damage on 3 core cards

| Card | v5.8/v5.9 Damage | v5.10 Damage |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| Quick Slash | 4 | 3 |
| Dash Strike | 4 (5 with move bonus) | 3 (4 with move) |
| Sniper Shot | 5 | 4 |

**Result:** Nomads 86.7% → 75.6% WR (-11.1%, improved but still OP)

---

### 6. Crucible Damage Nerfs + Type Fixes (73% → 64% WR)

**Problem:** Over-buffed in v5.8 terrain fix, lowercase types

**Solution:** -1 damage on 2 cards + type capitalization on all

| Card | v5.9 | v5.10 | Change |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| Ember Strike | type: "Attack", 5 dmg | 4 dmg | -1 dmg |
| Volcanic Cleave | type: "attack" | "Attack" | Type fix |
| Molten Hammer | type: "attack", 5 dmg, ignore armor | "Attack", 4 dmg, bypass 1 Defense | -1 dmg, mechanic change |
| Cinder Slash | type: "attack" | "Attack" | Type fix |
| Forge Spear Throw | type: "attack" | "Attack" | Type fix |
| Duelist's Finisher | type: "attack" | "Attack" | Type fix |
| Lava-Forged Shield | type: "reactive" | "Reactive" | Type fix |

**Result:** Crucible 73.3% → 64.4% WR (-8.9%, improved but still high)

## Critical Analysis

### Success Story: Exchange (0% → 47% WR)

**Why it worked:**

1. **Type capitalization unlocked ALL 11 cards**
   - Same issue as Emergent in v5.9
   - Simulator rejected lowercase "attack"/"reactive"/"utility"

2. **Damage buffs provided baseline viability**
   - +1 to +2 damage across all attack cards
   - Cards now trade evenly even without spending Credits

3. **"OR" spending options = flexible economy**
   - Every card works without Credits (baseline effect)
   - Spending Credits provides bonus damage + ignore Defense
   - Players can choose: save Credits or spend for burst

4. **"Ignore Defense" on spending options = payoff**
   - Mercenary Strike: spend 2 Credits for ignore Defense
   - Calculated Assault: spend 2 Credits for ignore Defense
   - Liquidation Shot: spend 2 Credits for ignore Defense
   - Hostile Takeover: spend 4 Credits for ignore Defense + unblockable

**Example card that embodies the fix:**
```
Contract Blade (v5.9):
  Deal 3 damage. Gain 2 Credit tokens.
  Problem: Weak damage, generates Credits with no use

Contract Blade (v5.10):
  Deal 4 damage. Gain 1 Credit. OR: Spend 3 Credits to deal 7 damage.
  Solution: Viable baseline (4 dmg), powerful payoff (7 dmg)
```

**Lesson:** Token economy cards need BOTH baseline viability AND spending payoff.

---

### Surprise Success: Bloodlines (11% → 69% WR)

**Why it worked TOO well:**

1. **Type capitalization** (same as Exchange)
2. **Damage buffs** (+1 to +2 across all cards)
3. **Biomass-spending options added** to ALL attack cards
4. **High damage payoffs:**
   - Savage Claw: spend 3 Biomass for 7 damage
   - Rending Bite: spend 2 Biomass for 7 damage + Bleed 2
   - Feral Strike: spend 2 Biomass for 6 damage + Bleed 2
   - Bloodline Fury: spend 4 Biomass for 11 damage + ignore Defense + Bleed 3

5. **"Ignore Defense" on finisher**
   - Bloodline Fury payoff includes ignore Defense
   - Same problem as Church - bypasses defensive counterplay

**Over-correction factors:**
- 11 damage on Bloodline Fury is highest single-card damage in game (except Church Execute at 8 base)
- Multiple cards with 7 damage payoffs
- Bleed effects stack (2-3 damage over time adds up)

**Lesson:** When fixing weak factions, buff conservatively. Bloodlines went from weakest to 2nd strongest!

---

### Major Failure: Church (89% → 91% WR)

**Why nerfs BACKFIRED:**

1. **"Bypass X Defense" is STILL strong**
   - Changed "ignore Defense" → "bypass 1 Defense"
   - But 1 Defense bypass is still advantage vs 0 bypass
   - Didn't address root problem: bypassing defensive stats

2. **Only 3 cards changed**
   - Wild Swing, Void Bolt, Reality Tear
   - 3 of 56 total Church equipment cards = 5.4%
   - 95% of Church's toolkit unchanged

3. **v5.9 damage nerfs still applied**
   - -1 damage on 7 cards from v5.9
   - So Church has lower damage BUT better mechanics
   - This may have improved their efficiency

4. **Church got STRONGER against weak factions**
   - Wyrd went 22% → 0% (Church farms them)
   - Elves went 53% → 38% (Church wins more)
   - Ossuarium went 49% → 29% (Church dominates)
   - Dwarves went 40% → 18% (Church crushes)

**The math:**
- v5.9: Church beat weak factions, struggled vs strong factions
- v5.10: Weak factions got weaker, strong factions got nerfed
- Church now wins even MORE games because opponents are weaker

**Lesson:** Nerfing strong factions only works if weak factions also improve. Church's WR increased because the meta around them collapsed.

---

### Total Collapse: Wyrd (22% → 0% WR)

**Why Wyrd became unplayable:**

1. **NO changes applied to Wyrd**
   - Wyrd equipment unchanged since v5.7 (faction name fix)
   - Same 11-card pool, same damage values, same effects

2. **Type capitalization epidemic**
   - Possible lowercase "attack" types in Wyrd cards?
   - Need to verify - may have same issue as Exchange/Bloodlines/Emergent

3. **Facing buffed opponents:**
   - Exchange: 0% → 47% (now beats Wyrd)
   - Bloodlines: 11% → 69% (now crushes Wyrd)
   - Emergent: Still 69% (still beats Wyrd)

4. **High-variance chaos mechanics underperform:**
   - Wyrd designed for "reality distortion" and variance
   - Simulator favors consistent damage over variance
   - 2d6 damage cards too unpredictable

**Hypothesis:** Wyrd likely has lowercase type issues + fundamentally weak card pool.

**Immediate action needed:** Check Wyrd type capitalization.

---

### Meta Shift Casualties: Elves (53% → 38%) and Ossuarium (49% → 29%)

**Why balanced factions collapsed:**

1. **No direct changes** to Elves or Ossuarium
2. **Facing stronger opponents:**
   - Bloodlines: 11% → 69% (now farms Elves/Ossuarium)
   - Exchange: 0% → 47% (now competitive)
   - Church: Still dominant, possibly improved matchup spread

3. **Natural meta victims:**
   - v5.9: Elves/Ossuarium balanced because they beat weak factions
   - v5.10: Weak factions either fixed (Exchange) or removed (Wyrd)
   - Elves/Ossuarium have fewer "free wins"

**Lesson:** Fixing weak factions indirectly nerfs mid-tier factions by removing easy matchups.

---

### Dwarves Continued Decline (40% → 18%)

**Why Dwarves keep getting worse:**

1. **Defense-focused strategy**
   - Dwarves excel at stacking Defense
   - But many factions now have "ignore Defense" or "bypass Defense"
   - Their core strength is being hard-countered

2. **Slow, methodical playstyle**
   - Dwarves trade consistency for burst
   - Fast factions (Nomads, Bloodlines, Emergent) punish this

3. **No changes since v5.2**
   - Last balance pass was -1 damage on 5 cards
   - Dwarves need offensive buffs, not defensive ones

**Recommendation:** Dwarves need "ignore Defense on attack" effects to break through enemy defenses.

---

## Dice Mechanics Analysis

**v5.10 Dice Stats:**
- Total Rolls: 3,850 (+854 from v5.9's 2,996)
- Avg Hit Rate: 57.0% (-1.5% from v5.9's 58.5%)
- Catastrophic Failures: 7.8% (still 3× expected 2.78%)
- Executions: 2.5% (close to expected 2.78%)
- Critical Hits: 6.0% (+0.1% from v5.9's 5.9%)

**Observations:**
1. More total rolls = longer battles
2. Lower hit rate = more misses, slower kills
3. Catastrophic failures still too high
4. Critical hits still too low (6% vs 11% expected)

**Hypothesis:** Dice probabilities may be incorrectly weighted in simulator code.

- Bottom tier expanded (1 faction → 3 factions)

**Power distribution WORSENED despite massive changes.**

---

## Recommended v5.11 Changes

### Priority 1: Fix Wyrd (0% WR - CRITICAL!)

**Check type capitalization:**
```bash
jq '.equipment_items[] | select(.faction == "wyrd-conclave") | .cards[] | select(.type | test("attack|reactive|utility"; "i")) | {name, type}' complete-card-data.json
```

**If lowercase types found:** Fix all to capital-case
**If already capitalized:** Buff baseline damage by +1-2 across all cards

**Expected Impact:** 0% → 45-50% WR

---

### Priority 2: Nerf Bloodlines (69% → 55%)

**Problem:** Over-buffed damage + "ignore Defense" finisher

**Solution:**
1. Reduce Bloodline Fury damage: 7 → 6 baseline, 11 → 9 payoff
2. Remove "ignore Defense" from Bloodline Fury payoff
3. Reduce Savage Claw payoff: 7 → 6 damage

**Expected Impact:** -10 to -15% WR

---

### Priority 3: Nerf Church (91% → 55%)

**Problem:** Mechanic changes ineffective, WR increased

**Solution:** More aggressive mechanic nerfs + damage reductions
1. Remove ALL "bypass Defense" effects (not just some)
2. Further damage nerfs: -1 damage on top 10 highest-damage cards
3. Add costs to reactive cards (0 SP → 1 SP)

**Expected Impact:** -25 to -35% WR

---

### Priority 4: Nerf Nomads (76% → 55%)

**Problem:** Still overpowered after 2 rounds of nerfs

**Solution:** Further damage reduction
1. Quick Slash: 3 → 2 damage
2. Aimed Shot: 4 → 3 damage
3. Pinning Arrow: 4 → 3 damage

**Expected Impact:** -15 to -20% WR

---

### Priority 5: Buff Elves (38% → 50%)

**Problem:** Balanced faction became weak due to meta shift

**Solution:** Modest damage buffs
1. +1 damage on 3-5 core attack cards
2. OR add "bypass 1 Defense" to 2-3 cards

**Expected Impact:** +10 to +12% WR

---

### Priority 6: Buff Ossuarium (29% → 50%)

**Problem:** Balanced faction collapsed due to meta shift

**Solution:** Leverage lifesteal mechanic
1. +1 damage on attack cards with lifesteal
2. Add lifesteal to 2-3 more cards

**Expected Impact:** +15 to +20% WR

---

### Priority 7: Buff Dwarves (18% → 50%)

**Problem:** Defense-focused strategy hard-countered by "ignore Defense" meta

**Solution:** Add offensive counterplay
1. +2 damage on all attack cards
2. Add "ignore Defense" to 3-5 cards
3. Keep defensive toolkit unchanged

**Expected Impact:** +25 to +30% WR

---

## Key Lessons from v5.10

### 1. Type Capitalization is CRITICAL
- Exchange: 0% → 47% from single character fix
- Bloodlines: 11% → 69% (partially from type fix)
- Wyrd: Likely has same issue (needs verification)

**Action:** Create automated test to verify all equipment cards have capitalized types.

---

### 2. "Ignore Defense" is Overpowered Mechanic
- Church: Still dominant despite nerfs
- Exchange: Balanced with "ignore Defense" on spending options
- Bloodlines: Overpowered with "ignore Defense" on finisher

**Paradox:**
- Weak factions NEED "ignore Defense" to compete
- Strong factions ABUSE "ignore Defense" to dominate

**Solution:** Replace "ignore Defense" with "bypass X Defense" universally, tune X value per faction.

---

### 3. Token Economies Need BOTH Generation AND Spending
- Exchange (Credits): Fixed by adding spending to ALL cards
- Bloodlines (Biomass): Fixed by adding spending to ALL cards
- Emergent (Metamorph): Already had both

**Pattern:**
- Generation-only cards = dead slots = 0% WR
- Generation + spending on SAME card = flexible economy = balanced

**Lesson:** Every resource generator should also be a resource spender with "OR" option.

---

### 4. Nerfing Strong Factions Can Make Them STRONGER
- Church: 89% → 91% despite mechanic nerfs

**Why this happens:**
1. Nerf strong faction's mechanics
2. Weak factions get weaker (meta victims)
3. Strong faction has easier matchups
4. WR increases despite nerfs

**Solution:** Never nerf in isolation - always buff weak factions simultaneously.

---

### 5. Fixing Weak Factions Punishes Mid-Tier Factions
- Elves: 53% → 38% (no direct changes)
- Ossuarium: 49% → 29% (no direct changes)

**Why this happens:**
1. Fix weak factions (Exchange, Bloodlines)
2. Mid-tier loses "free win" matchups
3. Mid-tier WR drops

**Solution:** When fixing weak factions, also buff mid-tier to compensate.

---

### 6. Massive Multi-Faction Changes = Unpredictable Meta
- Changed 6 of 10 factions in one version
- Balance score DECREASED (2/10 → 1/10)
- Power distribution WORSENED

**Lesson:** Change 2-3 factions per version max. Allow meta to stabilize between versions.

---

## Conclusion

v5.10 was the most ambitious balance pass in Penance history:
- **11 Exchange cards overhauled** (100%)
- **8 Bloodlines cards overhauled** (73%)
- **3 Emergent cards nerfed**
- **3 Church cards changed**
- **3 Nomads cards nerfed**
- **7 Crucible cards modified**

**Total: 35 card changes across 6 factions**

**Results:**
- ✅ Exchange fixed (0% → 47% WR) - **Major success!**
- ⚠️ Bloodlines over-buffed (11% → 69% WR)
- ⚠️ Church nerf backfired (89% → 91% WR)
- ❌ Wyrd collapsed (22% → 0% WR)
- ❌ Elves/Ossuarium casualties (-15 to -20% WR each)
- ❌ Balance score regressed (2/10 → 1/10)

**Key Insight:** Large-scale changes create chaos. Smaller, targeted adjustments allow the meta to stabilize naturally.

**Next Steps (v5.11):**
1. Fix Wyrd (URGENT - 0% WR)
2. Nerf Bloodlines/Church/Nomads (surgical, not sweeping)
3. Buff Elves/Ossuarium/Dwarves (compensate meta victims)
4. Target: 5-6/10 factions balanced (50% achievement)
