## Key Insights

### Success: Crucible is Now Playable

**The Problem (v5.7):**
- Crucible had 0% WR due to terrain-dependent mechanics
- "Deal 3 damage. If on lava, deal 4 damage" ‚Üí simulator has no terrain system
- Equipment was always using worst-case damage values

**The Fix (v5.8):**
- Ember Strike: 3 dmg ‚Üí **5 dmg + Burn effect**
- Volcanic Ward: Conditional 3/4 reduction ‚Üí **3 reduction + Forge token generation**

**The Result:**
- 0% ‚Üí 80% WR (+80 percentage points!)
- Second-largest balance swing after Nomads (0% ‚Üí 95% in v5.7)
- **Now TOO strong** - over-corrected

---

### Success: Dwarves Achieved Balance

**Dwarves: 52.0% WR** (target: 45-55%)

- Dropped from 63% (v5.7) to 52% (v5.8)
- Natural stabilization as meta shifted around Crucible/Nomads changes
- No direct changes to Dwarves equipment
- **First faction to achieve balance in equipment-only testing!**

---

### Partial Success: Nomads Weakened But Still OP

**v5.7:** 95.1% WR (catastrophically overpowered)
**v5.8:** 86.7% WR (-8.4%, still very strong)

**Nerfs Applied:**
- -2 damage across all attack cards
- Removed "Cannot be blocked" from Sniper Shot

**Why Still Strong:**
- Average damage still ~4.2 per card (vs Church's 4.0)
- 8 cards total = very consistent deck
- Movement synergies (Dash Strike) still powerful
- May need -1 more damage across the board

---

### Church Unchanged, Still Dominant

**Church: 93.3% WR** (no change from v5.7)

No direct nerfs applied to Church in v5.8. Remains the strongest faction in equipment-only combat due to:
- 56 equipment cards (vs 8-13 for most factions)
- "Cannot miss" mechanics on multiple cards
- Perfect balance of offense/defense/utility

---

### Bottom 4 Factions Still Broken

| Faction | WR% | Issue |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Wyrd | 33% | Small card pool (11), weak token economy |
| Bloodlines | 22% | Small card pool (11), weak Biomass payoff |
| Exchange | 11% | Small card pool (11), weak Credit payoff |
| **Emergent** | **0%** | Swarm mechanics don't work in 1v1 |

**Common Pattern:** All have 11 equipment cards, compared to Church's 56 or even Nomads' 8. Small pools = low consistency.

**Emergent Specific Issue:** All cards require "allied units within X hexes" but simulator is 1v1 only. Literally every attack has 0 bonus damage.

---

## Recommended Changes for v5.9

### Priority 1: Nerf Crucible (CRITICAL - over-buffed)

**Current:** 80% WR (too strong)
**Target:** 50% WR

**Proposed Nerfs:**
1. **Ember Strike**: 5 damage ‚Üí 4 damage (keep Burn effect)
2. **Volcanic Cleave**: 4 damage ‚Üí 3 damage
3. **Molten Hammer**: 5 damage ‚Üí 4 damage

**Expected Impact:** 80% ‚Üí 55% WR

---

### Priority 2: Further Nerf Nomads

**Current:** 86.7% WR
**Target:** 50% WR

**Proposed Nerfs:**
1. **Quick Slash**: 4 damage ‚Üí 3 damage
2. **Whirlwind Slash**: 4 damage ‚Üí 3 damage

**Expected Impact:** 87% ‚Üí 60% WR

---

### Priority 3: Nerf Church (Long Overdue)

**Current:** 93.3% WR
**Target:** 50% WR

**Proposed Nerfs:**
1. Remove "Cannot miss" from 2-3 cards
2. -1 damage across 5-10 highest-damage cards
3. OR: Reduce card pool from 56 ‚Üí 30 cards

**Expected Impact:** 93% ‚Üí 65% WR (will need multiple rounds)

---

### Priority 4: Fix Emergent (Requires Simulator Update)

**Current:** 0% WR
**Issue:** All cards require allied units, but simulator is 1v1

**Options:**
1. **Add non-conditional cards** to Emergent pool (bypasses simulator limitation)
2. **Update simulator** to support summons/swarm units
3. **Accept 0% WR** and note "Emergent requires multi-unit support"

**Recommended:** Option 1 (add 5-10 simple damage cards without ally requirements)

---

## Version Progression Summary

| Version | Nomads WR | Crucible WR | Dwarves WR | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| v5.6 | **0%** | 11% | 71% | Nomads had no equipment |
| v5.7 | **95%** | **0%** | 63% | Nomads added (overpowered), Crucible terrain bug |
| v5.8 | **87%** | **80%** | **52%** | Nerfs/fixes applied, **Dwarves balanced!** |

**Progress:** 0/10 balanced (v5.6) ‚Üí 0/10 (v5.7) ‚Üí **1/10 (v5.8)**

---

## Conclusions

**Successes:**
1. ‚úÖ **Dwarves balanced at 52%** (first balanced faction in equipment-only testing!)
2. ‚úÖ **Crucible fixed** (0% ‚Üí 80%, playable again)
3. ‚úÖ **Nomads weakened** (95% ‚Üí 87%, moving in right direction)

**Failures:**
1. ‚ùå **Crucible over-buffed** (0% ‚Üí 80%, need to pull back)
2. ‚ùå **Church still untouched** (93% for 3 consecutive versions)
3. ‚ùå **Bottom 4 factions unchanged** (Wyrd, Bloodlines, Exchange, Emergent still 0-33%)

**Next Steps (v5.9):**
1. Nerf Crucible -1 damage across 3 cards
2. Nerf Nomads -1 more damage (Quick Slash, Whirlwind Slash)
3. Start Church nerfs (remove "Cannot miss" or reduce damage)
4. Add 5 simple cards to Emergent (no ally requirements)

**Overall Assessment:**
v5.8 is a **partial success**. We achieved our first balanced faction (Dwarves) and fixed two critical bugs (Crucible terrain, Nomads overpowered). However, we over-corrected on Crucible and still have Church/Nomads dominating the meta. The path forward is clear: gradual nerfs to top 5 factions (Church, Nomads, Crucible, Elves, Ossuarium) until 5-7 factions reach 45-55% range.
