# v5.11 Simulation Results - Technical Fixes Only

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Database Version:** 5.11
**Simulator:** faction_balance_DICE.py
**Test Scope:** 225 battles (10 factions × 9 matchups × 5 runs)
**Change Type:** Technical fixes only (NO balance changes)

---

## Executive Summary

v5.11 fixed critical type capitalization bugs affecting **28 equipment cards** across 4 factions:
- **Wyrd: 11 cards** (100% of equipment pool)
- **Ossuarium: 11 cards** (100% of equipment pool)
- **Crucible: 3 cards** (partial)
- **Bloodlines: 3 cards** (partial)

**Result:** Wyrd went from **0% → 27% WR** (+27%!), proving type capitalization was the root cause.

**No balance changes were made** - this is a pure technical optimization pass.

---

## The Type Capitalization Bug

### Root Cause

The simulator's card type checking is **case-sensitive**:

```python
# equipment_simulator_dice.py (line 583)
attack_cards = [c for c in casket.hand if isinstance(c, EquipmentCard) and c.type == "Attack"]
```

The code checks for `c.type == "Attack"` (capital A), not `"attack"` (lowercase a).

### Impact

Cards with lowercase types were **completely ignored** by the simulator:
- `"type": "attack"` → Card NEVER selected for attacks → 0 damage output
- `"type": "reactive"` → Card NEVER played defensively → 0 damage blocked
- `"type": "utility"` → Card NEVER activated → Effects never trigger

### Affected Factions

| Faction | Lowercase Cards | % of Equipment | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Wyrd** | 11 of 11 cards | 100% | **Unplayable** (0% WR in v5.10) |
| **Ossuarium** | 11 of 11 cards | 100% | **Severe** (29% → 27% WR, variance) |
| **Crucible** | 3 of 14 cards | 21% | **Moderate** (still 64% WR) |
| **Bloodlines** | 3 of 11 cards | 27% | **Moderate** (still 80% WR) |

**Total affected:** 28 of 223 equipment cards (12.6% of all equipment)

---

## Technical Changes Applied

### 1. Automated Type Capitalization

Created jq script to fix all lowercase types:

```jq
walk(
  if type == "object" and has("type") and (.type | type == "string") then
    .type |= (
      if . == "attack" then "Attack"
      elif . == "reactive" then "Reactive"
      elif . == "utility" then "Utility"
      elif . == "defense" then "Defense"
      else .
      end
    )
  else .
  end
)
```

Applied to entire database: `jq -f fix_types.jq complete-card-data.json`

### 2. Verification

**Before fix:**
```bash
jq '.equipment_items[] | .cards[] | select(.type | test("^[a-z]"))' | wc -l
# Output: 28
```

**After fix:**
```bash
jq '.equipment_items[] | .cards[] | select(.type | test("^[a-z]"))' | wc -l
# Output: 0
```

All 28 lowercase types successfully capitalized.

## v5.11 vs v5.10 Results Comparison

| Faction | v5.10 WR | v5.11 WR | Change | Analysis |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Church** | 91.1% | **93.3%** | +2.2% | Got stronger (opponents weaker) |
| **Bloodlines** | 68.9% | **80.0%** | +11.1% | Type fix helped remaining 73% of cards |
| **Crucible** | 64.4% | **64.4%** | 0.0% | No change (type fix was small %) |
| **Nomads** | 75.6% | **60.0%** | -15.6% | **Variance or meta shift?** |
| **Exchange** | 46.7% | **60.0%** | +13.3% | **Unexpected buff?** |
| **Emergent** | 68.9% | **55.6%** | -13.3% | Dropped into balance range! |
| **Ossuarium** | 28.9% | **26.7%** | -2.2% | Type fix expected +20-30%, got -2%? |
| **Wyrd** | 0.0% | **26.7%** | **+26.7%** | ✅ **Type fix worked!** |
| **Elves** | 37.8% | **22.2%** | -15.6% | Continued collapse |
| **Dwarves** | 17.8% | **11.1%** | -6.7% | Continued decline |

**Balance Score:**
- v5.10: 1/10 balanced (Exchange at 47%)
- v5.11: 0/10 balanced (Emergent at 56% is closest, just over threshold)

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Wyrd Type Fix Successful ✅

**Expected:** 0% → 45-50% WR (all 11 cards unlocked)
**Actual:** 0% → 26.7% WR

**Analysis:**
- Type fix WORKED (cards now usable)
- But 27% WR is still **very weak**
- Wyrd has fundamental design issues beyond type capitalization

**Root Cause:** Wyrd's chaos/variance mechanics underperform in simulator
- "2d6 damage" effects too inconsistent
- "Reality distortion" effects don't simulate properly
- Baseline damage values too low (3-4 damage most cards)

**Action Needed:** Wyrd needs +1-2 damage buffs across entire card pool

---

### 2. Ossuarium Type Fix FAILED ❌

**Expected:** 29% → 50-55% WR (all 11 cards unlocked)
**Actual:** 29% → 27% WR (-2%, within variance)

**This makes NO SENSE!** Ossuarium should have gained +20-30% WR from unlocking 100% of equipment pool.

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Variance:** Small sample size (225 battles), 2% change is noise
2. **Meta shift:** Stronger opponents (Bloodlines 69% → 80%, Exchange 47% → 60%)
3. **Ossuarium already broken:** Type fix revealed deeper issues
4. **Lifesteal not simulating:** Ossuarium's core mechanic may not work in simulator

**Action Needed:** Run 1,000+ battle extended simulation to verify if this is variance or real issue.

---

### 3. Emergent Accidentally Balanced! ✅

**v5.10:** 68.9% WR (overpowered)
**v5.11:** 55.6% WR (**near balanced!**)

**No changes to Emergent** - this is pure variance or meta shift.

**Analysis:**
- Type fixes to Wyrd/Ossuarium created new opponents
- Wyrd (0% → 27%) now beats Emergent sometimes
- Ossuarium's lifesteal (if working) might counter Emergent

**Status:** 55.6% is just outside 45-55% target, but VERY close. One small nerf would balance.

---

### 4. Bloodlines Over-Buffed Further ⚠️

**v5.10:** 68.9% WR (already overpowered)
**v5.11:** 80.0% WR (+11% worse!)

**Why?**
- 3 of 11 Bloodlines cards had lowercase types
- Type fix unlocked those 3 cards → more damage output
- Bloodlines already had high damage + Biomass-spending options
- Unlocking more cards pushed them over the edge

**Action Needed:** Bloodlines needs aggressive nerfs (-2 to -3 damage across multiple cards)

---

### 5. Exchange Unexpectedly Strong ⚠️

**v5.10:** 46.7% WR (balanced!)
**v5.11:** 60.0% WR (now overpowered)

**Why?**
- Exchange was JUST balanced in v5.10
- No changes to Exchange in v5.11
- Meta shift: Weaker opponents (Elves 38% → 22%, Dwarves 18% → 11%)

**Analysis:**
- Exchange's Credit-spending options are VERY strong
- "Ignore Defense" effects on all spending options
- May be over-tuned

**Action Needed:** Small nerf to Exchange spending options (reduce damage by -1 on payoffs)

---

### 6. Nomads Sharp Decline

**v5.10:** 75.6% WR
**v5.11:** 60.0% WR (-15.6%!)

**No changes to Nomads** - this is likely variance.

**Analysis:**
- Sample size variance (225 battles = high variance)
- OR meta shift (stronger opponents: Bloodlines, Exchange)
- OR dice variance (catastrophic failures increased 7.8% → 8.5%)

**Action Needed:** Monitor in next simulation. If still 60%, small nerf needed.

---

### 7. Bottom Tier Collapse

| Faction | v5.10 WR | v5.11 WR | Change |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| Elves | 37.8% | **22.2%** | -15.6% |
| Dwarves | 17.8% | **11.1%** | -6.7% |

**Why are weak factions getting WEAKER?**

1. **Stronger opponents:** Bloodlines, Exchange buffed
2. **No help:** Weak factions unchanged
3. **Power concentration:** Church/Bloodlines farm weak factions
4. **Defense obsolete:** Many factions now have "ignore Defense" or "bypass Defense"

**Elves and Dwarves are being pushed out of the meta entirely.**

**Action Needed:** Emergency buffs to Elves (+2-3 damage) and Dwarves (+3-4 damage + "ignore Defense")

---

## Church Dominance Analysis

**Church WR progression:**
- v5.9: 88.9%
- v5.10: 91.1% (+2.2%)
- v5.11: 93.3% (+2.2%)

**Church has gotten stronger for 3 versions straight** despite nerfs.

**Why?**

1. **No real nerfs applied:**
   - v5.9: -1 damage on 7 cards (12.5% of pool)
   - v5.10: Changed "ignore Defense" → "bypass 1-2 Defense" on 3 cards (5% of pool)
   - 95% of Church toolkit unchanged since v5.8

2. **56-card advantage:**
   - Church: 56 equipment cards (largest pool)
   - Most factions: 11-20 cards
   - Bigger pool = more consistency = higher WR

3. **Cannot-miss mechanics:**
   - Righteous Wrath: "Cannot miss"
   - Divine Smite: Ignores Defense
   - These are STILL in the game, unchanged

4. **Meta collapse benefits Church:**
   - Weak factions getting weaker → Church farms them
   - Strong factions nerfed → Church wins more
   - Church's WR increases even without buffs

**Conclusion:** Church needs AGGRESSIVE nerfs (not incremental tweaks).

## Dice Mechanics Analysis

### v5.11 Dice Stats

```
Total Rolls:        4,234 (+384 from v5.10's 3,850)
Avg Hit Rate:       59.2% (+2.2% from v5.10's 57.0%)
Cat. Failures:      8.5% (+0.7% from v5.10's 7.8%)
Executions:         2.7% (+0.2% from v5.10's 2.5%)
Critical Hits:      5.3% (-0.7% from v5.10's 6.0%)
```

### Trends

1. **Hit rate slowly increasing** (57% → 59%)
   - Still far below expected 72%
   - Defense stat may be too high in simulator

2. **Catastrophic failures too high** (8.5% vs 2.78% expected)
   - Consistent across all versions
   - Likely dice face distribution bug in simulator

3. **Critical hits too low** (5.3% vs 11.11% expected)
   - Consistent across all versions
   - May need to check double-success probability calculation

**Recommendation:** Audit dice probability code in simulator.

## Power Tier Visualization

```
S-Tier (>80% WR):
  v5.10: Church (91%)
  v5.11: Church (93%), Bloodlines (80%)

A-Tier (65-80% WR):
  v5.10: Bloodlines (69%)
  v5.11: None

B-Tier (55-65% WR):
  v5.10: Crucible (64%), Nomads (76%), Emergent (69%)
  v5.11: Crucible (64%), Nomads (60%), Exchange (60%)

NEAR-BALANCED (50-55% WR):
  v5.10: None
  v5.11: Emergent (56%)

BALANCED (45-55% WR):
  v5.10: Exchange (47%)
  v5.11: None

C-Tier (30-45% WR):
  v5.10: Elves (38%)
  v5.11: None

D-Tier (20-30% WR):
  v5.10: Ossuarium (29%), Wyrd (0%)
  v5.11: Ossuarium (27%), Wyrd (27%)

F-Tier (<20% WR):
  v5.10: Dwarves (18%)
  v5.11: Elves (22%), Dwarves (11%)
```

**Power distribution compressed at top, expanded at bottom.**

Church + Bloodlines now dominate S-tier with 80-93% WR.
Bottom 4 factions at 11-27% WR (nearly unplayable).

## Key Lessons

### 1. Type Capitalization is CRITICAL (Confirmed 3rd Time)

**Evidence:**
- v5.9: Emergent 0% → 76% (type fix)
- v5.10: Exchange 0% → 47% (type fix)
- v5.11: Wyrd 0% → 27% (type fix)

**Pattern:** Type fix alone can swing WR by +27% to +76%!

**Action:** Create automated test to prevent lowercase types in future.

### 2. Ossuarium Type Fix Mystery

**Expected:** +20-30% WR
**Actual:** -2% WR

**This needs investigation.** Possibilities:
1. Variance (most likely)
2. Lifesteal not simulating
3. Ossuarium cards fundamentally weak even when usable

**Action:** Extended 1,000-battle simulation to verify.

### 3. Small Sample Size = High Variance

225 battles means:
- Each faction plays ~45 battles (10 factions × 9 matchups ÷ 2)
- WR changes of ±10-15% are NORMAL variance
- Cannot trust single-version results

**Examples of likely variance:**
- Nomads: 76% → 60% (-16%, no changes)
- Exchange: 47% → 60% (+13%, no changes)
- Emergent: 69% → 56% (-13%, no changes)

**Action:** Run extended simulations (500-1000 battles) for reliable data.

### 4. Church Needs Complete Overhaul (Not Tweaks)

**3 versions of incremental nerfs FAILED:**
- v5.9: -1 damage on 7 cards → WR increased
- v5.10: "Ignore Defense" → "Bypass 1-2 Defense" → WR increased
- v5.11: No changes → WR increased again

**Church is not OP because of damage values or specific mechanics.**

**Church is OP because:**
1. 56-card pool (largest in game)
2. "Cannot miss" mechanics still exist
3. Multiple "ignore/bypass Defense" cards
4. Strong reactive cards (0 cost)
5. Spell equipment on top of physical equipment

**Action:** Church needs 50% of card pool nerfed or removed.

### 5. Bottom Tier is Collapsing

**Bottom 4 factions:** 11-27% WR (average: 19%)

**These factions are UNPLAYABLE** in equipment-only mode.

**Root causes:**
1. Small card pools (11 cards each)
2. No "ignore Defense" mechanics
3. Conditional effects that don't work in simulator
4. Low baseline damage (3-4 dmg vs Church's 6-8 dmg)

**Action:** Emergency buffs needed immediately.

---

## Recommended v5.12 Changes

### Priority 1: Nerf Church (93% → 55%)

**Aggressive multi-pronged approach:**

1. **Remove "cannot miss" entirely:**
   - Righteous Wrath: "Cannot miss" → "Advantage (+2 to hit)"
   - Divine Strike: "Auto-hit" → Normal attack

2. **Remove ALL "ignore Defense" and "bypass Defense":**
   - Wild Swing: Remove "bypass 1 Defense"
   - Void Bolt: Remove "bypass 1 Defense"
   - Reality Tear: Remove "bypass 2 Defense"
   - Divine Smite: Remove "ignore Defense"

3. **Damage nerfs on top 15 cards:**
   - Execute: 8 → 6 damage
   - Overhead Smash (Greatsword): 7 → 5 damage
   - Impale: 6 → 5 damage
   - Earthshaker: 5 → 4 damage
   - (Continue for 11 more high-damage cards)

4. **Add SP costs to 0-cost reactive cards:**
   - Quick Deflect: 0 → 1 SP
   - Divine Intervention: 3 → 4 SP
   - (All 0-cost reactives)

**Expected Impact:** -25 to -35% WR

---

### Priority 2: Nerf Bloodlines (80% → 55%)

**Problem:** Over-buffed in v5.10, type fix made worse

**Solution:**

1. **Reduce Biomass payoff damage:**
   - Savage Claw: 7 → 6 damage (spend 3 Biomass)
   - Rending Bite: 7 → 6 damage (spend 2 Biomass)
   - Feral Strike: 6 → 5 damage (spend 2 Biomass)
   - Bloodline Fury: 11 → 8 damage, remove "ignore Defense" (spend 4 Biomass)

2. **Reduce baseline damage:**
   - Alpha's Pounce: 6 → 5 damage
   - Predator's Ambush: 5 → 4 damage

**Expected Impact:** -15 to -20% WR

---

### Priority 3: Nerf Exchange (60% → 50%)

**Problem:** Over-tuned Credit-spending payoffs

**Solution:**

1. **Reduce spending payoff damage by -1:**
   - Contract Blade: 7 → 6 damage (spend 3 Credits)
   - Mercenary Strike: 7 → 6 damage (spend 2 Credits)
   - Calculated Assault: 6 → 5 damage (spend 2 Credits)
   - Hostile Takeover: 10 → 8 damage (spend 4 Credits)

**Expected Impact:** -8 to -10% WR

---

### Priority 4: Buff Wyrd (27% → 45%)

**Problem:** Type fix helped (0% → 27%) but still very weak

**Solution:**

1. **Increase baseline damage by +1-2 across all cards:**
   - Distortion Blade: 3 → 4 damage
   - Void Strike: 3 → 5 damage
   - Reality Rend: 4 → 5 damage
   - Warped Slash: 3 → 4 damage
   - Taint Bolt: 3 → 4 damage
   - Unraveling: 5 → 6 damage

2. **Add "bypass 1 Defense" to 2-3 cards** to help consistency

**Expected Impact:** +15 to +20% WR

---

### Priority 5: Investigate Ossuarium (27% WR)

**Problem:** Type fix expected +20-30% WR, got -2% instead

**Actions:**

1. **Run extended 1,000-battle simulation** to verify if -2% is variance
2. **Verify lifesteal mechanic** works in simulator
3. **If lifesteal broken:** Fix simulator code
4. **If lifesteal works:** Buff Ossuarium damage +2-3 across all cards

**Expected Impact:** +20 to +25% WR (if lifesteal working)

---

### Priority 6: Buff Elves (22% → 45%)

**Problem:** Collapsed from balanced (53%) to weak (22%) in 2 versions

**Solution:**

1. **Increase damage by +2-3 across all cards**
2. **Add "bypass 1 Defense" to 3-5 cards**
3. **Add Thornvine generation** to equipment (if not already present)

**Expected Impact:** +20 to +25% WR

---

### Priority 7: Buff Dwarves (11% → 45%)

**Problem:** Weakest faction, Defense-focused strategy obsolete

**Solution:**

1. **Increase damage by +3-4 across all cards**
2. **Add "ignore Defense on attack" to 5-7 cards:**
   - Armor-Piercing Strike: Add "ignore Defense"
   - Rune Hammer: Add "ignore Defense"
   - etc.
3. **Keep defensive stats unchanged** (leverage their strength)

**Expected Impact:** +30 to +35% WR

---

## Technical Optimizations Applied

### 1. Type Capitalization (DONE ✅)

All 28 lowercase types fixed to capital-case:
- `"attack"` → `"Attack"`
- `"reactive"` → `"Reactive"`
- `"utility"` → `"Utility"`
- `"defense"` → `"Defense"`

### 2. Faction Name Consistency (VERIFIED ✅)

All faction names match simulator expectations:
- `"church"` ✅
- `"crucible"` ✅
- `"dwarves"` ✅
- `"elves"` ✅
- `"emergent"` ✅
- `"exchange"` ✅
- `"nomads"` ✅
- `"ossuarium"` ✅
- `"vestige-bloodlines"` ✅
- `"wyrd-conclave"` ✅

### 3. Database Statistics

```
Total Equipment Items: 55
Total Equipment Cards: 223
Physical Equipment: 112
Spell Equipment: 111
Factions: 10
Support Units: 42
```

All counts verified and consistent.

---

## Conclusion

v5.11 was a **pure technical optimization pass** with ZERO balance changes.

**Success:**
- ✅ Fixed 28 lowercase type bugs
- ✅ Wyrd restored to playable (0% → 27% WR)
- ✅ All type capitalization now correct
- ✅ No redundant code found
- ✅ Faction names verified consistent

**Failure:**
- ❌ Ossuarium type fix didn't help (29% → 27%, variance or deeper issue)
- ❌ Balance score worsened (1/10 → 0/10)
- ❌ Church dominance increased (91% → 93%)
- ❌ Bottom tier collapsed further (Elves/Dwarves at 11-22% WR)

**Key Insight:** Type capitalization bugs cause **catastrophic WR drops** (0-27% WR). This is the 3rd time this pattern has occurred (Emergent v5.9, Exchange v5.10, Wyrd v5.11).

**Next Steps (v5.12):** Aggressive balance changes needed:
1. Church needs complete overhaul (-35% WR target)
2. Bloodlines needs significant nerfs (-20% WR target)
3. Bottom 4 factions need emergency buffs (+20-30% WR each)
4. Ossuarium needs investigation (possible lifesteal bug)
