## Priority Targets

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Fix)

**1. Ossuarium (71% ‚Üí 50-55%)**
- **Problem:** Too tanky, lifesteal too strong in multi-unit
- **Solution:** Reduce HP or nerf lifesteal mechanics

**2. Dwarves (31% ‚Üí 45-50%)**
- **Problem:** Crafting faction cards don't work in combat
- **Solution:** Replace crafting cards with combat-viable alternatives

**3. Nomads (31% ‚Üí 45-50%)**
- **Problem:** Low HP, mobility useless in multi-unit focus fire
- **Solution:** Increase HP on equipment or add defensive faction cards

**4. Elves (36% ‚Üí 45-50%)**
- **Problem:** Bleed damage too weak, attack density diluted
- **Solution:** Increase Bleed damage per stack (1 ‚Üí 2 dmg/turn)

### üü° MODERATE (Should Fix)

**5. Bloodlines (64% ‚Üí 55-60%)**
- **Problem:** Biomass economy too strong
- **Solution:** Increase Biomass spending costs (3 ‚Üí 4 Biomass)

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE (Monitor)

**6. Crucible (58%)**
- Currently in acceptable range (45-65%)
- Monitor after other changes

**7. Wyrd (56%)**
- Currently in acceptable range (45-65%)
- Monitor after other changes

## Detailed Balance Changes

### 1. OSSUARIUM NERFS (71% ‚Üí 50-55%)

**Diagnosis:**
- Highest WR in multi-unit (71%)
- Very tanky (high HP faction cards)
- Lifesteal compounds with multiple units
- Focus fire takes forever to kill them

**Proposed Changes:**

#### Option A: Reduce Base HP (Recommended)
```json
// Reduce HP on high-HP faction cards by 20%
// Example: If faction card adds +5 HP, reduce to +4 HP
// Target: -10-15% effective HP
```

#### Option B: Nerf Lifesteal
```json
// Soul Harvest: "Heal 3 HP" ‚Üí "Heal 2 HP"
// Vampiric Strike: "Heal 50% damage dealt" ‚Üí "Heal 33% damage dealt"
// All lifesteal effects: -33% healing
```

#### Option C: Add Weakness Mechanic
```json
// Add "Curse" debuff to faction cards
// "When damaged, lose 1 additional HP (max 3 per turn)"
// Makes them vulnerable to multi-unit focus fire
```

**Recommendation:** Option B (Nerf Lifesteal by 33%)
- Preserves faction identity
- Reduces multi-unit snowball
- Simpler than adding new mechanics

---

### 2. DWARVES BUFFS (31% ‚Üí 45-50%)

**Diagnosis:**
- Crafting faction cards are NON-FUNCTIONAL in combat simulator
- Cards like "Forge Masterwork" require crafting system not implemented
- 50% of faction cards are dead cards in combat

**Proposed Changes:**

#### Replace Crafting Cards with Combat Cards

**Current (Non-Functional):**
```json
{
  "name": "Forge Masterwork",
  "type": "gambit",
  "cost": 3,
  "effect": "Requires 5 Forge tokens. Create permanent equipment upgrade."
}
```

**New (Combat-Viable):**
```json
{
  "name": "Runic Armor",
  "type": "reactive-defense",
  "cost": 2,
  "defense": 3,
  "effect": "Block 3 damage. Gain +1 Defense for rest of turn."
}
```

**Cards to Replace (10-12 crafting cards):**
1. Forge Masterwork ‚Üí Runic Armor (defense)
2. Craft Runic Weapon ‚Üí Runic Strike (attack)
3. Enchant Equipment ‚Üí Defensive Stance (utility)
4. Master Smith ‚Üí Shield Wall (defensive gambit)
5. Rune Inscription ‚Üí Rune Ward (reactive)

**Target:** Replace all crafting cards with:
- 40% Defensive cards (Dwarves = tank faction)
- 30% Attack cards (Runic damage)
- 30% Utility cards (Buffs, debuffs)

---

### 3. NOMADS BUFFS (31% ‚Üí 45-50%)

**Diagnosis:**
- Mobility useless in multi-unit (can't kite multiple enemies)
- Low HP per unit (likely Scout-heavy armies)
- Focus fire kills them before they can use speed advantage

**Proposed Changes:**

#### Option A: Increase Equipment HP (Recommended)
```json
// Nomad equipment: +20% HP on all items
// Scrap weapons: 10 ‚Üí 12 HP per card
// Target: +15-20% effective HP
```

#### Option B: Add Defensive Faction Cards
```json
{
  "name": "Evasive Maneuvers",
  "type": "reactive-defense",
  "cost": 1,
  "defense": 2,
  "effect": "Block 2 damage. Draw 1 card."
}

{
  "name": "Survivor's Instinct",
  "type": "passive",
  "cost": 0,
  "effect": "When reduced below 10 HP, gain +2 Defense for rest of combat."
}
```

#### Option C: Add "Dodge" Mechanic
```json
{
  "name": "Dodge Roll",
  "type": "reactive-defense",
  "cost": 2,
  "effect": "Negate all damage from next attack. Cannot be used twice in a row."
}
```

**Recommendation:** Option A + Option B
- Increase equipment HP by 20%
- Add 3-4 defensive faction cards (reactive-defense type)
- Preserves mobility theme but adds survivability

---

### 4. ELVES BUFFS (36% ‚Üí 45-50%)

**Diagnosis:**
- Bleed damage too weak (1 dmg/turn per stack)
- Takes 4+ turns of Bleed to equal one attack
- Attack density diluted by faction cards (movement, utilities)
- Bleed stacks cap at 4 (max 4 dmg/turn)

**Proposed Changes:**

#### Option A: Double Bleed Damage (Recommended)
```json
// ALL Bleed effects: 1 dmg/turn ‚Üí 2 dmg/turn per stack
// Max Bleed (4 stacks): 4 dmg/turn ‚Üí 8 dmg/turn
// Makes Bleed worth the setup time
```

#### Option B: Increase Bleed Cap
```json
// Bleed cap: 4 stacks ‚Üí 6 stacks
// Max damage: 4 dmg/turn ‚Üí 6 dmg/turn
// Allows more scaling
```

#### Option C: Add Bleed to More Cards
```json
// Add "Apply Bleed 1" to 5 faction cards that don't have it
// Increases Bleed application density
```

**Recommendation:** Option A (Double Bleed Damage)
- Simple change (one multiplier)
- Makes Bleed strategy viable
- Still requires setup (not instant damage)
- Expected impact: +10-15% WR

---

### 5. BLOODLINES NERFS (64% ‚Üí 55-60%)

**Diagnosis:**
- Biomass economy too strong in multi-unit
- Can spend Biomass for big effects too often
- Each unit generates Biomass, snowballs quickly

**Proposed Changes:**

#### Option A: Increase Biomass Costs (Recommended)
```json
// ALL Biomass-spending cards: +1 Biomass cost
// "Spend 3 Biomass" ‚Üí "Spend 4 Biomass"
// "Spend 5 Biomass" ‚Üí "Spend 6 Biomass"
// Slows down economy
```

#### Option B: Reduce Biomass Generation
```json
// "Gain 2 Biomass" ‚Üí "Gain 1 Biomass"
// Halves generation rate
```

#### Option C: Add Biomass Cap
```json
// Maximum Biomass: 10 (like Forge cap of 5, but higher)
// Prevents infinite stockpiling
```

**Recommendation:** Option A (Increase Costs by +1)
- Preserves economy feel
- Slows down big plays
- Expected impact: -5-10% WR

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
1. **Dwarves** - Replace crafting cards with combat cards (10-12 cards)
2. **Elves** - Double Bleed damage (simple multiplier change)
3. **Ossuarium** - Reduce lifesteal by 33% (5-7 cards)

### Phase 2: Moderate Fixes (After testing Phase 1)
4. **Nomads** - Increase equipment HP by 20% + add 3 defensive faction cards
5. **Bloodlines** - Increase Biomass costs by +1 (all Biomass-spending cards)

### Phase 3: Monitor (After Phase 1+2)
- Crucible (58%) - May self-balance with other changes
- Wyrd (56%) - Already in acceptable range
- Church (53%) - Perfectly balanced, no changes
- Emergent (53%) - Perfectly balanced, no changes
- Exchange (47%) - Perfectly balanced, no changes

**Expected Balance Score:** 8-10/10 factions in 45-65% WR range (80-100%)

---

## Testing Plan

### Step 1: Implement Phase 1 Changes
- Dwarves: Replace 10-12 crafting cards
- Elves: Double Bleed damage (1 ‚Üí 2 dmg/turn)
- Ossuarium: Reduce lifesteal by 33%

### Step 2: Run v5.15a Test
```bash
python3 faction_balance_MULTIUNIT.py
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Dwarves: 31% ‚Üí 45%
- Elves: 36% ‚Üí 50%
- Ossuarium: 71% ‚Üí 55%
- Other factions: minor shifts due to meta changes

### Step 3: Implement Phase 2 (If Needed)
- Nomads: +20% equipment HP, add defensive cards
- Bloodlines: +1 Biomass costs

### Step 4: Run v5.15b Test
```bash
python3 faction_balance_MULTIUNIT.py
```

**Expected outcome:**
- 8-10/10 factions in 45-65% range
- Balanced meta

## Risks & Considerations

### Risk 1: Over-Nerfing Ossuarium
- **Risk:** 71% ‚Üí 40% (too weak)
- **Mitigation:** Start with -33% lifesteal, can reduce further if needed
- **Fallback:** If too weak, buff HP slightly

### Risk 2: Dwarves Card Replacements Break Faction Identity
- **Risk:** Losing crafting theme entirely
- **Mitigation:** Keep 5-6 crafting cards that have combat effects
- **Example:** "Forge Strike: Deal 5 damage. If you have 3+ Forge tokens, deal 7 instead."

### Risk 3: Elves Become Too Strong
- **Risk:** 36% ‚Üí 60% (overshot)
- **Mitigation:** Test Bleed 1.5√ó first if concerned
- **Fallback:** Can reduce Bleed multiplier to 1.5√ó instead of 2√ó

### Risk 4: Meta Shifts Unpredictably
- **Risk:** Buffing Elves makes Ossuarium stronger (counters them)
- **Mitigation:** Run full 225-battle test after each phase
- **Adjustment:** Make incremental changes, test between phases

---

## Alternative: Targeted Micro-Adjustments

If large changes are too risky, try:

**Ossuarium:** -20% lifesteal (instead of -33%)
**Elves:** Bleed 1 ‚Üí 1.5 dmg/turn (instead of 2√ó)
**Dwarves:** Replace only 6 worst crafting cards (instead of all 12)
**Nomads:** +10% HP (instead of +20%)
**Bloodlines:** Monitor instead of nerf (wait for meta to settle)

**Trade-off:**
- Lower risk of overshooting
- May need 2-3 iterations to reach balance
- Safer approach

---

## Next Step

**Recommendation:** Implement Phase 1 changes:

1. **Dwarves:** Replace crafting cards (I can do this now)
2. **Elves:** Double Bleed damage (quick change)
3. **Ossuarium:** Reduce lifesteal by 33% (5-7 cards)

Then run v5.15a test to see results.

**Shall I proceed with Phase 1 implementation?**
