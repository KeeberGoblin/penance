## Analysis by Faction

### 1. **Church: 13.3% → 53.3% WR (+40%!) - NOW BALANCED**

**Single-Unit:** Worst faction (9th place)
**Multi-Unit:** Perfectly balanced (5th place)

**Why the MASSIVE improvement?**
- **Self-harm gambits less punishing in multi-unit**
  - Single-unit: Self-harm reduces own HP directly
  - Multi-unit: Spread across multiple units, less critical
- **Good base stats shine**
  - Church has solid HP/SP ratios
  - Multi-unit combat rewards base stats more than single-unit
- **Focus fire negates self-harm downside**
  - Enemy focuses damaged units first
  - Self-harmed unit gets targeted, dies first, but others survive

**Conclusion:** Church is BALANCED in multi-unit combat despite being broken in 1v1.

---

### 2. **Nomads: 75.6% → 31.1% WR (-44.5%!) - MASSIVE NERF**

**Single-Unit:** 2nd strongest
**Multi-Unit:** 2nd weakest

**Why the COLLAPSE?**
- **Mobility advantage meaningless**
  - Single-unit: Mobility = kiting = advantage
  - Multi-unit: Focus fire = can't kite multiple enemies
- **Low HP per unit**
  - Nomads likely have many Scouts (low HP, 2 pts each)
  - Focus fire kills Scouts quickly
- **No defensive synergy**
  - Multi-unit combat punishes low HP per unit
  - Nomads have speed over tankiness

**Conclusion:** Nomads are strong 1v1 but terrible in armies.

---

### 3. **Dwarves: 4.4% → 31.1% WR (+26.7%) - STILL WEAK BUT BETTER**

**Single-Unit:** Worst faction (10th place, 4.4% WR!)
**Multi-Unit:** Still weak (9th place, 31.1% WR)

**Why the improvement?**
- **High HP base stats**
  - Dwarves likely have tanky units (Wardens, Vanguards)
  - Multi-unit rewards HP more than single-unit
- **Crafting cards less punishing**
  - In single-unit, dead crafting cards = loss
  - In multi-unit, other units can carry
- **Focus fire helps**
  - Even with bad cards, high HP delays death

**Conclusion:** Dwarves are still broken (crafting cards don't work), but multi-unit combat hides it better.

---

### 4. **Ossuarium: 51.1% → 71.1% WR (+20%) - NOW OP**

**Single-Unit:** Perfectly balanced (6th place)
**Multi-Unit:** Overpowered (1st place)

**Why the spike?**
- **Lifesteal/durability scales with units**
  - More units = more lifesteal procs
  - Multi-unit combat multiplies healing
- **High HP advantage compounded**
  - Ossuarium has tanky faction cards
  - Focus fire takes longer to kill tanky units
- **Graveyard mechanics (if active)**
  - More units dying = more graveyard value

**Conclusion:** Ossuarium is balanced 1v1 but overpowered in armies.

---

### 5. **Crucible: 80.0% → 57.8% WR (-22%) - LESS OP**

**Single-Unit:** Most overpowered (1st place)
**Multi-Unit:** Still strong but closer to balanced (3rd place)

**Why the nerf?**
- **Forge tokens don't stack as well**
  - Single-unit: All Forge tokens on one unit = massive damage
  - Multi-unit: Forge spread across units, less concentrated
- **Focus fire negates Forge scaling**
  - Forge unit gets killed before reaching max stacks
- **Doesn't benefit from army synergy**
  - Crucible is a "solo carry" faction
  - Multi-unit favors team synergy over individual power

**Conclusion:** Crucible is still strong but multi-unit reduces their dominance.

---

### 6. **Exchange: 66.7% → 46.7% WR (-20%) - NOW BALANCED**

**Single-Unit:** Overpowered (4th place)
**Multi-Unit:** Balanced (7th place)

**Why the nerf?**
- **Credit economy doesn't scale with units**
  - Single-unit: All Credits on one unit = big purchases
  - Multi-unit: Credits spread across units, less impact per unit
- **Mercenary mechanics diluted**
  - Exchange benefits from spending Credits on big effects
  - Multi-unit: Can't concentrate economy on one unit

**Conclusion:** Exchange is balanced in multi-unit combat.

---

### 7. **Emergent: 64.4% → 53.3% WR (-11%) - NOW BALANCED**

**Single-Unit:** Overpowered (5th place)
**Multi-Unit:** Balanced (6th place)

**Why the nerf?**
- **Hive-mind bonuses average out**
  - Single-unit: All bonuses stack on one unit
  - Multi-unit: Bonuses spread, less concentrated power
- **Metamorph states don't stack**
  - Can't get super-stacked synergies on one unit

**Conclusion:** Emergent is balanced in multi-unit combat.

---

### 8. **Wyrd: 42.2% → 55.6% WR (+13%) - SLIGHTLY OP**

**Single-Unit:** Underpowered (7th place)
**Multi-Unit:** Slightly overpowered (4th place)

**Why the improvement?**
- **Chaos/random effects benefit from sample size**
  - More units = more random procs = averages out to advantage
- **Wyrd tokens multiply**
  - More units generating Wyrd = more value
- **Unpredictability hurts focus fire**
  - Random effects disrupt enemy targeting

**Conclusion:** Wyrd is weak 1v1 but strong in armies.

---

### 9. **Bloodlines: 73.3% → 64.4% WR (-9%) - STILL OP**

**Single-Unit:** Overpowered (3rd place)
**Multi-Unit:** Still overpowered (2nd place)

**Why still strong?**
- **Biomass economy works in both formats**
  - Scales reasonably in multi-unit
  - Each unit can spend Biomass effectively
- **Mutation mechanics flexible**
  - Works solo or in groups

**Conclusion:** Bloodlines is overpowered in both formats (needs nerfs).

---

### 10. **Elves: 28.9% → 35.6% WR (+7%) - STILL WEAK**

**Single-Unit:** Weak (8th place)
**Multi-Unit:** Still weak (8th place)

**Why minimal change?**
- **Bleed mechanics don't improve with units**
  - Bleed damage is per-target, doesn't stack from multiple sources
  - Focus fire kills units before Bleed stacks
- **Low HP still problematic**
  - Elves likely have Scouts/Wardens (low HP)
  - Focus fire kills them quickly

**Conclusion:** Elves need buffs in both formats (Bleed damage increase).

---

## Key Insights

### 1. **Multi-Unit Combat ≠ Single-Unit Combat**

The balance is **radically different**:
- Church went from worst → balanced
- Nomads went from 2nd best → 2nd worst
- Dwarves went from 4.4% WR → 31% WR

**Lesson:** Games with army composition need separate balance from 1v1 duels.

---

### 2. **Army Composition Matters**

Factions perform differently depending on composition:
- **Tanky armies** (Ossuarium, Church): Better in multi-unit
- **Mobile armies** (Nomads): Worse in multi-unit
- **Solo carry** (Crucible): Worse in multi-unit
- **Scaling factions** (Wyrd, Ossuarium): Better in multi-unit

---

### 3. **Focus Fire Changes Everything**

**In single-unit combat:**
- Mobility = kiting advantage
- High damage = kill before being killed
- Self-harm = direct HP loss

**In multi-unit combat:**
- Mobility = meaningless (can't kite multiple enemies)
- High HP = survives focus fire longer
- Self-harm = spread across units, less punishing

---

### 4. **Base Stats > Mechanics in Multi-Unit**

**Single-Unit:** Mechanics dominate (Forge, Bleed, Credits)
**Multi-Unit:** Base stats dominate (HP, SP, unit count)

**Evidence:**
- Ossuarium (high HP) jumped from 51% → 71%
- Church (good stats, bad mechanics) jumped from 13% → 53%
- Nomads (low HP, good mechanics) fell from 76% → 31%

---

### 5. **Turn Limit Impact**

**Timeouts:** 31/45 matchups (69%!) hit the 30-turn limit

**Why so many timeouts?**
- High HP on both sides
- Reshuffling discard into deck (infinite HP in practice)
- Focus fire spreads damage across units
- Low damage per turn

**Solution needed:**
- Reduce turn limit (30 → 20?)
- OR: Increase damage scaling
- OR: Prevent discard reshuffle (permanent HP loss)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate

1. **Use multi-unit balance** for army-based gameplay
2. **Use single-unit balance** for 1v1 duels
3. **Separate balance patches** for each mode

### Balance Priorities (Multi-Unit)

**Overpowered (need nerfs):**
1. Ossuarium (71% WR) - Reduce HP or lifesteal
2. Bloodlines (64% WR) - Increase Biomass costs
3. Crucible (58% WR) - Already nerfed by format, monitor
4. Wyrd (56% WR) - Slightly over, monitor

**Underpowered (need buffs):**
1. Elves (36% WR) - Buff Bleed damage (2 dmg/turn?)
2. Dwarves (31% WR) - Replace crafting cards with combat cards
3. Nomads (31% WR) - Buff HP or add defensive options

**Balanced (no changes):**
- Church (53% WR) ✅
- Emergent (53% WR) ✅
- Exchange (47% WR) ✅

## Comparison: Single-Unit vs Multi-Unit Balance

| Aspect | Single-Unit | Multi-Unit |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Balanced Factions** | 1/10 (10%) | 3/10 (30%) |
| **Church** | Worst (13%) | Balanced (53%) |
| **Nomads** | 2nd best (76%) | 2nd worst (31%) |
| **Dwarves** | Broken (4%) | Weak (31%) |
| **Ossuarium** | Balanced (51%) | OP (71%) |
| **Crucible** | OP (80%) | Strong (58%) |
| **Favors** | Mechanics, damage, mobility | HP, base stats, tankiness |

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Dual Balance System

Balance separately for:
- **1v1 Duels:** Use single-unit combat balance
- **Army Battles:** Use multi-unit combat balance

**Pros:**
- Accurate balance for both modes
- Honors different playstyles

**Cons:**
- More complex
- Harder to maintain

---

### Option 2: Choose Primary Mode

Focus balance on ONE mode:
- **If 1v1 Duels:** Use v5.14 single-unit balance
- **If Army Battles:** Use v5.14d multi-unit balance

**Pros:**
- Simpler
- Easier to balance

**Cons:**
- One mode will be unbalanced

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Average single-unit and multi-unit results:
- Church: (13% + 53%) / 2 = 33% avg
- Nomads: (76% + 31%) / 2 = 53% avg

**Pros:**
- Both modes somewhat balanced
- Middle ground approach

**Cons:**
- Neither mode perfectly balanced
- Compromise solution

---

## Conclusion

**Multi-unit combat simulator is a BREAKTHROUGH!**

✅ **Implemented:**
- Focus fire targeting (attack strongest)
- Multi-unit army battles (2-4 units per side)
- Army composition variety (Scouts, Wardens, Vanguards, Supports)
- Turn limit (30 turns max)
- 1v1 duel option still available (DiceCombatSimulator)

✅ **Results:**
- 3/10 factions balanced (30% vs 10% in single-unit)
- Church fixed (13% → 53% WR)
- Nomads revealed as weak in armies (76% → 31% WR)
- Separate balance needed for 1v1 vs army modes

**Recommendation:** Maintain both simulators (single-unit for duels, multi-unit for armies) and balance separately based on intended gameplay mode.
