# Casket Classes: Stat Blocks & Playstyles

Every Casket in Penance belongs to one of four **weight classes**, each with different mobility, durability, and tactical roles. Your faction determines your playstyle (vampiric lifesteal, fire dueling, etc.), but your **Casket Class** determines your fundamental capabilities.

## Matchup Analysis

### Scout vs Colossus (Extreme Matchup)

**Scout Advantages:**
- 6 SP vs 3 SP = twice as many actions
- Moves 12 hexes vs 1 hex = infinite kiting potential
- Goes first (+3 initiative) vs goes last (-2 initiative)
- Can dictate all engagements

**Colossus Advantages:**
- 60 HP vs 36 HP = 24 HP advantage (40% more)
- Scout needs 10-12 attacks to kill Colossus
- Colossus only needs 6-7 hits to kill Scout
- If Scout is forced to engage, Colossus wins

**Winner:** Scout if open terrain (kites forever), Colossus if chokepoint or objective-based (Scout must engage).

---

### Warden vs Vanguard (Standard Matchup)

**Warden Advantages:**
- Faster (5 SP, 1 SP/hex) = better repositioning
- Gets initiative slightly more often (1d6 vs 1d6-1)
- More flexible equipment (can swap shield for offense)

**Vanguard Advantages:**
- +8 HP advantage = survives 2-3 more attacks
- 2 Shield slots = layered defense
- 2 Accessory slots = more utility

**Winner:** Skill-based, comes down to positioning and equipment choices.

---

### Matchup Rock-Paper-Scissors

- **Scout beats Vanguard** = Kites, Vanguard too slow to catch
- **Vanguard beats Colossus** = Can actually reach Colossus, trade favorably in brawl
- **Colossus beats Scout** = If Scout is forced to engage (objective scenarios), Colossus survives alpha strike and retaliates

---

---

## Advanced: Multi-Class Warbands

In **Campaign Mode** or **Team Scenarios**, mix classes for synergy:

**Example: Balanced 3-Casket Warband**
- 1 Scout (Verdant Covenant) = Flanker, assassin
- 1 Warden (Dwarven Forge-Guilds) = Frontline anchor
- 1 Vanguard (Ossuarium) = Tank, objective holder

**Example: Defensive 3-Casket Warband**
- 1 Colossus (Exchange) = Artillery, support platform
- 2 Vanguards (Crucible Packs) = Bodyguards, zone control

**Example: Alpha Strike Warband**
- 3 Scouts (Elves, Nomads, Wyrd) = Coordinated assassination squad

---

## Design Notes

### Why 4 Classes?

**Scout** = Glass cannon archetype (high risk, high reward)
**Warden** = Baseline reference point (beginner-friendly)
**Vanguard** = Tank archetype (survivability specialist)
**Colossus** = Extreme specialist (artillery/support)

### HP vs SP vs Movement Trade-Offs

Every class trades survivability for actions or mobility:
- Scout: -24 HP, +1 SP, +0.5 movement
- Warden: Baseline
- Vanguard: +8 HP, -1 SP, -0.5 movement
- Colossus: +16 HP, -2 SP, -1 movement

### Major Wound Thresholds

Prevent alpha strikes from instantly loading opponent's deck with DAMAGED cards:
- Scout: 3+ (fragile, needs careful positioning)
- Warden: 5+ (standard)
- Vanguard: 7+ (hard to wound)
- Colossus: 9+ (nearly immune to Major Wounds)
