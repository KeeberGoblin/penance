# Playing as a Support Unit (Alternative Gameplay Mode)

**"Always a chance."**

In standard Penance, you pilot a Casket - a 10-ton war machine. But what if you're the **underdog**? What if you're the scrappy support unit who refuses to die?

This optional ruleset allows you to **play as a Support Unit** instead of a Casket, creating asymmetric "David vs Goliath" gameplay.

---

## Core Philosophy

Support units are:
- **Fragile but fierce** - Low HP but high mobility/damage
- **Guerrilla fighters** - Hit-and-run, ambush, evasion
- **Underdogs** - Always the underdog, always fighting uphill
- **High skill ceiling** - Mistakes are punished, but mastery is rewarding

---

## Character Creation (Support Unit Main)

### Step 1: Choose Your Support Unit

Instead of choosing a Casket class, select any Support Unit from your faction's roster.

**Example Support Units:**
- **Church**: Flagellant Pack, Penitent Squad, Honor Guard
- **Ossuarium**: Bone Swarm, Wraith Stalker, Crypt Guardian
- **Elves**: Moonblade Scout, Sylvan Ranger, Treant Sentinel
- *(See complete list in card database: 39 support units total)*

### Step 2: Apply Main Character Stats

When playing a support unit as your main character, apply these modifications:

| Stat | Base (NPC) | Main Character | Multiplier |
|------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **HP** | 6-12 | 24-48 | ×4 |
| **Movement** | 3-5 hexes | Unchanged | ×1 |
| **Defense** | 0-2 | Unchanged | ×1 |
| **Equipment Slots** | 2 | 2 | ×1 |
| **SP per Turn** | N/A | 5 SP | NEW |
| **Deck Size** | N/A | 20 cards | NEW |

**Example**: Flagellant Pack
- NPC Stats: 6 HP, 4 Movement, 0 Defense
- Main Character Stats: **24 HP**, 4 Movement, 0 Defense, 5 SP, 20-card deck

### Step 3: Build Your Deck

**Deck Composition (20 cards total):**

1. **Behavior Cards (6 cards)**: Choose 6 cards from your support unit's original Behavior deck
   - These become playable cards (you control them, not AI)
   - Keep original costs/effects

2. **Faction Equipment (10 cards)**: Choose from your faction's equipment pool
   - Same options as Caskets
   - Limited to 2 equipment slots (cannot change mid-battle)

3. **Universal Cards (4 cards)**: Standard universal options
   - Desperate Lunge, Heat Vent, Emergency Repair, etc.

**Deck Building Rules:**
- Maximum 3 copies of any card
- Must include at least 6 Behavior cards (your unit's signature moves)
- Can include faction cards if support unit belongs to that faction

### Step 4: Equipment Loadout

Support units have **2 equipment slots**:
- 1 Weapon slot
- 1 Accessory/Armor slot

Unlike Caskets, support units **cannot change equipment mid-battle**. Choose wisely.

## Combat Rules (Support Unit Main)

### Resource Management

**SP System:**
- Gain **5 SP per turn** (same as Warden Casket)
- Spend SP on cards, movement, and actions
- Movement costs **1 SP per hex** (standard rate)

**Heat System:**
- Support units generate Heat normally
- **Heat Threshold: 4** (lower than Caskets!)
- At 5+ Heat, roll Strain checks as normal

**Deck = HP:**
- Your 20-card deck represents HP
- Each card lost = HP lost
- When deck reaches 0, you are defeated

### Damage & Durability

**No Component Damage:**
- Support units don't have components (Head/Arms/Chassis/Legs)
- All damage goes directly to HP deck
- No DAMAGED cards or component penalties
- Simpler damage resolution

**Major Wound Threshold:**
- Scout Support Units: **2+ damage** = Major Wound
- Warden Support Units: **3+ damage** = Major Wound
- Vanguard Support Units: **4+ damage** = Major Wound
- Colossus Support Units: **5+ damage** = Major Wound

*(Support units are categorized by their original HP/role)*

**Major Wounds:**
- Add 1 DAMAGED card to deck per Major Wound
- DAMAGED cards have negative effects when drawn
- Standard rules apply

### Movement & Positioning

**Movement Advantages:**
- Support units are smaller = **Can move through friendly units**
- Support units are agile = **Can stand up from prone for 1 SP** (Caskets: 2 SP)
- Support units are sneaky = **+1 Defense when in cover**

**Movement Disadvantages:**
- Support units are light = **Knockback effects push +1 hex**
- Support units are fragile = **Difficult terrain costs +1 SP per hex**

---

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Play Support Units

**Good Matchups:**
- vs Slow Caskets (Colossus, Vanguard) - Kite and harass
- vs Melee-focused builds - Stay at range
- vs Low-damage builds - Your Defense matters more

**Bad Matchups:**
- vs Scout Caskets - They're faster AND tankier
- vs AoE damage - No components to distribute damage
- vs Multi-attack builds - Each hit threatens Major Wounds

### Tactical Advantages

1. **Mobility** - Outmaneuver slower Caskets
2. **Surprise Factor** - Opponents underestimate you
3. **Action Economy** - 5 SP = same actions as Warden
4. **Simplicity** - No component tracking, faster gameplay

### Tactical Disadvantages

1. **Fragility** - 24 HP vs 36-60 HP (you die in 4-6 hits)
2. **Limited Equipment** - Only 2 slots vs Caskets' 3
3. **Low Heat Tolerance** - 4 Heat threshold vs 5
4. **No Pilot Wounds** - Can't absorb extra damage via Pilot Wound deck

## Design Notes

### Why Play Support Units?

1. **Challenge** - High skill ceiling, rewarding mastery
2. **Asymmetry** - Unique gameplay vs standard Casket matches
3. **Roleplay** - Be the scrappy underdog hero
4. **Speed** - Simpler rules = faster games
5. **Variety** - 39 support units = tons of options

### Balance Philosophy

Support units are **intentionally weaker** than Caskets. This is a feature, not a bug.

- Caskets are 10-ton war machines
- Support units are infantry/creatures
- **If you win as a support unit, you EARNED it**

This ruleset is for players who want:
- Hard mode
- Underdog fantasy
- Asymmetric gameplay
- Bragging rights

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can support units use faction cards (like Blood Offering)?**
A: Yes, if they belong to that faction. Flagellant Pack can use Church faction cards.

**Q: Do support units have component damage?**
A: No. All damage goes to HP deck. Simpler system.

**Q: Can I bring multiple support units as mains?**
A: Yes! You could play 3 support units vs 1 Casket. Discuss with your opponent.

**Q: What happens if my support unit reaches 0 HP?**
A: You lose, same as Caskets. Deck = HP.

**Q: Can support units use equipment with "Casket only" restrictions?**
A: No. Stick to universal/faction equipment without restrictions.

**Q: Do behavior cards still have priority/AI logic?**
A: No. When used as main character, YOU choose when to play them. Priority is just flavor text.
