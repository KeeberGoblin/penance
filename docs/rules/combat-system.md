# Combat & Damage System (GKR + KDM Hybrid)
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Version**: 2.0 Base Rules (October 10, 2025)
**v3.0 Enhancements**: Optional [Dice Pool Advantage](dice-pool-advantage.md) and [Taint Exploitation](taint-exploitation.md) available

---

## Core Concept: Dual-Layer Damage

Inspired by **GKR: Heavy Hitters** (deck-as-HP) + **Kingdom Death: Monster** (brutal consequences)

**Two Separate Systems**:
1. **Casket HP Deck** (30 cards) - Your mech's structural integrity
2. **Pilot Wound Deck** (10 cards) - Your pilot's physical/mental state

When **Casket HP Deck runs out** → Casket is destroyed (pilot may survive)
When **Pilot Wound Deck runs out** → Pilot dies (Casket becomes inert)

---

## 1. Casket HP Deck (Variable Size)

### Deck Composition (GKR-Style + v2.0 Modular Equipment)

Your deck represents your Casket's HP. Every card you discard = damage taken.

**v2.0 Variable Deck System** (26-50 cards depending on equipment):
- **10 Universal Cards** (mandatory, everyone has these)
- **6 Faction Core Cards** (faction-specific foundation)
- **Equipment Cards** (variable 3-30 cards: Weapon + Shield/Offhand + Accessories)
- **2 Faction Tactic Cards** (chosen from 5 available, pick 2 before battle)

**Total: 26-50 cards** (Light Caskets ~26-32, Heavy Caskets ~38-50)

> **NOTE**: This section shows **simplified v1.0 example** for teaching. See [deck-equipment-system.md](../factions/church/deck-equipment-system.md) for full v2.0 modular equipment.

---

### Universal Core (10 Cards)

Everyone has these 10 cards (basic movement, defense, utility):

| Card Name | Type | SP Cost | Effect |
|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| **Desperate Lunge** | Movement | 1 | Move up to 2 hexes |
| **Brace for Impact** | Defense (Reactive) | 0 | Reduce next damage by 2 |
| **Emergency Vent** | Heat Management | 2 | Remove 3 Heat |
| **Sensor Sweep** | Utility | 1 | Reveal 1 enemy card in hand |
| **Overextend** | Movement | 1 | Move 3 hexes, gain 1 Heat |
| **Rally Cry** | Support | 2 | Ally within 3 hexes draws 1 card |
| **Survey the Field** | Utility | 1 | Draw 1 card |
| **Feint** | Combat | 1 | Next attack this turn: +1 damage |
| **Retreat** | Movement | 2 | Move 4 hexes, cannot attack this turn |
| **Breathe the Core** | Heat Management | 1 | Remove 1 Heat, draw 1 card |

---

### Primary Weapon Cards (12 Cards)

**Faction-specific, defines your playstyle.**

This is your **main weapon system** built into the Casket. Cannot be changed mid-campaign (it's part of the Casket chassis).

**Example: Church Confessor - "Penitent Blades"** (12 cards)

| Card Name | SP Cost | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Blood Offering** × 2 | 0 | Discard 2 cards (self-harm). Next attack: +3 damage, ignore 1 Armor |
| **Faithful Thrust** × 3 | 2 | Deal 4 damage. Rear attack: +2 damage |
| **Righteous Cleave** × 2 | 3 | Deal 5 damage to primary target, 2 damage to adjacent enemy |
| **Martyrdom Protocol** × 2 | 1 | Redirect 1 attack targeting ally to yourself this round |
| **Divine Judgment** × 2 | 4 | If target has 10 or fewer cards in deck, deal 8 damage |
| **Consecrated Ground** × 1 | 3 | Create healing zone (3-hex radius). Allies recover 2 cards/turn |

**Design Notes**:
- Some cards have **multiple copies** (Faithful Thrust × 3 = you can draw it more often)
- Mix of offense, utility, and self-sacrifice
- Total: 12 cards

---

### Secondary Weapon/Equipment Cards (6 Cards)

**Customizable loadout** chosen during deck construction.

Choose ONE of the following equipment sets (each adds 6 cards):

**Option A: Buckler Shield**
- Deflect × 2 (Reactive, 0 SP: Reduce damage by 1)
- Bash × 2 (1 SP: Deal 2 damage, push 1 hex)
- Hunker Down × 2 (2 SP: +2 Defense this round)

**Option B: Tower Shield**
- Wall of Iron × 2 (Reactive, 0 SP: Reduce damage by 3, gain 1 Heat)
- Shield Wall × 2 (3 SP: Allies behind you get +2 Defense)
- Advance × 2 (2 SP: Move 2 hexes, Defense +1 this turn)

**Option C: Repair Kit (Relic)**
- Emergency Repair × 2 (2 SP: Recover 3 cards from discard)
- Scrap Armor × 2 (1 SP: Gain 1 Armor until damaged)
- Jury-Rig × 2 (3 SP: Shuffle discard into deck, do not add Damage card)

**Option D: Secondary Weapon (Pistol)**
- Quick Shot × 3 (1 SP: Deal 2 damage, Range 3)
- Dual Wield × 2 (2 SP: Deal 3 damage, then discard 1 card)
- Suppressing Fire × 1 (3 SP: Deal 2 damage to up to 3 targets)

---

### Faction Tactic Cards (2 Cards)

**Choose 2 from 5 available before each battle** (GKR-style deck customization).

**Example: Church of Absolution Tactics**

Available pool (choose 2):
1. **Blood Offering** (already in Primary, don't duplicate)
2. **Righteous Fury** (Passive: Each enemy killed this mission: +1 permanent damage)
3. **Martyrdom Protocol** (already in Primary, don't duplicate)
4. **Divine Judgment** (already in Primary, don't duplicate)
5. **Flagellant's Zeal** (Once per mission: Discard 5 cards, gain 5 SP immediately)

Wait, this creates duplication issues. Let me revise:

**Faction Tactics are UNIQUE cards not in Primary weapon.**

**Church Tactics** (choose 2 from 5):
1. **Righteous Fury** (Passive: Each kill: +1 damage to all attacks permanently this mission)
2. **Flagellant's Zeal** (4 SP: Discard 5 cards, gain 5 SP immediately)
3. **Last Rites** (0 SP, Reactive: When ally is defeated, recover 5 cards)
4. **Absolution** (5 SP: Remove all Heat, recover 3 cards, gain 1 Taint)
5. **Crusader's Vow** (Passive: While above 20 cards in deck, -1 SP to all attacks)

---

## 2. Attack Resolution (To-Hit System)

### Step 1: Declare Attack

**Attacker declares**:
1. Target enemy
2. Which attack card to play (sets base damage)
3. Which component to target (Right Arm, Left Arm, Legs, Head, Chassis, or Random)
4. Range and facing

---

### Step 2: Calculate To-Hit Number

**Base To-Hit**: **5+** (roll 2d6 Attack Dice, need 5+ total)

> **v3.0 OPTIONAL**: Instead of static modifiers (+1/+2), use [Dice Pool Advantage](dice-pool-advantage.md) system. Roll 3d6 take 2 highest (Advantage) or 3d6 take 2 lowest (Disadvantage). See quick-reference.md for conversion table.

**Apply ALL applicable modifiers**:

#### Range Modifiers
- **Short Range (0-3 hexes)**: +0
- **Medium Range (4-6 hexes)**: +1 to target number (need 6+)
- **Long Range (7-10 hexes)**: +2 to target number (need 7+)
- **Extreme Range (11+ hexes)**: +3 to target number (need 8+)

#### Attacker Movement (This Turn)
- **Stationary (0 hexes moved)**: +0
- **Moved 1-3 hexes**: +1
- **Moved 4-6 hexes**: +2
- **Sprinted (7+ hexes)**: +3

#### Defender Movement (Last Turn)
- **Stationary**: +0
- **Moved 1-3 hexes**: +1
- **Moved 4-6 hexes**: +2
- **Sprinted (7+ hexes)**: +3

#### Hex-Side Facing
- **Front Arc (Hex 1)**: +0
- **Weapon-Side (Hex 2)**: +0 (but +1 damage if hit)
- **Flanks (Hex 3, 5)**: -1 (easier, need 4+)
- **Rear (Hex 4)**: -2 (easier, need 3+)
- **Shield-Side (Hex 6)**: +1 (harder, need 6+)

#### Terrain Modifiers
- **Light Cover** (rubble, low walls): +1
- **Heavy Cover** (fortress walls, forest): +2
- **Obscured** (smoke, darkness): +2
- **Elevated** (attacker on high ground): -1 (easier)

**Example**:
- Base: 5+
- Medium range: +1 (need 6+)
- Attacker moved 4 hexes: +1 (need 7+)
- Defender moved 2 hexes: +1 (need 8+)
- Shield-side facing: +1 (need **9+**)

---

### Step 3: Roll Attack Dice

**Roll 2d6 Attack Dice** (custom dice with symbols):

#### Attack Die Faces
| Symbol | Value | Name |
|--------|-------|------|
| | 3 | STRIKE |
| | 4 | DOUBLE STRIKE |
| | 5 | DEATH BLOW |
| | 1 | GLANCE |
| | 0 | JAM |
| | 2 | BLOOD |

**Add both dice results, compare to target number**:

#### Hit Results
- **5-6 total** = **Hit** (standard damage)
- **7-8 total** = **Strong Hit** (standard damage +1)
- **9-10 total** = **Critical Hit** (standard damage +2, bypass 1 Defense)
- **10 (double )** = **EXECUTION** (auto-destroy 1 Component, bypass ALL Defense)

#### Miss Results
- **Below target number** = **MISS** (no damage, attack wasted)
- **2 (double )** = **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**:
 - Weapon jams (discard all Primary Weapon cards from hand)
 - +2 Heat (weapon overload)
 - Next attack -2 damage (weapon damaged)

---

### Step 4: Roll Defense Dice (If Hit)

**If attack hits, Defender rolls Defense Dice**:

**Roll 1d6 Defense Die per damage point**

#### Defense Die Faces
| Symbol | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **SHIELD** | Block 1 damage |
| **ABSORB** | Block 1 damage |
| **FLESH WOUND** | Take damage (discard 1 card) |
| **CRITICAL** | Take damage + 1 Component Damage |
| **PIERCE** | Take damage, cannot use reactive cards |
| **HEAT** | Take damage + 1 Heat |

**Count results**:
1. Count **SHIELD** () and **ABSORB** () symbols → Reduce damage by this amount
2. Apply special effects from **CRITICAL** (), **PIERCE** (), **HEAT** ()
3. Final damage = Original damage - Blocks

**Example**: Take 6 damage → Roll 6 Defense Dice
- Result: 
- **2 blocks** = Reduce to 4 damage
- **1 Critical** () = +1 Component Damage
- **1 Heat** () = +1 Heat
- **1 Pierce** () = Cannot use reactive defense cards
- **Final**: Discard 4 cards + 1 Component Damage + 1 Heat

---

### Step 5: Apply Damage (GKR-Style Choice)

**Defender chooses how to discard cards**:

- **From Hand**: Lose tactical options but control what's lost
- **From Deck**: Keep hand intact but risk losing key cards randomly
- **Mixed**: Discard some from hand, some from deck

**Example**: Take 5 damage → Discard 3 from hand + 2 from deck top

**Strategic Depth**: Do you burn your hand to avoid Component Damage? Or keep cards and risk it?

---

### Step 6: Check for Component Damage

**If you discarded any Primary Weapon equipment cards**:
- Mark 1 Component Damage per Primary Weapon card to targeted component
- Track separately: Right Arm, Left Arm, Legs, Head, Chassis
- **3 Component Damage = Component DESTROYED**

**If Defense Dice showed CRITICAL symbols ()**:
- Add +1 Component Damage per symbol to targeted component

> **v2.0 NOTE**: "Primary Weapon cards" refers to your equipped weapon cards (e.g., Longsword, Greatsword, Pistol). These are the cards you discarded from your Primary Weapon slot equipment.

## 3. Component Damage (KDM-Style Brutality)

### Tracking Component Damage

**5 Component Locations**:
- **Right Arm** (Primary Weapon)
- **Left Arm** (Secondary Equipment)
- **Legs** (Movement)
- **Head** (Sensors)
- **Chassis** (Core)

**How it accumulates**:
1. Attacker declares which component to target (or roll 1d6 if random)
2. When Primary Weapon cards are discarded from damage → 1 Component Damage per card
3. When Defense Dice show CRITICAL → +1 Component Damage
4. **3 Component Damage to same location = Component DESTROYED**

**Example**:
- Enemy attacks your Right Arm for 6 damage
- Roll 6 Defense Dice: 
- **2 Shield blocks** = Reduce to 4 damage
- **2 Critical symbols** = +2 Component Damage to Right Arm
- You choose to discard 2 from hand (both Primary Weapon cards) + 2 from deck
- **Total**: 2 Component Damage (from discarded Primary cards) + 2 (from symbols) = **4 Component Damage**
- Right Arm has **EXCEEDED 3** → **Right Arm DESTROYED**

---

### Component Destroyed Effects

**Right Arm Destroyed**:
- Discard all Primary Weapon cards from hand immediately
- Cannot play Primary Weapon cards for rest of battle
- Must rely on Universal Core + Secondary Equipment only

**Left Arm Destroyed**:
- Discard all Secondary Equipment cards from hand
- Cannot use shield reactive cards or offhand weapons

**Legs Destroyed**:
- Movement costs **+1 SP per hex**
- Cannot Sprint (max 3 hexes/turn even with Sprint cards)

**Head Destroyed**:
- Cannot use Sensor Sweep or targeting cards
- **-1 to all ranged attacks** (penalties stack with to-hit modifiers)

**Chassis Destroyed**:
- **Permanent -1 SP maximum** (Light 6 → 5, Heavy 4 → 3, etc.)
- -1 Defense against all attacks

## 4. Deck Depletion (Running Out of HP)

**When your deck runs out mid-turn**:
- Continue taking damage by discarding from **discard pile**
- If discard pile is empty, you're **Defeated**

**When you would draw a card but deck is empty**:
- **Reshuffle Trigger** (like GKR, but with KDM twist)
- Shuffle discard pile into new deck
- **Add 1 "Damage" card** to the deck (permanent degradation)
- Draw normally

**Damage Cards** (KDM-Style):
- Dead draws (do nothing when played)
- Dilute your deck over time
- Make it harder to draw useful cards
- After 3-4 reshuffles, deck is 30% Damage cards → death spiral

---

## 5. Pilot Wound Deck (10 Cards)

### Separate from Casket HP

**The Pilot has their own 10-card Wound Deck.**

This represents pilot physical/mental state inside the capsule.

**Starting Wound Deck** (10 cards, all face-down):

| Card | Quantity | Type |
|------|----------|------|
| **Minor Injury** | 5 | Recoverable |
| **Severe Injury** | 3 | Permanent effect |
| **Trauma** | 2 | Mental breakdown |

---

### When Pilot Takes Damage

**Pilots take damage separately from Casket in these situations**:

1. **Capsule Breach** (enemy specifically targets capsule, rare)
2. **Neural Feedback** (when 5+ Component Damage accumulated)
3. **Thread Snap** (when Hand Threads break from damage)
4. **Taint Overload** (when Taint reaches 10+, roll Corruption Save)
5. **Casket Destruction** (when Casket HP deck runs out, pilot must save)

> **v3.0 OPTIONAL**: Use [Taint Exploitation](taint-exploitation.md) to spend Taint tactically (offensive debuffs, defensive power-ups). Taint becomes a resource, not just a threshold.

**When Pilot takes damage**:
- Flip 1 Wound Card face-up per damage
- Read effect immediately
- Card remains face-up (permanent)

> **v3.0 OPTIONAL**: Roll 1d6 + [Pilot Grit](../campaigns/pilot-grit-system.md) to resist Wound. On 5+, ignore 1 Wound. Veterans (Grit 2-3) are mechanically tougher.

---

### Wound Card Effects

**Minor Injury** (5 cards):
1. **Concussion**: -1 to all SP until end of mission
2. **Broken Finger**: Cannot use 1 specific card type (roll d10 for which finger/thread)
3. **Internal Bleeding**: At start of each round, discard 1 card from Casket deck
4. **Dislocated Shoulder**: -2 damage to all attacks until end of mission
5. **Cracked Rib**: Each time you gain Heat, gain +1 additional Heat

**Severe Injury** (3 cards):
1. **Shattered Hand**: Permanently lose 2 Neural Threads. -2 SP maximum (PERMANENT, even after mission)
2. **Spinal Trauma**: Movement costs +1 SP per hex (PERMANENT)
3. **Ruptured Organ**: Start each mission at -5 Casket HP (discard 5 cards at deployment)

**Trauma** (2 cards):
1. **PTSD**: Cannot attack enemies from behind (triggers panic)
2. **Dissociation**: At start of each turn, roll 1d6. On 1-2, lose 1 SP this turn (pilot zones out)

---

### Pilot Death

**If all 10 Wound Cards are face-up → Pilot Dies**

- Casket becomes inert (stops moving)
- Pilot must be extracted (if allies present)
- Campaign: Pilot is dead, roll new character
- Arena: Match loss

---

## 6. Suffering Dice (Church & Event System)

**For Church of Absolution and brutal campaign events**, use **Suffering Dice (d6)** for self-harm mechanics:

### Suffering Die Faces

| Symbol | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **BLOOD PRICE** | Discard 2 cards (self-harm) |
| **MARTYRDOM** | Discard 3 cards, +3 damage to next attack |
| **ZEALOT'S FURY** | Discard 1 card, +1 damage to all attacks this turn |
| **DIVINE MERCY** | No self-harm |
| **PENANCE** | Discard 1 card, +1 Heat, +2 damage next attack |
| **ABSOLUTION** | Discard 1 card, recover 1 card from discard |

### When to Roll Suffering Dice

**Church Faction Abilities**:
- **BLOOD OFFERING** card: Instead of auto-discarding 2 cards, roll 1 Suffering Die
- **Flagellant's Zeal** Tactic: Roll 2 Suffering Dice, apply both effects
- **Martyrdom Protocol**: When redirecting damage, roll 1 Suffering Die per 3 damage redirected

**Campaign Events**:
- **Penance Rituals** (settlement events)
- **Taint Purging** (when Taint reaches 8+)
- **Soul Bargains** (desperate deals with Bonelord Thresh)

---

## 7. SP Economy (Energy System)

### SP by Frame Type

Following GKR's energy economy, but adapted to Penance's weight classes:

| Casket Type | SP Maximum | Deck Size | Philosophy |
|-------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Light** | 6 SP | 30 cards | Speed & efficiency |
| **Medium** | 5 SP | 30 cards | Balanced |
| **Heavy** | 4 SP | 30 cards | Endurance |
| **Assault** | 3 SP | 30 cards | Power over finesse |

**Why decreasing SP for heavier frames?**
- Heavy Caskets are slower, less energy-efficient
- Forces different playstyles (Light = many small actions, Assault = few powerful actions)
- Balances high armor/HP with lower action economy

---

### SP Refresh

**At start of your turn**:
- Restore SP to maximum
- Exception: If in **Danger Zone** (5+ Heat), roll Strain first

**SP costs examples**:
- Movement: 1 SP per hex
- Attacks: 1-5 SP (varies by card)
- Reactive defense: 0 SP (interrupt opponent's turn)
- Utility: 1-3 SP

---

### Heat System (Limits SP)

**Heat replaces GKR's "Energy drain" mechanic.**

**Heat Zones**:
- **Safe Zone** (0-4 Heat): No penalties
- **Danger Zone** (5+ Heat): Roll Strain at start of turn
- **Critical** (10+ Heat): Automatic system failures

**Strain Roll** (1d6 + Heat):
- 1-5: Gain 1 Heat
- 6-8: Lose 1 SP this turn
- 9-11: Take 2 damage (discard 2 cards)
- 12+: Component malfunction (lose 1 random Component)

**Heat Management**:
- Vent actively (Emergency Vent card, Breathe the Core)
- Stand in water hexes (remove 2 Heat/turn)
- Pass your turn (remove 1 Heat)

---

## 8. Card Draw & Hand Management

### Starting Hand: 6 Cards

**At start of battle**:
- Shuffle 30-card deck
- Draw 6 cards
- Mulligan: May shuffle hand back and draw 6 new cards (once)

### Drawing Cards

**Draw Phase** (end of your turn):
- Draw until hand = 6 cards
- If deck empty, trigger Reshuffle (add 1 Damage card)

**Mid-Turn Draw**:
- Some cards have "Draw 1 card" effect
- Draw immediately from deck

---

## 9. Victory Conditions

### Arena/Skirmish

**Win by**:
- Reducing enemy Casket to 0 HP (deck empty + discard empty)
- Killing enemy pilot (10 Wounds)
- Enemy surrenders

**Defeat**:
- Your Casket destroyed
- Your pilot dies
- You surrender

### Campaign

**Mission Success**:
- Achieve primary objective
- At least 1 pilot survives

**Partial Success**:
- Primary objective failed
- But pilots survived (can retreat)

**Mission Failure**:
- All pilots dead or captured

---

## 10. Deck Construction Summary

### Template: Church Confessor (Light Casket)

**Total Deck: 30 cards**

1. **Universal Core** (10 cards) - MANDATORY
 - Desperate Lunge, Brace for Impact, Emergency Vent, Sensor Sweep, Overextend, Rally Cry, Survey the Field, Feint, Retreat, Breathe the Core

2. **Primary Weapon: Penitent Blades** (12 cards) - FACTION-SPECIFIC
 - Blood Offering × 2
 - Faithful Thrust × 3
 - Righteous Cleave × 2
 - Martyrdom Protocol × 2
 - Divine Judgment × 2
 - Consecrated Ground × 1

3. **Secondary Equipment: Buckler Shield** (6 cards) - PLAYER CHOICE
 - Deflect × 2
 - Bash × 2
 - Hunker Down × 2

4. **Faction Tactics** (2 cards) - CHOOSE 2 FROM 5
 - Righteous Fury
 - Flagellant's Zeal

**SP Maximum**: 6 (Light Casket)
**Pilot Wound Deck**: 10 cards (separate)

---

## 11. Differences from Standard Deck-Builders

### Like GKR:
- ✅ Deck = HP (discard cards when damaged)
- ✅ Energy/SP refresh each turn
- ✅ Primary vs Secondary weapon split
- ✅ Deck is fixed 30 cards (no mid-game deck-building)
- ✅ Hand size fixed at 6

### Like KDM:
- ✅ Component damage tracking (arms, legs, head destroyed)
- ✅ Permanent injuries (Pilot Wound deck)
- ✅ Death spiral (Damage cards added to deck on reshuffle)
- ✅ Brutal consequences (losing Primary Weapon cards = component damage)

### Unique to Penance:
- Heat system (risk/reward pushing into Danger Zone)
- Pilot Wound deck (separate from Casket HP)
- Neural Thread damage (pilot takes damage when components destroyed)
- Asymmetric factions (Primary Weapon cards completely different per faction)

---

## 12. Example Combat Sequence (With Dice)

### Setup:
- **Player A**: Church Confessor (30 HP, 6 SP, 6 cards in hand)
- **Player B**: Dwarven Ironclad (30 HP, 4 SP, 6 cards in hand)

---

### Round 1

**Player A Turn** (Confessor):
1. Refresh to 6 SP
2. Play **Desperate Lunge** (1 SP) → Move 2 hexes toward enemy (total moved: 2 hexes)
3. Play **Faithful Thrust** (2 SP) → Declare attack for 4 damage, Range: Melee
 - **To-Hit Calculation**: Base 5+ | Moved 2 hexes +1 | Front arc +0 = **Need 6+**
 - **Attack Roll**: (3) + (4) = **7 total** → **STRONG HIT** (+1 damage)
 - Final damage: 4 base + 1 (Strong Hit) = **5 damage**
4. Player B rolls **5 Defense Dice**: 
 - **1 Shield block** → Reduce to 4 damage
 - **1 Critical ()** → +1 Component Damage to Right Arm
 - **1 Heat ()** → +1 Heat
5. Player B discards 4 cards (chooses: 2 from hand, 2 from deck)
 - Discarded from hand: 1× Primary Weapon card → +1 Component Damage
 - **Total Component Damage to Right Arm: 2** (1 from , 1 from Primary card)
6. Player A has 3 SP remaining → Passes
7. Draw Phase: Draw 2 cards (hand back to 6)

**Player B Turn** (Ironclad):
1. Refresh to 4 SP, currently at 1 Heat (safe)
2. Play **Advance** (2 SP) → Move 2 hexes toward enemy
3. Play **Hammer Strike** (3 SP) → Declare attack for 6 damage, ignore 1 Armor
 - **To-Hit Calculation**: Base 5+ | Moved 2 hexes +1 | Attacking front +0 = **Need 6+**
 - **Attack Roll**: (5) + (3) = **8 total** → **STRONG HIT** (+1 damage)
 - Final damage: 6 base + 1 (Strong Hit) = **7 damage**
4. Player A rolls **7 Defense Dice**: 
 - **1 Shield block** → Reduce to 6 damage
 - **2 Critical ()** → +2 Component Damage to Right Arm
 - **1 Heat ()** → +1 Heat
 - **1 Pierce ()** → Cannot use reactive defense cards
5. Player A discards 6 cards (chooses: 3 from hand, 3 from deck)
 - Discarded from hand: 2× Primary Weapon (Penitent Blades) → +2 Component Damage
 - **Total Component Damage to Right Arm**: 2 (from ) + 2 (from Primary cards) = **4 Component Damage**
 - Right Arm has **EXCEEDED 3** → **RIGHT ARM DESTROYED!**
 - Player A discards all remaining Penitent Blade cards from hand (cannot use Primary Weapon)
6. Player B has 0 SP → Turn ends
7. Draw Phase: Draw 3 cards

---

### Round 2

**Player A Turn**:
- Now has NO Primary Weapon cards in hand (all discarded)
- Must rely on Universal cards + Secondary Equipment (Buckler)
- Desperate situation → Might use **Blood Offering** (discard 2 cards for +3 damage boost)

---

This creates **brutal, desperate combat** where Component Damage matters and losing your Primary Weapon mid-fight is catastrophic.

**END OF DOCUMENT**

*"Your deck is your life. Every card you lose brings you closer to death. When your Primary Weapon cards are gone, you're just a broken puppet swinging fists in the dark."*
