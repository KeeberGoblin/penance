## Version 3.0 Optional Rules (Advanced Mechanics)

**New in v3.0**: Three advanced mechanics systems for enhanced tactical depth.

### [Dice Pool Advantage](dice-pool-advantage.md)
Replace static modifiers with roll-more-dice system. Advantage = 3d6 take 2 highest. More dramatic crits and god rolls!

### [Taint Exploitation](taint-exploitation.md)
Make Taint a tactical resource. Spend enemy Taint offensively (force rerolls, gain Advantage). Spend your own Taint for desperate power.

### [Pilot Grit System](../campaigns/pilot-grit-system.md)
Campaign stat (0-3) that grows with survival. Roll 1d6 + Grit to resist Pilot Wounds. Veterans are mechanically tougher.

## Key Concepts

**Deck-as-HP**: Your deck (typically 26–50 cards) is your HP. Discard cards when damaged.

**Component Damage**: Discard 3 Primary Weapon cards from damage = component destroyed = permanent effect.

**SP Economy**: Play multiple cards per turn using Soul Points (SP). Safe Zone vs Danger Zone.

**Death Spiral**: Reshuffling adds Damage cards (blank dead draws) - inevitable decline.

**Facing Matters**: Rear arc +2 damage, side arc +1 damage, front arc full defense.
