## Key Concepts

**Deck-as-HP**: Your 30-card deck IS your HP. Discard cards when damaged.

**Component Damage**: Discard 3 Primary Weapon cards from damage = component destroyed = permanent effect.

**SP Economy**: Play multiple cards per turn using Soul Points (SP). Safe Zone vs Danger Zone.

**Death Spiral**: Reshuffling adds Damage cards (blank dead draws) - inevitable decline.

**Facing Matters**: Rear arc +2 damage, side arc +1 damage, front arc full defense.
