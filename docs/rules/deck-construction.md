---

## Core Principle

**Your deck IS your Casket.** Cards represent equipment, actions, and damage. Building your deck is customizing your war machine.

---

## Universal Deck Construction Rules

### Deck Size Formula (v2.0 Base Rules)

Total Deck = 10 Universal + 6 Faction Core + X Equipment + 2 Tactics

Where X depends on your class and loadout. Typical totals range from 26–50 cards (fewer cards = faster cycling, more cards = more HP/endurance).

### Mandatory Components

**Every deck must contain**:

1. **Exactly 10 Universal Cards** (see [universal-cards.md](universal-cards.md))
   - 3 Movement cards
   - 3 Defense cards
   - 3 Utility cards
   - 1 Wild card
   - **Cannot be removed or swapped** (core Casket functions)

2. **Right Arm equipment** (weapon, shield, or tool)
3. **Left Arm equipment** (weapon, shield, or tool)
4. **Relic slots** (0-3 depending on weight class)

---

### Card Copy Limits

**Maximum 2 copies** of any single card in your deck

**Exception**: Universal cards appear once each (only 1 copy allowed)

**How duplicates occur**:
- Equipping 2 of the same weapon (e.g., dual daggers, 2 longswords)
- Equipping mirrored equipment (Right + Left Arm)
- Some relics grant duplicate cards

**Example**:
- Equip Longsword (Right Arm): Adds 4 unique cards
- Equip Longsword (Left Arm): Adds 4 cards (some duplicates of Right Arm cards)
- Result: Some cards appear twice in deck (legal)

---

### Deck Size Details

**Base Deck = 10 Universal Cards + 6 Faction Core + Equipment Cards + 2 Tactics**

**Equipment cards** vary by what you equip:
- Each weapon adds 3-5 cards
- Each shield adds 2-3 cards
- Each relic adds 2-4 cards
- Source Conduit arms add 5 spell cards (fixed)

**Final deck size** depends on:
- Weight class (determines max equipment cards)
- Equipment choices (each piece adds cards)

Note: Examples below focus on equipment composition. Remember to add 2 Tactics cards when finalizing your deck.

**See weight class templates below for specifics.**

### Aberrant (600–1,500 lbs Variable)

**Total Deck Size**: 26–32 cards

Total: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 28 cards
```

**Note**: Aberrant decks gain Taint rapidly. High risk, high reward. Transformation to Abomination (10 Taint) is real threat.

---

## Special Equipment Rules

### Two-Handed Weapons

**Some weapons require both arms** (Greatsword, Giant Maul, Ballista Arm)

**Rules**:
- Takes up BOTH Right Arm AND Left Arm slots
- Cannot equip shield or second weapon
- Adds 5-7 cards total (larger card pool than single weapon)
- Usually higher damage, slower initiative

**Example**: Greatsword (Two-Hand)
- Occupies Right + Left Arm slots
- Adds 6 cards to deck
- Cannot use shield or dual-wield

---

### Source Conduit Arms

**Magical prosthetic arms** that cast spells instead of wielding weapons

**Rules**:
- Replaces Right OR Left Arm slot
- Adds **exactly 5 spell cards** from chosen school
- **+1 Hand Size** (total 7 cards in hand)
- Choose spell school: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Void, Nature

**Example**: Source Conduit (Right Arm) - Fire School
- Adds 5 Fire spell cards
- Hand size becomes 7
- Left Arm can still equip weapon/shield

**See [equipment-catalog.md](equipment-catalog.md) for spell school details.**

---

### Relic Tech (Ammo/Charges)

**Some relics use limited ammo** (rifles, rockets, grenades)

**Rules**:
- Start mission with X ammo tokens (usually 3-5)
- Cards require spending 1 ammo token to play
- Cannot play card if no ammo remaining
- Ammo does NOT refresh during mission
- Can be resupplied between missions (campaign mode)

**Example**: Thunderspeaker Rifle (Relic Tech)
- Start with 5 Ammo tokens
- Each shot costs 1 Ammo
- After 5 shots, rifle cards are unplayable
- Still in deck (dilution), but can't use them

---

## Racial Unique Cards

**Some races get unique cards** that reflect their abilities

**Rules**:
- **Optional**: Not required, but available
- Add 0-2 racial cards to deck (doesn't count against equipment budget)
- Must meet requirements (e.g., Undead Death's Door requires 3+ Taint start)

**Examples**:

**Human - Vow Cards**:
- 1 card per Vow chosen (max 1 Vow per mission)
- Adds restriction + bonus card

**Undead - Soul Reserve**:
- Separate 5-card emergency deck (not in main deck)
- Drawn when triggering Death's Door ability

**Orcish - Scrap Fury**:
- Passive ability (no cards added)
- Bonuses increase per reshuffle

**Fae - Bargain Cards**:
- 2 cards (Invoke Bargain, Pay Price)
- Adds risky burst potential

---

## Deck Building Process (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Choose Weight Class
- Scout, Support, Heavy, Assault, or Aberrant
- Determines Safe Zone SP, deck size range, relic slots

### Step 2: Choose Race
- Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Undead, Fae, Draconid
- Determines racial ability and potential unique cards

### Step 3: Equip Right Arm
- Weapon, shield, or tool
- Note how many cards it adds (3-5 typically)

### Step 4: Equip Left Arm
- Weapon, shield, or tool
- OR: Skip if using Two-Handed weapon
- Note how many cards it adds

### Step 5: Equip Relics
- Fill relic slots (1-3 depending on weight class)
- Balance utility vs power vs ammo management
- Note cards added per relic

### Step 6: Add Racial Cards (Optional)
- If your race has unique cards, decide if you want them
- Add 0-2 racial cards

### Step 7: Add Universal Cards
- Automatically add all 10 Universal cards
- These are mandatory, cannot be changed

### Step 8: Calculate Total Deck Size
- Count: 10 Universal + all equipment cards + racial cards
- Verify it's within your weight class range
- Example: Scout deck = 10 + 4 (rapier) + 3 (buckler) + 3 (jump jets) + 1 (racial) = 21 cards ✓ (within 22-26 range)

### Step 9: Double-Check Duplicates
- No more than 2 copies of any card
- Universal cards = 1 copy each (automatic)

### Step 10: Shuffle and Play!
- Shuffle your deck
- Draw starting hand (6 cards)
- Begin mission

---

## Deck Building Restrictions (Tournament Legal)

**For competitive play**:

1. **Weight Class Limits** (see templates above)
2. **No Homebrew** (only official/approved equipment)
3. **Relic Tech Limit**: Max 1 ammo-based relic per deck (prevents all-guns build)
4. **Corruption Gear Limit**: Max 3 "Tainted" or "Forbidden" keyword cards (prevents nova-corruption)
5. **Racial Lock**: Must use racial ability matching your Casket aesthetic (human can't use orcish Scrap Fury)

**For casual play**: Ignore restrictions, have fun!

---

## Campaign Deck Building

**Between missions, you can modify your deck**:

### Workshop (Spending Credits)
- **Buy new equipment**: 100-500 Credits (see [equipment-catalog.md](equipment-catalog.md))
- **Swap equipment**: Free (if you own multiple pieces)
- **Repair damaged components**: 50/150/500 Credits

### Deck Modifications
- Swap Right/Left Arm equipment
- Swap relics
- Adjust loadout for next mission

### Permanent Damage
- If component disabled (9+ damage), must replace equipment
- Lose access to those cards until replaced
- Can buy replacement at Workshop

**See [campaign-progression.md](campaign-progression.md) for full details.**

---

## Common Deck Archetypes

### "Glass Cannon" (Scout)
- Dual-wield weapons (rapier + dagger)
- No shield
- Jump jets for mobility
- High damage, zero defense
- **Risk**: One rear attack = death

### "Fortress" (Heavy)
- Great Shield + Warhammer
- All 3 relics = defensive (plating, stabilizers, vents)
- Immovable, absorbent
- **Risk**: Slow, can be avoided/kited

### "Support Medic" (Support)
- Tower Shield + Light Mace
- Repair Kit + Banner + Medical Supplies relics
- Keeps team alive
- **Risk**: Weak solo, dies if isolated

### "Berserker" (Assault + Orcish)
- Two-Handed Giant Maul (both arms)
- Reactor Overdrive + Scrap Plating + Berserker Implant
- Scrap Fury scaling damage
- High Heat generation
- **Risk**: Self-destructive, meltdown likely

### "Void Mage" (Aberrant)
- Source Conduit (Void School)
- Warp Anchor + Mutation Catalyst
- Teleport spamming, corruption stacking
- **Risk**: Transformation to Abomination at 10 Taint

---

## Deck Building Tips

### For New Players
1. **Start with balanced builds** (1 weapon, 1 shield, 1 utility relic)
2. **Don't over-specialize** (all offense or all defense = weak)
3. **Track your deck size** (count cards as you add equipment)
4. **Read Universal cards carefully** (they're 40-50% of Scout decks!)

### For Experienced Players
1. **Plan for reshuffles** (how fast will you cycle? How many Damage cards can you handle?)
2. **Synergy matters** (Scrap Fury Orcish + lots of cheap cards = fast reshuffles = stacking damage)
3. **Know your role** (Arena 2v2 needs 1 damage dealer + 1 support, not 2 glass cannons)
4. **Count SP efficiency** (Scout's 5 SP vs Assault's 2 SP changes card value)

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I have a 50-card deck?
**A**: No. Follow weight class deck size ranges (Scout: 22-26, Heavy: 32-38, etc.). Larger decks dilute combos and delay reshuffles (less Scrap Fury triggers, slower Damage card accumulation).

### Q: Can I remove Universal cards?
**A**: No. All 10 Universal cards are mandatory. They represent core Casket functions.

### Q: Can I have 3 copies of one card?
**A**: No. Max 2 copies per card.

### Q: What if I equip no weapons?
**A**: Legal but unwise. You'd have only Universal cards + relics. Can still win via objectives, but combat-weak.

### Q: Can I change my deck mid-mission?
**A**: No. Deck is locked once mission starts. You can only add Damage cards (from injuries).

### Q: Do Damage cards count toward deck size?
**A**: No. Base deck size is pre-mission. Damage cards are added during mission when you reshuffle after taking component damage.
