# Taint Exploitation System
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Version**: 3.0 (Trench Crusade Blood Marker-Inspired)
**Last Updated**: October 14, 2025

---

## Overview

Inspired by Trench Crusade's Blood Marker system, this mechanic makes **Taint** a tactical resource that can be exploited offensively. Previously, Taint was just a threshold (0-10 scale, hit 10 = Corruption). Now it's an active battlefield mechanic.

**Core Concept**:
- When you damage enemies, they accumulate **Taint Markers**
- YOU can spend THEIR Taint to debuff them
- THEY can spend their OWN Taint for desperate power (risk/reward)
- Creates offensive counterplay and mirrors Church's self-harm mechanics

---

## Gaining Taint Markers

### When Do You Gain Taint?

**Damage-Based Taint**:
- When you take damage, gain **1 Taint Marker per 3 damage dealt**
- Round down (5 damage = 1 Taint, 6 damage = 2 Taint)
- Place physical tokens next to your Casket

**Example**:
```
Enemy deals 8 damage to you
8 √∑ 3 = 2.67 ‚Üí Round down = 2 Taint Markers gained
```

---

**Event-Based Taint**:
- Taint Pulse card: All enemies within 3 hexes gain 2 Taint
- Void Embrace (Boss ability): All enemies gain 5 Taint
- Standing in Tainted Terrain: Gain 1 Taint per turn
- Capsule Breach: Gain 3 Taint (pilot exposed to Engine radiation)
- Failed Taint Save: Gain 1 Taint

---

**Self-Inflicted Taint** (Church Faction):
- Blood Offering: Discard 2 cards, gain 1 Taint, +3 damage next attack
- Martyrdom Ascension: Discard 3 cards, gain 2 Taint, permanent +1 damage buff
- Absolution card: Remove all Heat, recover 3 cards, gain 1 Taint

---

### Taint Threshold (Corruption Risk)

**Taint Accumulation**:
- 0-4 Taint: Safe (no penalties)
- 5-7 Taint: Danger Zone (penalties, see below)
- 8-9 Taint: Critical (severe penalties)
- 10+ Taint: **CORRUPTED** (roll save or lose control)

**When you reach 10+ Taint**:
- Roll 1d6 **immediately**
- 4+: You resist, stay at 10 Taint (cannot gain more)
- 1-3: **CORRUPTED** (see Corruption section below)

---

## Offensive Taint Exploitation

### YOU Can Spend THEIR Taint

**When attacking an enemy with Taint Markers, you may spend their Taint for offensive bonuses BEFORE rolling Attack Dice.**

---

### Exploitation Options

**[COST: 1 TAINT] - EXPOSED WEAKNESS**
- **Effect**: Gain Advantage on this attack (roll 3 Attack Dice, take 2 highest)
- **Why**: Their corruption makes them sluggish, predictable
- **Timing**: Declare before rolling Attack Dice

**[COST: 2 TAINT] - FORCE REROLL**
- **Effect**: Force target to reroll up to 2 successful Defense Dice
- **Why**: Their Taint disrupts their defenses
- **Timing**: After target rolls Defense Dice, before applying damage

**[COST: 1 TAINT] - HEAT SPIKE**
- **Effect**: Target gains +1 Heat immediately
- **Why**: Their corruption causes thermal instability
- **Timing**: Any time on your turn

**[COST: 3 TAINT] - COMPONENT VULNERABILITY**
- **Effect**: This attack deals +1 Component Damage (even if no Primary Weapon cards discarded)
- **Why**: Their Taint has weakened structural integrity
- **Timing**: Declare before rolling Attack Dice

**[COST: 4 TAINT] - NEURAL DISRUPTION**
- **Effect**: Target cannot play Reactive cards against this attack
- **Why**: Their pilot's mind is clouded by Engine whispers
- **Timing**: Declare before rolling Attack Dice

**[COST: 5 TAINT] - TAINT OVERLOAD**
- **Effect**: Target immediately flips 1 Pilot Wound card (neural feedback)
- **Why**: Their accumulated corruption burns out their neural threads
- **Timing**: Any time on your turn

---

### Exploitation Example

```
SETUP:
- Enemy Dwarven Ironclad has 6 Taint Markers
- You're attacking with Faithful Thrust (4 damage)
- Range: Medium (5 hexes)

YOUR TURN:
1. Spend 1 Taint (Enemy now has 5 Taint)
   ‚Üí Gain Advantage (roll 3 Attack Dice, take 2 highest)

2. Roll 3 Attack Dice: ‚öîÔ∏è (3) + üíÄ (5) + ‚öôÔ∏è (0)
   ‚Üí Discard ‚öôÔ∏è, keep ‚öîÔ∏è + üíÄ = 8 total
   ‚Üí Strong Hit! (+1 damage, total 5 damage)

3. Enemy rolls 5 Defense Dice: üõ°Ô∏è üõ°Ô∏è ü©∏ ü©∏ üíÄ
   ‚Üí 2 blocks, 1 Critical (Component Damage)
   ‚Üí Reduced to 3 damage

4. You spend 2 more Taint (Enemy now has 3 Taint)
   ‚Üí Force Reroll on 2 successful blocks (üõ°Ô∏è üõ°Ô∏è)

5. Enemy rerolls 2 Defense Dice: ü©∏ üî•
   ‚Üí No blocks! Heat added
   ‚Üí Final damage: 5 (no reduction)

6. Enemy discards 5 cards + gains 1 Heat + takes 1 Component Damage
```

**In this example, you spent 3 of their 6 Taint to turn a mediocre hit into devastating damage.**

---

## Defensive Taint Exploitation

### THEY Can Spend THEIR OWN Taint

**When YOU have Taint Markers, you may spend them for desperate power. BUT: This increases your Corruption risk.**

---

### Desperate Power Options

**[COST: 2 TAINT] - TAINTED FURY**
- **Effect**: +2 damage to your next attack this turn
- **Risk**: Gain 1 Heat, move +1 closer to Corruption threshold
- **Why**: You channel Engine energy into your strike
- **Timing**: Before rolling Attack Dice

**[COST: 3 TAINT] - IGNORE PAIN**
- **Effect**: Reduce next damage taken by 3 (before Defense roll)
- **Risk**: Gain 1 Heat
- **Why**: You numb yourself to physical damage with corruption
- **Timing**: When attacked, before Defense roll

**[COST: 1 TAINT] - VOID STEP**
- **Effect**: Move 2 hexes (costs 0 SP)
- **Risk**: Gain 1 Heat
- **Why**: You warp space momentarily
- **Timing**: On your turn, Action Phase

**[COST: 4 TAINT] - THERMAL PURGE**
- **Effect**: Remove ALL Heat, ignore Strain roll this turn
- **Risk**: Permanent -1 SP maximum (until end of mission)
- **Why**: You vent corruption-tainted heat explosively
- **Timing**: Start of your turn, during Refresh Phase

**[COST: 5 TAINT] - RESURRECTION PROTOCOL** (Once per battle)
- **Effect**: When your Casket HP reaches 0, reshuffle discard pile and return with 10 cards
- **Risk**: Pilot immediately flips 2 Wound cards (permanent damage)
- **Why**: Engine energy reanimates your Casket, but burns your soul
- **Timing**: When defeated

---

### Self-Exploitation Example

```
SETUP:
- You're Church Confessor with 7 Taint Markers (Danger Zone)
- Enemy about to attack you for 6 damage
- You have 12 cards left in deck

YOUR DEFENSIVE OPTIONS:

OPTION A: Spend 3 Taint ‚Üí "Ignore Pain"
- Reduce 6 damage to 3 damage
- Now at 4 Taint (Safe Zone, but gained 1 Heat)
- Saved 3 cards from discard

OPTION B: Take the damage, save Taint for offense
- Take full 6 damage
- Stay at 7 Taint
- Next turn, spend 2 Taint on "Tainted Fury" (+2 damage counterattack)

DECISION: Do you burn Taint defensively (safe) or save it for alpha strike offense (risky)?
```

---

## Taint Zone Penalties

### Danger Zone (5-7 Taint)

**Passive Penalties**:
- Enemies can exploit your Taint offensively (see Exploitation Options)
- -1 to all Pilot Grit checks (if using Grit system)
- Cannot benefit from healing/recovery cards (Engine corruption resists repair)

**Visual Effect**: Your Casket's soulstone glows sickly green, threads pulse with dark energy

---

### Critical Zone (8-9 Taint)

**Passive Penalties** (in addition to Danger Zone):
- -1 SP maximum (corruption saps energy)
- All Heat generation +1 (thermal instability)
- Enemy attacks against you gain Advantage (your corruption makes you vulnerable)

**Visual Effect**: Casket leaks black ichor, pilot screams in capsule, threads writhe

---

### Corruption Threshold (10+ Taint)

**When you reach 10+ Taint, roll 1d6 immediately**:

**CORRUPTION SAVE (1d6)**:
- **4-6**: You resist! Stay at 10 Taint, cannot gain more (capped)
- **1-3**: **CORRUPTED** - Roll on Corruption Table

---

### Corruption Table (1d6)

**If you fail Corruption Save, roll 1d6**:

**1-2: PUPPET OF THE ENGINE**
- Enemy controls your Casket for 1 full turn (mind control)
- After 1 turn, return to your control at 5 Taint

**3-4: TAINT NOVA**
- You explode in Engine energy
- Deal 3d6 damage to all units within 3 hexes (including allies)
- You take 6 damage (discard 6 cards)
- Reset to 0 Taint

**5-6: MUTATION**
- Pilot flips 1 Severe Injury Wound card immediately
- Casket gains permanent mutation (roll 1d6):
  - 1-2: Clawed Limb (+1 melee damage, but -1 SP max)
  - 3-4: Third Eye (Ignore Disadvantage from cover, but -1 Defense)
  - 5-6: Void Touched (Can spend Taint at -1 cost, but gain +1 Taint per turn)
- Reset to 5 Taint

---

## Taint Removal

**How to Remove Taint**:

**Passive Decay**:
- Remove 1 Taint at end of each mission (natural purging)
- Cannot remove Taint mid-battle (unless card says so)

**Card Effects**:
- "Absolution" (Church Tactic): Remove ALL Taint, but gain 1 Taint immediately (net -X+1)
- "Purification Ritual" (Settlement): Remove 3 Taint, costs 50 Credits

**Risky Purge**:
- Spend full turn in "Meditation" (0 actions, 0 movement)
- At end of turn, remove 2 Taint
- You cannot defend (all attacks against you have Advantage)

**Death**:
- When your Casket is defeated, reset Taint to 0 (new pilot, new mission)

---

## Taint Terrain (Environmental Hazard)

**Some hexes are "Tainted" by Engine corruption**:

**Tainted Ground** (green glow, warped metal):
- Standing in Tainted hex at end of turn: Gain 1 Taint
- Moving through Tainted hex: No penalty (just passing through)
- Attacks FROM Tainted hex: Gain 1 Taint per attack

**Tainted Water** (black ichor pools):
- Standing in Tainted water: Gain 2 Taint per turn
- BUT: Remove 2 Heat per turn (cooling but corrupting)
- Trade-off: Manage Heat vs Taint

**Scenario Example**:
```
"The Blighted Forge" scenario:
- 30% of hexes are Tainted Ground
- Players must choose: Avoid Tainted hexes (limits movement) or risk Taint for positioning
```

---

## Faction Interactions with Taint

### Church of Absolution
**Martyrdom Theme**: Church WANTS Taint for self-sacrifice mechanics
- "Blood Offering" card: Gain 1 Taint, +3 damage next attack
- "Flagellant's Zeal" Tactic: Gain 3 Taint, recover 5 cards
- Church pilots are MORE RESISTANT to Corruption:
  - Corruption Save: 3+ instead of 4+ (zealotry protects them)

### Dwarven Forge-Guilds
**Rune-Warded**: Dwarves are RESISTANT to Taint
- Gain Taint at half rate (6 damage = 1 Taint instead of 2)
- "Stone Endurance" passive: Cannot be exploited offensively until 8+ Taint
- BUT: Cannot spend own Taint for Desperate Power (rune-locked, no corruption access)

### The Ossuarium
**Taint as Resource**: Ossuarium THRIVES on Taint
- Gain Taint normally
- "Soul Harvest" card: Spend 2 Taint, recover 3 cards from discard
- "Decay Aura" passive: Enemies within 3 hexes gain 1 Taint per turn
- Corruption Save: 5+ (very resistant, they're already undead)

### Elven Verdant Covenant
**Nature vs Corruption**: Elves are VULNERABLE to Taint
- Gain Taint at double rate (3 damage = 2 Taint instead of 1)
- "Regeneration" cards: Remove 1 Taint when used
- Corruption Save: 5+ only if in Forest terrain (nature protects them)
- If Corrupted, mutation effects are MORE severe

---

## Strategic Depth

### Offensive Taint Stacking

**"Taint Bomb" Strategy**:
1. Focus fire on 1 enemy to stack Taint (get them to 6+ Taint)
2. Once high Taint, spend it aggressively (Exposed Weakness, Force Reroll, Component Vulnerability)
3. Finish them before they can self-purge

**Example**:
```
Turn 1: Deal 9 damage ‚Üí Enemy gains 3 Taint
Turn 2: Deal 6 damage ‚Üí Enemy gains 2 Taint (total 5)
Turn 3: Spend 3 Taint on Component Vulnerability ‚Üí Guaranteed Component Destruction
```

---

### Defensive Taint Management

**"Risk/Reward" Decision**:
- Do I spend Taint for immediate power (Tainted Fury) or save it for Resurrection Protocol?
- Do I accept Taint for positioning (stand in Tainted Ground for better angle)?
- Do I use Church's Blood Offering (gain Taint) for alpha strike?

**Example**:
```
You have 6 Taint (Danger Zone)
Option A: Spend 2 Taint on Tainted Fury (+2 damage), drop to 4 Taint (Safe)
Option B: Save Taint, stay at 6, risk enemy exploiting it but keep Resurrection Protocol available
```

---

### Church "Taint Martyr" Build

**Maximize self-inflicted Taint for burst damage**:
1. Play Blood Offering (+1 Taint, +3 damage)
2. Stand in Tainted Ground (+1 Taint per turn)
3. At 7-8 Taint, spend 2 Taint on Tainted Fury (+2 damage)
4. Total: +5 damage from Taint manipulation
5. Risk: You're at 5-6 Taint after spending, vulnerable to enemy exploitation

---

## Playtesting Notes

### If Taint Accumulates Too Fast:
- Change rate to 1 Taint per 5 damage (instead of 3)
- Reduce Event-Based Taint sources (Taint Pulse gives 1 Taint instead of 2)
- Allow Taint removal mid-battle (Meditation action removes 1 Taint)

### If Exploitation Feels Too Powerful:
- Increase costs (Exposed Weakness costs 2 Taint instead of 1)
- Limit exploits to 1 per turn (can't chain multiple)
- Add risk to exploitation (spend enemy Taint, but YOU gain 1 Taint)

### If Corruption Happens Too Often:
- Change threshold from 10 to 12
- Improve Corruption Save to 3+ (instead of 4+)
- Remove Critical Zone penalties (only penalize at 10+ Taint)

### If Taint Feels Irrelevant:
- Increase damage-to-Taint rate (1 Taint per 2 damage)
- Add more Event-Based Taint sources
- Make Exploitation cheaper (Exposed Weakness costs 0 Taint, just requires enemy have 3+ Taint)

---

## Designer's Notes

### Why Taint Exploitation Works

1. **Offensive Counterplay**: Not just "deal damage," but "stack Taint, then exploit it"
2. **Risk/Reward**: Church can self-Taint for power, but risks Corruption
3. **Faction Asymmetry**: Dwarves resist, Elves vulnerable, Ossuarium thrive, Church weaponize
4. **Trench Crusade Inspiration**: Blood Markers create similar offensive/defensive dynamics

### Differences from Blood Markers

**Trench Crusade Blood Markers**:
- Represent physical/spiritual damage
- Spent to finish off models or debuff them
- Binary: Model is up or down

**Penance Taint Markers**:
- Represent Engine corruption accumulation
- Spent offensively (by enemies) or defensively (by self)
- Threshold-based: Reach 10 = Corruption risk

## FAQ

**Q: Can I spend enemy Taint multiple times per attack?**
A: Yes, but each exploit must be paid for separately. Example: Spend 1 Taint (Advantage) + 4 Taint (Neural Disruption) = 5 Taint total spent.

**Q: Can I exploit my own Taint offensively?**
A: No. You can only spend YOUR Taint for Desperate Power (defensive/utility). Only ENEMIES can exploit your Taint offensively.

**Q: What happens if I'm at 10 Taint and gain more?**
A: If you already passed Corruption Save (stayed at 10), you cannot gain more. If you failed and Corrupted, reset per Corruption Table result.

**Q: Can I remove Taint mid-battle?**
A: Only via card effects or Meditation action (spend full turn meditating, remove 2 Taint). Otherwise, Taint persists until end of mission.

**Q: Does spending Taint for Desperate Power move me away from Corruption threshold?**
A: Yes! If you're at 7 Taint and spend 2 Taint on Tainted Fury, you drop to 5 Taint (out of Danger Zone).

**Q: Can multiple enemies exploit the same Taint pool?**
A: Yes. If you have 8 Taint, Enemy A can spend 3 Taint (you now have 5), then Enemy B can spend 2 Taint (you now have 3). First come, first served.

**Q: Do Taint Markers carry over between missions?**
A: No (unless scenario says so). At mission end, remove 1 Taint naturally. At campaign mission start, reset to 0.
