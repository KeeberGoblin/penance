# Component Damage System: AP/Structure/Pilot Exposure
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Version**: 3.0 Comprehensive Rules (October 17, 2025)

---

## Overview: Three-Layer Defense

**Lore Context:** Caskets are mechanical armored frames powered by Soulstone energy. Pilots are living humans (usually desperate, dying, or half-dead volunteers) who have undergone soul-binding. The pilot is suspended in neural fluid inside a containment chamber (the capsule) within the Casket's chassis, arms crossed like a mummy. Ten neural threads pierce through their fingertips, connecting to the Casket's control nodes. The pilot manipulates the Casket like a puppeteer controlling a marionette‚Äîfrom inside. They are NOT autonomous machines - living pilots control every movement through the neural thread interface.

Caskets have **dual-layer HP tracking**:

1. **Casket HP Deck** (26-50 cards) - Overall structural integrity of the mechanical frame
2. **Component HP** (per limb) - Localized damage with **pilot chamber exposure risk**

**When you take damage:**
- **Discard cards** from deck/hand (Casket HP loss)
- **Equipment cards discarded** add Component Damage to targeted limb
- **Defense Dice CRITICAL symbols** add Component Damage (bypass AP)

**Each component has three defensive zones:**
- **AP Layer** (Armor Plating) - Absorbs early damage, no penalties
- **Structure Layer** - Functional penalties, component degrading
- **Pilot Exposure Zone** - **Every Component Damage = +1 Pilot Wound**

## Component HP Table (Master Reference)

| Component | Total HP | AP Zone | Structure Zone | Pilot Exposure Zone | Destroyed |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Head** | 6 HP | 0-2 dmg | 3-4 dmg | 5-6 dmg | 6+ dmg |
| **Right Arm** | 8 HP | 0-3 dmg | 4-5 dmg | 6-8 dmg | 8+ dmg |
| **Left Arm** | 8 HP | 0-3 dmg | 4-5 dmg | 6-8 dmg | 8+ dmg |
| **Chassis** | 10 HP | 0-4 dmg | 5-6 dmg | 7-10 dmg | 10+ dmg |
| **Legs** | 8 HP | 0-3 dmg | 4-8 dmg | NEVER | 8+ dmg |

**Key Insight:** Legs have no pilot exposure (capsule is in chassis, above legs)

---

## How Component Damage Accumulates

### Sources of Component Damage

**1. Equipment Cards Discarded When Taking Damage**
- When you discard cards to absorb damage:
  - **Primary Weapon cards** ‚Üí +1 Component Damage to targeted component
  - **Shield/Offhand cards** ‚Üí +1 Component Damage if targeting Left Arm
  - **Accessory cards** ‚Üí No Component Damage (utility equipment)

**2. Defense Dice CRITICAL Symbols (‚öîÔ∏è)**
- When rolling Defense Dice, each CRITICAL symbol:
  - **Bypasses AP layer entirely**
  - Adds +1 Component Damage directly to structure
  - Cannot be prevented (armor-piercing effect)

**3. Special Attack Effects**
- Some cards have "Armor-Piercing" or "Ignore AP" keywords
- These add Component Damage directly to structure layer

---

## Damage Flow Sequence (Step-by-Step)

### STEP 1: Attack Declared
- Attacker plays attack card
- **Declares target component** (choose one method):

**Method A: Attacker Chooses** (Tactical)
- Attacker selects which component to target
- **Recommended default** (gives attacker tactical control)
- Example: "I'm targeting your exposed Right Arm"

**Method B: Random Hit Location** (Chaotic)
- Roll **1d6** to determine hit location:
  - **1:** Head
  - **2:** Left Arm
  - **3:** Right Arm
  - **4-5:** Chassis (2 faces, most likely target)
  - **6:** Legs
- Use when attack card doesn't specify, or for "wild" attacks
- Creates unpredictability (might hit fresh armor or exposed component)

**Method C: Card Specifies** (Some cards have built-in targeting)
- Example: "Leg Sweep" (automatic Legs target)
- Example: "Headshot" (automatic Head target)
- Card text overrides player choice

- Rolls Attack Dice to hit

### STEP 2: Defender Response (If Hit)
**A. Play Reactive Card (Optional)**
- Defender may play [‚Äî] Initiative reactive card (0 SP)
- Shields reduce **total damage** (affects both Casket HP and Component Damage)
- Example: "Deflect" reduces 2 damage ‚Üí 6 damage becomes 4 damage

**B. Roll Defense Dice**
- Roll **1d6 Defense Die per damage point** (after shields)
- Count symbols:
  - üõ°Ô∏è **SHIELD** / **ABSORB** ‚Üí Block 1 damage each
  - ‚öîÔ∏è **CRITICAL** ‚Üí +1 Component Damage (bypasses AP)
  - üî• **HEAT** ‚Üí +1 Heat to defender
  - üó°Ô∏è **PIERCE** ‚Üí Defender cannot use reactive cards (too late if already rolled)
  - üíî **FLESH WOUND** ‚Üí Take damage normally

### STEP 3: Apply Damage to Casket HP
- Final damage = Original damage - Shield blocks - Defense blocks
- Defender **discards cards** (from hand, deck, or mix)
- **Choice matters:**
  - Discard from **hand** ‚Üí Control what's lost, but lose tactical options
  - Discard from **deck** ‚Üí Random, might hit key cards, but preserve hand

### STEP 4: Calculate Component Damage
**Count all sources:**
1. **Equipment cards discarded** (Primary Weapon, Shield/Offhand)
2. **CRITICAL symbols** from Defense Dice

**Example:**
- Took 5 damage, discarded:
  - 2√ó Primary Weapon cards from hand
  - 1√ó Universal card from hand
  - 2√ó cards from deck (random)
- Defense Dice showed 1√ó CRITICAL
- **Component Damage = 2 (Primary Weapon cards) + 1 (CRITICAL) = 3 total**

### STEP 5: Apply Component Damage to Target
- Add Component Damage to targeted component's HP track
- Check which zone component is now in (AP / Structure / Pilot Exposure)
- Apply effects immediately

### STEP 6: Check for Pilot Wounds
**If component is in Pilot Exposure Zone:**
- **For each Component Damage that occurred in Pilot Exposure Zone:**
  - Pilot flips 1 Wound card

**Example:**
- Right Arm was at 5/8 HP (structure zone)
- Took 3 Component Damage ‚Üí Now at 8/8 HP (destroyed)
- Damage progression: 5 ‚Üí 6 (enters exposure) ‚Üí 7 (still exposed) ‚Üí 8 (destroyed)
- **Pilot Wounds:**
  - 5‚Üí6: +1 Wound (entered exposure)
  - 6‚Üí7: +1 Wound (still exposed)
  - 7‚Üí8: +1 Wound (destruction)
  - **Total: 3 Pilot Wounds from this attack**

   - When **total Component Damage across ALL components reaches 5+** ‚Üí +1 Wound (triggers once per threshold)
   - Check at end of each attack that adds Component Damage
   - **Clarification**: This triggers once when you first reach 5 total Component Damage, then again at 10, 15, etc.

5. **Casket HP Deck Empty**
   - Deck + Discard both empty ‚Üí Pilot rolls save (1d6)
   - 1-3: +2 Wounds (structural collapse)
   - 4-6: Survives extraction (0 Wounds)

**10 Wounds Flipped = PILOT DEATH**

## SCRAP Card System (Destroyed Component Cards)

### When Component is Destroyed

**All equipment cards associated with that component become "SCRAP":**
- Primary Weapon cards (if Right Arm destroyed)
- Shield/Offhand cards (if Left Arm destroyed)
- Cards **remain in deck** but lose original function

### SCRAP Card Universal Rules

**SCRAP cards have new universal effect (ignore printed text):**

### Cannibalize Action (0 SP)

**Play SCRAP card as action during your turn:**
- **Cost:** 0 SP (free action)
- **Effect:** Discard this SCRAP card ‚Üí Draw 1 card immediately
- **Limit:** Can play as many SCRAP cards per turn as you have
- **Timing:** During Action Phase (not reactive)

**Strategic Uses:**
- **Cycle dead draws:** Convert 3 SCRAP cards ‚Üí Draw 3 fresh cards (0 SP total)
- **Dig for key cards:** Cycle SCRAP until you find the card you need
- **Avoid hand clog:** Don't waste turns with 4 SCRAP + 2 useful cards

**Example Turn with SCRAP:**
```
Church Confessor, Right Arm destroyed (12 Primary Weapon cards = SCRAP)

Hand: [SCRAP] [SCRAP] [SCRAP] [Desperate Lunge] [Brace for Impact] [Emergency Vent]

Action Phase:
1. Play SCRAP card (0 SP) ‚Üí Cannibalize ‚Üí Draw 1 (get "Rally Cry")
2. Play SCRAP card (0 SP) ‚Üí Cannibalize ‚Üí Draw 1 (get "Feint")
3. Play SCRAP card (0 SP) ‚Üí Cannibalize ‚Üí Draw 1 (get another SCRAP, discard it)
4. Play "Feint" (1 SP) ‚Üí +1 damage next attack
5. Move 2 hexes (2 SP)
6. Play "Bash" with Left Arm (1 SP) ‚Üí Attack for 2 damage + 1 (Feint) = 3 damage

Total: Cycled 3 SCRAP cards for free, used 4 SP for actions
```

## Damage Mitigation Layers (In Order)

### Layer 1: Reactive Cards (Shields)
- Played **before** Defense Dice roll
- Reduces **total damage**
- Example: "Deflect" (-2 damage) ‚Üí 7 damage becomes 5 damage

**Strategic Choice:**
- Use shield early (protect AP layer)?
- Save shield for pilot exposure zone?
- No shields in hand = Take full damage

### Layer 2: Defense Dice
- Roll **1d6 per damage point** (after reactive cards)
- SHIELD/ABSORB symbols ‚Üí Block damage
- CRITICAL symbols ‚Üí **Add Component Damage** (bypasses AP)

**Randomness Factor:**
- 8 damage attack ‚Üí Defender rolls 8 dice
- Lucky roll: 4√ó SHIELD = Block 4 damage (only take 4)
- Unlucky roll: 3√ó CRITICAL = +3 Component Damage (bypasses AP, could enter exposure zone)

### Layer 3: Discard Choice (Casket HP)
- Defender chooses which cards to discard
- **From hand:** Control what's lost, but lose tactical options
- **From deck:** Random, but preserve hand

**Component Damage Impact:**
- Discarding **Primary Weapon cards** ‚Üí +1 Component Damage each
- Discarding **Universal cards** ‚Üí No Component Damage
- Strategic: "Do I sacrifice weapon cards to take Component Damage, or discard from deck randomly?"

### Layer 4: Component AP Layer
- First X damage to component absorbed by armor
- **No functional penalties** while in AP zone
- Once AP depleted ‚Üí Structure damage begins

### Layer 5: Component Structure
- Functional penalties accumulate
- Component still operational but degraded
- **No pilot wounds yet** (pilot still protected by inner structure)

### Layer 6: Pilot Exposure Zone
- **Every Component Damage = +1 Pilot Wound**
- Pilot directly at risk
- Component near destruction

---

## Tactical Decision Points

### For Attacker: Target Selection

**Q: Which component to target?**

**Option A: Focus Fire (Destroy One Component)**
- Pros: Guaranteed to cripple one system, force SCRAP cards
- Cons: Other components still at full HP, pilot protected longer
- Example: Destroy Right Arm (8 hits) ‚Üí Enemy loses all weapon attacks

**Option B: Spread Damage (Multiple Pilot Exposures)**
- Pros: Multiple components in exposure zones ‚Üí Every future hit causes Pilot Wounds
- Cons: No components fully destroyed, enemy still has all tools
- Example: Get Head to 5/6, Right Arm to 6/8, Chassis to 7/10 ‚Üí All exposed, every hit hurts pilot

**Option C: Snipe Weak Components**
- Pros: Head only 6 HP (easy to destroy), immediate impact
- Cons: Less pilot wound potential than Chassis, enemy can still fight
- Example: Destroy Head (6 hits) ‚Üí Enemy blind, -2 ranged, +2 Heat/turn

**Option D: Chassis Rush (High Risk/Reward)**
- Pros: Chassis destruction = +3 Wounds immediately, possible instant death
- Cons: Chassis has 10 HP (highest), 4 AP (most armor), takes many turns
- Example: Pummel Chassis relentlessly ‚Üí If destroyed, likely victory

### For Defender: Survival Choices

**Q: Discard from hand or deck?**

**Discard from Hand:**
- Pros: Control Component Damage (avoid discarding Primary Weapon cards)
- Cons: Lose tactical options, smaller hand = fewer plays next turn

**Discard from Deck:**
- Pros: Preserve hand (keep reactive shields, attack cards)
- Cons: Random, might discard Primary Weapon cards anyway ‚Üí Component Damage

**Mixed Strategy:**
- Discard non-critical cards from hand first (Universal cards)
- Then discard from deck
- Save key cards (shields, finisher attacks)

**Q: Use shield now or save?**

**Use Shield Early (AP Zone):**
- Pros: Preserve armor, delay pilot exposure
- Cons: Waste shield when pilot not at risk

**Save Shield for Exposure Zone:**
- Pros: Protect pilot life when critical
- Cons: Might not survive to exposure zone without shields

### For Both: SP Economy Under Pressure

**Wounded pilots have reduced SP maximum:**
- 6 SP ‚Üí 3 SP (after -3 from wounds)
- Can only afford small actions
- Must cannibalize SCRAP cards for cycling
- Cannot afford big attacks (5 SP) anymore

**Strategic Shift:**
- Early game: Big attacks (5 SP), mobility (3 hexes)
- Late game (wounded): Small attacks (2 SP), minimal movement (1 hex)
- Desperation: Overspend SP (pay with cards) for final push

## Quick Reference: Damage Math

**Taking 6 damage to Right Arm (currently at 4/8 HP):**

1. **Reactive card?** ‚Üí Play "Deflect" (-2 damage) = 4 damage final
2. **Roll 4 Defense Dice:** üõ°Ô∏èüíî‚öîÔ∏èüíî
   - 1√ó SHIELD = -1 damage = **3 damage to Casket HP**
   - 1√ó CRITICAL = +1 Component Damage
3. **Discard 3 cards:** 1√ó Primary Weapon from hand, 2√ó from deck (1√ó Primary Weapon)
   - Component Damage = 2 (cards) + 1 (CRITICAL) = **+3 total**
4. **Right Arm: 4 ‚Üí 7/8 HP**
   - 4 (AP zone) ‚Üí 5 (structure, -1 dmg) ‚Üí 6 (exposure, +1 Wound) ‚Üí 7 (exposure, +1 Wound)
   - **Total: +2 Pilot Wounds this attack**

**Final state:**
- Casket HP: -3 cards
- Right Arm: 7/8 HP (pilot exposed, -2 damage)
- Pilot: +2 Wounds
- 1 hit away from Right Arm destruction

## Edge Cases and Clarifications

### Q: What if I take 10 Component Damage to a 6 HP component?
**A:** Component destroyed at 6 HP. Excess damage is wasted (doesn't transfer to other components).

**Example:**
- Head at 3/6 HP, takes 8 Component Damage
- 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 (enter exposure, +1 Wound) ‚Üí 6 (destroyed, +1 Wound) ‚Üí 7-10 (excess, no effect)
- Total: +2 Pilot Wounds, Head destroyed

---

### Q: Can I target a destroyed component?
**A:** Yes, but pointless.
- Component already destroyed, no equipment cards left to discard
- Defense Dice CRITICALS would add Component Damage, but component already destroyed
- No additional Pilot Wounds (component already destroyed means past exposure zone)

---

### Q: If my Right Arm is destroyed, do I still take Component Damage when discarding SCRAP Primary Weapon cards?
**A:** No.
- SCRAP cards are generic (not equipment type anymore)
- Discarding SCRAP does not add Component Damage
- SCRAP cards only count as Casket HP (body mass)

---

### Q: Can I voluntarily discard Primary Weapon cards to avoid Component Damage?
**A:** No.
- You must discard from hand or deck (your choice of source)
- If you discard from deck, it's random (can't cherry-pick)
- If you discard Primary Weapon cards from hand, you take Component Damage (no choice)

**Strategic workaround:** Discard all non-Primary cards from hand first, then discard from deck

---

### Q: What if I have no cards in hand and deck is empty?
**A:** Casket defeated.
- Cannot absorb damage
- Casket structural failure
- Pilot rolls ejection save (see Chassis destruction rules)

---

### Q: Can shields block Component Damage?
**A:** Indirectly, yes.
- Shields reduce **total damage** (before Defense Dice)
- Less damage = fewer cards discarded = less Component Damage
- But Defense Dice CRITICALS still bypass shields and add Component Damage

---

### Q: If I'm in Pilot Exposure Zone, do I take Wounds for damage that doesn't add Component Damage?
**A:** No.
- Pilot Wounds only occur when **Component Damage is added while in Exposure Zone**
- If you discard 5 Universal cards (no Component Damage), no Pilot Wounds
- Only equipment cards discarded (Primary Weapon, Shield) add Component Damage

---

### Q: Can I target multiple components with one attack?
**A:** No (normally).
- Attacker declares 1 target component per attack
- Some special cards have "Cleave" (deal damage to multiple targets)
- For Cleave attacks, defender distributes damage and rolls Defense Dice per target separately

---

### Q: Does Neural Feedback (15+ total Component Damage) stack with Pilot Exposure Wounds?
**A:** Yes.
- If attack pushes total Component Damage from 14 to 17 (across all components):
  - Pilot Exposure Wounds apply per attack
  - Neural Feedback triggers once at 15+ threshold (+1 Wound)
  - Both sources apply

---

## Campaign Implications

### Destroyed Components Persist Between Missions

**In campaign mode:**
- Destroyed components require **repairs** at settlement
- Repairs cost **Scrap** (salvaged materials) and **time** (mission turns)
- SCRAP cards remain in deck until repaired

**Repair Costs:**
| Component | Scrap Cost | Time (Missions) |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Head | 3 Scrap | 1 mission |
| Arm | 5 Scrap | 2 missions |
| Chassis | 10 Scrap | 3 missions |
| Legs | 6 Scrap | 2 missions |

**If not repaired:**
- Must deploy with SCRAP cards in deck
- Component still destroyed (functional penalties persist)
- Can cannibalize SCRAP for cycling, but deck bloated

---

### Pilot Wounds Persist Between Missions

**Minor Injuries (5 cards):**
- Last **1 mission** after flipped
- Removed during Settlement Phase recovery

**Severe Injuries (3 cards):**
- **PERMANENT** (campaign-long)
- Can only be healed with "Reconstructive Surgery" (rare, expensive)
- Pilot carries debuff for entire campaign

**Trauma (2 cards):**
- **PERMANENT** until psychological treatment
- Requires "Soul Cleansing" event or 5 missions rest

---

## Playtester Notes

**Tuning knobs for balance:**

1. **Component HP totals:** Increase if combats too fast, decrease if too slow
2. **AP layer thickness:** Increase AP = longer safe phase, decrease = faster exposure
3. **Pilot Exposure threshold:** Move earlier (lower HP) = more brutal, later = safer
4. **SCRAP Cannibalize cost:** Currently 0 SP (free), could charge 1 SP if too strong
5. **Pilot Wound deck size:** Currently 10 cards, increase to 12-15 if pilots die too fast

**Known power interactions:**
- Church "Blood Offering" self-harm ‚Üí Risks Component Damage ‚Üí Can self-expose pilot
- Dwarven "Rune Strike" Armor-Piercing ‚Üí Bypasses AP, hits structure directly ‚Üí Very strong against fresh components
- Ossuarium "Soul Harvest" ‚Üí Recovers cards from discard ‚Üí Can recover SCRAP cards and re-cannibalize
