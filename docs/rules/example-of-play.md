---

### ACTION 1: PLAY "MOVE" (1 SP)
**SP Cost**: 1
**Effect**: Move toward Kael

**Movement Path**: D6 → E6 → F6 (adjacent to Kael at G5)
- Leaves lava terrain (no more lava damage next turn!)

**Result**:
- Distance to Kael: Now adjacent (melee range)

**SP Remaining**: 4

---

### ACTION 2: PLAY "HONOR DUEL" (2 SP)
**SP Cost**: 2

---

### ACTION 3: PLAY "EMBERFORGED STRIKE" (3 SP, SPEND 2 FORGE TOKENS)
**SP Cost**: 3
**Forge Token Cost**: 2 (spend to increase damage)

**Damage Calculation**:
- **Base Damage**: 5
- **Forge Token Boost**: Spend 2 tokens → +2 damage + set target on fire

  - Component Damage: **NOT triggered** (need 3+ of same type)

**Forge Tokens**: 5 → 3 (spent 2)
**SP Remaining**: 0 (spent last 3 SP, but only had 2 SP available → ERROR!)

**CORRECTION**: Torrak only had 2 SP after Move (1) and Honor Duel (2). Cannot afford Emberforged Strike (3 SP).

---

### ACTION 3 (CORRECTED): PLAY "VOLCANIC SLASH" (2 SP)
**SP Cost**: 2 (affordable!)

**Damage Calculation**:

**Kael's Status**:
- **HP**: 26 cards (took 4 damage)
- **Burn Status**: Will take 2 damage next turn (none, Volcanic Slash doesn't burn)

---

## COMBAT CONTINUES...

This example demonstrates:
1. ✅ **SP Economy**: Each player has 5 SP per turn (Warden class)
2. ✅ **Card-as-HP**: Damage = discard cards from deck
3. ✅ **Faction Mechanics**: Forge tokens (Crucible), Blood Offering (Church)
4. ✅ **Support Units**: Act independently with behavior decks
5. ✅ **Honor Duels**: Challenge system with accept/refuse choice
6. ✅ **Component Damage**: Track discarded card types (3+ same = component destroyed)
7. ✅ **Terrain Effects**: Lava deals damage but generates Forge tokens
8. ✅ **Defense Buffs**: Temporary Defense from support units

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR NEW PLAYERS

### Resource Management
- **SP**: Spend wisely, cannot bank unspent SP
- **Forge Tokens / Blood Stacks**: Faction resources that persist across turns
- **Hand Size**: Always 6 cards (draw at start of turn, discard all at end)

### Damage = Card Loss
- Deck size = HP
- When you run out of cards, you lose
- Reshuffling adds "Damage" cards (dead draws)

### Component Damage
- When damaged, if 3+ cards of same type discarded → Component Destroyed
- Primary Weapon destroyed = lose all Primary Weapon cards from hand
- Creates death spiral (Kingdom Death-style)

### Support Units
- Act independently (behavior deck AI)
- Don't cost your SP
- Can turn tide of battle with buffs/debuffs

### Heat Management
- Gain Heat from powerful abilities
- At 5+ Heat, roll Strain (failures = bad effects)
- Vent Heat with abilities or end turn in safe zone

---

## NEXT STEPS

**For Full Combat Example**:
- Continue turns 4-10 (Kael retaliates, Honor Duel concludes)
- Show component damage trigger (3+ Primary Weapon cards discarded)
- Demonstrate Heat Strain mechanics
- Show reshuffling deck (add Damage cards)
- Conclude with Torrak victory (Kael deck hits 0)

**For Playtest**:
- Use this as template for first game
- Pre-build decks for both players (print cards)
- Use hex map (12×10 grid, 3 lava hexes)
- Track Forge tokens and Blood stacks with dice/tokens
