# Dice Reference (Custom Dice System)
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Version**: 3.0 (v3.0 Dice Pool Advantage Added)
**Last Updated**: October 14, 2025

---

## Overview

Penance uses **4 types of custom d6 dice** to add brutal randomness to combat:

1. **Attack Dice** (2d6) - Roll to-hit, determines if attack lands
2. **Defense Dice** (Xd6) - Roll per damage point, chance to block/mitigate
3. **Suffering Dice** (1d6) - Church faction & event self-harm mechanics
4. **Damage Die** (1d6) - DAMAGED card effects, wound penalties

**Design Philosophy**:
- GKR-style to-hit rolls (2d6 target numbers)
- BattleTech modifier stacking (range, movement, terrain)
- Kingdom Death save dice (block damage, critical effects)

---

## 1. Attack Dice (2d6)

### Die Face Symbols

| Face | Symbol | Value | Name |
|------|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | | 1 | GLANCE |
| 2 | | 2 | BLOOD |
| 3 | | 3 | STRIKE |
| 4 | | 4 | DOUBLE STRIKE |
| 5 | | 5 | DEATH BLOW |
| 6 | | 0 | JAM (critical fail face) |

**Note**: Face 6 ( JAM) = 0 value for tactical unpredictability

---

### How to Roll Attack Dice

1. **Calculate To-Hit Target Number** (see Section 3 below)
2. **Roll 2 Attack Dice**
3. **Add both values together**
4. **Compare total to target number**

---

### Hit Result Table

| Total | Result | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **2** (double ) | **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE** | Weapon jams: discard all Primary Weapon cards from hand, +2 Heat, next attack -2 damage |
| **3-4** | **Miss** (if target 5+) | No damage, attack wasted |
| **5-6** | **Hit** | Standard damage from attack card |
| **7-8** | **Strong Hit** | Standard damage **+1** |
| **9** | **Critical Hit** | Standard damage **+2**, bypass 1 Defense |
| **10** (double ) | **EXECUTION** | Auto-destroy 1 Component, bypass ALL Defense |

**Example Rolls**:
- (3) + (5) = **8 total** → Strong Hit (+1 damage)
- (5) + (5) = **10 total** → **EXECUTION** (instant component destruction)
- (0) + (0) = **2 total** → **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE** (weapon jams)

---

### Special Roll Outcomes

**EXECUTION (Double , total 10)**:
- Automatically destroy 1 targeted component (even if <3 Component Damage)
- Bypass ALL Defense (shields, armor, reactive cards don't work)
- Still deal standard damage from attack card
- Defender cannot choose to discard from hand (must discard from deck)
- **Brutality**: Even a 1-damage attack with EXECUTION destroys a component

**CATASTROPHIC FAILURE (Double , total 2)**:
- Your weapon critically malfunctions
- Discard all Primary Weapon cards from hand immediately
- Gain +2 Heat (weapon overheats from malfunction)
- Next attack this turn or next turn: -2 damage
- **Does NOT end your turn** (can still move, use Universal cards)

**Example**:
- Church Confessor attacks with Faithful Thrust (4 damage)
- Rolls: (0) + (0) = **2 total** (Catastrophic Failure)
- Must discard all Penitent Blade cards from hand
- Gains 2 Heat
- Next attack -2 damage
- **Can still move, use Buckler Shield, or pass turn**

---

## 2. Defense Dice (Variable, 1d6 per damage)

### Die Face Symbols

| Face | Symbol | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | | **SHIELD** - Block 1 damage |
| 2 | | **ABSORB** - Block 1 damage |
| 3 | | **FLESH WOUND** - Take damage (discard 1 card) |
| 4 | | **CRITICAL** - Take damage + 1 Component Damage |
| 5 | | **PIERCE** - Take damage, cannot use reactive cards |
| 6 | | **HEAT** - Take damage + 1 Heat |

---

### How to Roll Defense Dice

1. **Attacker's attack hits** → Determine damage amount
2. **Defender rolls 1 Defense Die per damage point**
 - Example: 6 damage = roll 6 Defense Dice
3. **Count SHIELD and ABSORB symbols**
 - Each blocks 1 damage
4. **Apply special effects** from other symbols
5. **Final damage = Original damage - Total blocks**

**Block Probability**: 2/6 faces block (, ) = **33% chance per die**

---

### Defense Die Effects

** SHIELD (Face 1)**:
- Blocks 1 damage
- No side effects
- Most reliable defense

** ABSORB (Face 2)**:
- Blocks 1 damage
- Represents armor plating absorbing hit
- No side effects

** FLESH WOUND (Face 3)**:
- Take 1 damage (no block)
- Standard hit, no special effects

** CRITICAL (Face 4)**:
- Take 1 damage (no block)
- **+1 Component Damage to targeted component**
- Stacks with Component Damage from discarding Primary Weapon cards
- **Example**: Roll 3 Defense Dice, get = +3 Component Damage (instant destruction)

** PIERCE (Face 5)**:
- Take 1 damage (no block)
- **Cannot use reactive defense cards** (shield blocks, parries, etc.)
- Represents armor-piercing hit
- Disable reactive cards for THIS damage instance only

** HEAT (Face 6)**:
- Take 1 damage (no block)
- **+1 Heat**
- Can trigger Strain roll if pushed into Danger Zone (5+ Heat)

---

### Defense Dice Example

**Setup**: Dwarven Heavy takes **8 damage** from Church attack

**Step 1**: Roll 8 Defense Dice
- Result: 

**Step 2**: Count Blocks
- **3 Shield symbols ()** = Block 3 damage
- Reduced from 8 → **5 damage**

**Step 3**: Apply Special Effects
- **2 Critical symbols ()** = +2 Component Damage to targeted component
- **1 Heat symbol ()** = +1 Heat
- **1 Pierce symbol ()** = Cannot use reactive defense cards

**Step 4**: Defender Chooses Discard
- Must discard 5 cards (chooses 3 from hand, 2 from deck)
- If any Primary Weapon cards discarded → Add to Component Damage

**Step 5**: Final Component Damage
- 2 (from ) + 1 (from 1 Primary Weapon card discarded) = **3 Component Damage**
- **Component DESTROYED** (reached threshold)

---

### Statistical Breakdown

**Defense Die Probabilities**:
- Block ( or ): 2/6 = **33.3%**
- Standard damage (): 1/6 = **16.7%**
- Critical damage (): 1/6 = **16.7%**
- Pierce (): 1/6 = **16.7%**
- Heat (): 1/6 = **16.7%**

**Expected Blocks per Damage**:
- 3 damage = ~1 block (33%)
- 6 damage = ~2 blocks (33%)
- 9 damage = ~3 blocks (33%)

**Variance**:
- Lucky roll: 6 damage, roll 6 blocks (all /) = **0 damage taken**
- Unlucky roll: 6 damage, roll 0 blocks (all ) = **6 damage + penalties**

---

## 3. To-Hit Modifier System

### Base To-Hit Number

**Default**: **5+** (roll 2d6 Attack Dice, total must equal or exceed 5)

---

### Range Modifiers

| Range | Modifier | Final Target |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Short (0-3 hexes)** | +0 | 5+ |
| **Medium (4-6 hexes)** | +1 | 6+ |
| **Long (7-10 hexes)** | +2 | 7+ |
| **Extreme (11+ hexes)** | +3 | 8+ |

---

### Movement Modifiers (Attacker)

| Hexes Moved This Turn | Modifier |
|-----------------------|----------|
| **0 (Stationary)** | +0 |
| **1-3** | +1 |
| **4-6** | +2 |
| **7+ (Sprint)** | +3 |

**Note**: Applies to attacker's movement during their current turn

---

### Movement Modifiers (Defender)

| Hexes Moved Last Turn | Modifier |
|-----------------------|----------|
| **0 (Stationary)** | +0 |
| **1-3** | +1 |
| **4-6** | +2 |
| **7+ (Sprint)** | +3 |

**Note**: Applies to defender's movement during their previous turn

---

### Hex-Side Facing Modifiers

| Hex Side | Arc Name | Modifier | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| **1** (Front) | Front Arc | +0 | Standard defense |
| **2** (Front-Right) | Weapon Side | +0 | +1 damage if hit (vulnerable) |
| **3** (Rear-Right) | Flank (Weapon) | -1 (easier) | Exposed flank |
| **4** (Rear) | Rear Arc | -2 (easier) | Blind spot, +3 damage if hit |
| **5** (Rear-Left) | Flank (Shield) | -1 (easier) | Rear flank |
| **6** (Front-Left) | Shield Side | +1 (harder) | Shield protection, +1 Defense if hit |

**Facing Diagram**:
```
 [1] 1 = FRONT (hardest to hit)
 [6] [X] [2] 2 = WEAPON SIDE (vulnerable, +1 damage)
 [5] [3] 3-5 = FLANKS (easier to hit)
 [4] 4 = REAR (easiest, +3 damage)
 6 = SHIELD SIDE (harder, +1 Defense)
X = Your Casket
```

---

### Terrain Modifiers

| Terrain | Modifier | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Open Ground** | +0 | No cover |
| **Light Cover** (rubble, low walls) | +1 | Partial concealment |
| **Heavy Cover** (fortress walls, forest) | +2 | Significant obstruction |
| **Obscured** (smoke, darkness) | +2 | Limited visibility |
| **Elevated** (attacker on high ground) | -1 (easier) | Height advantage |

**Stacking**: Multiple terrain modifiers can apply
- Example: Target in forest (+2) AND obscured by smoke (+2) = **+4 total**

---

### Complete To-Hit Calculation Example

**Scenario**:
- Church Scout (attacker) shoots Dwarven Heavy (defender) with pistol
- Range: 5 hexes (Medium)
- Scout moved 4 hexes this turn (aggressive advance)
- Dwarf moved 2 hexes last turn (repositioning)
- Attacking Dwarf's **shield-side (hex 6)**
- Dwarf is behind light cover (rubble)

**Calculation**:
1. Base: 5+
2. Range (Medium, 5 hexes): +1 → **6+**
3. Attacker moved 4 hexes: +1 → **7+**
4. Defender moved 2 hexes: +1 → **8+**
5. Shield-side facing: +1 → **9+**
6. Light cover: +1 → **10+**

**Final To-Hit**: **10+** (only possible with double EXECUTION roll)

**Attack Roll**: (5) + (3) = **8 total**
**Result**: **MISS** (needed 10+, got 8)

## 4. VERSION 3.0 OPTIONAL: Dice Pool Advantage/Disadvantage

> **v3.0 OPTIONAL MECHANIC**: Instead of static +1/+2 modifiers, use Dice Pool system. See [dice-pool-advantage.md](dice-pool-advantage.md) for full rules.

**Quick Summary**:

### Advantage (Roll 3d6, take 2 highest)
- **Use when**: Target has favorable conditions (flanking, rear arc, high ground)
- **Effect**: +17% hit chance, more dramatic critical hits
- **Example**: Flanking attack (old: -1 modifier) → Roll 3d6, take 2 highest

### Disadvantage (Roll 3d6, take 2 lowest)
- **Use when**: Target has unfavorable conditions (long range, heavy cover, sprinting)
- **Effect**: -17% hit chance, more dramatic failures
- **Example**: Long range attack (old: +2 modifier) → Roll 3d6, take 2 lowest

### Critical Advantage/Disadvantage (Roll 4d6, take 2 highest/lowest)
- **Critical Advantage**: Triple EXECUTION chance (from 2.78% to ~8%)
- **Critical Disadvantage**: Severe penalty situations (extreme range + cover + sprint)

### Conversion Table

| Old Modifier | v3.0 Dice Pool |
|--------------|----------------|
| -2 or better | **Critical Advantage** (4d6 take 2 highest) |
| -1 | **Advantage** (3d6 take 2 highest) |
| 0 | Standard roll (2d6) |
| +1 | **Disadvantage** (3d6 take 2 lowest) |
| +2 or worse | **Critical Disadvantage** (4d6 take 2 lowest) |

**Design Philosophy**: Dice Pool system creates more dramatic swings (big crits, big failures) while maintaining same average hit chances. Inspired by Trench Crusade's Blood Marker system.

## 7. Quick Reference: What Dice to Roll When

### During Attack

1. **Declare attack** → Calculate To-Hit target number
2. **Roll 2 Attack Dice** → Add values, compare to target
3. **If hit** → Defender rolls Defense Dice (1 per damage)
4. **Apply damage** → Defender discards cards

### During Defense

2. **Roll X Defense Dice** (X = damage)
3. **Count blocks** ( and )
4. **Apply special effects** ( )
5. **Discard final damage** (original - blocks)

### Church Self-Harm

4. **Make next attack** (with bonus if applicable)

---

## 4. Damage Die (1d6)

### When to Roll

**Roll Damage Die when a DAMAGED card is removed:**

1. **Sacrifice Action** (0 SP): Discard DAMAGED to Discard Pile → Roll Damage Die
2. **Purge Action** (0 SP): Discard DAMAGED to Damage Graveyard → Roll Damage Die
3. **Discarded by Damage**: DAMAGED card discarded when taking damage → Roll Damage Die (cascading failure)

### Die Face Results

| Face | Symbol | Result | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 🔥 | **Minor Strain** | Gain 1 Heat |
| 2 | ⚠️ | **System Glitch** | -1 SP at start of next turn |
| 3 | 💔 | **Internal Bleeding** | Discard 1 card (to Damage Graveyard) at start of next turn |
| 4 | 🛡️ | **Structural Weakness** | Next attack against you: +1 Component Damage |
| 5 | 💀 | **Critical Malfunction** | +1 Pilot Wound immediately |
| 6 | ⚡ | **Adrenaline Surge** | Gain 1 SP immediately (the lucky outcome!) |

---

### Strategic Use

**When to Sacrifice vs Purge:**

**Sacrifice (to Discard Pile):**
- Wound comes back after reshuffle
- Use when: Early game, plenty of HP, need hand space temporarily
- Risk: DAMAGED card cycles back into deck in 3-5 turns

**Purge (to Damage Graveyard):**
- Wound removed permanently
- Use when: Late game, low HP, want to reduce death spiral
- Benefit: One less dead draw in your deck forever

**When to Keep:**
- Hoping to avoid damage until end of combat
- Hand isn't clogged yet (only 1-2 DAMAGED cards)
- Waiting for opportune moment (low Heat, high HP)
- Gambling on rolling Adrenaline Surge when you need SP

---

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Early Sacrifice**
- Turn 2, drew DAMAGED card, still at 26/30 HP
- Player: "I'll Sacrifice it now" → Roll Damage Die → Get "Minor Strain" (+1 Heat)
- DAMAGED goes to Discard Pile → Will reshuffle in ~4 turns
- Hand freed up, can draw useful cards

**Scenario 2: Late Purge**
- Turn 8, down to 12 HP, drew DAMAGED card
- Player: "I'm Purging this permanently" → Roll Damage Die → Get "System Glitch" (-1 SP next turn)
- DAMAGED goes to Damage Graveyard → Gone forever
- Reduces death spiral, worth the -1 SP penalty

**Scenario 3: Cascading Failure**
- Turn 5, have DAMAGED in hand, decide to keep it
- Take 4 damage, one discarded card is DAMAGED → Roll Damage Die
- Roll: "Critical Malfunction" (+1 Pilot Wound)
- The wound you ignored just caused a Pilot injury!
