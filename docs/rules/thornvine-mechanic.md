# Thornvine Mechanic (Elves Faction)

**"The forest remembers. The forest hungers."**

The Elves faction uses **Thornvine seeds** to control the battlefield through plant summons. Instead of dealing damage-over-time like other factions, Elves plant seeds that grow into dangerous plant creatures.

## Core Mechanic: Thornvine Seeds

### Planting Seeds

Certain Elves attacks and abilities **plant Thornvine seeds** in hexes:
- Seeds are placed in the **target's hex** (where the enemy is standing)
- Seeds can also be placed in **empty hexes** with area effects
- **Max 4 seeds per hex**
- Seeds are persistent (don't disappear between turns)
- Seeds are **neutral** (not owned by either player)

**Cards that Plant Seeds:**
- **Thorn Strike**: Plant 2 seeds in target hex
- **Root Bind**: Plant 2 seeds + immobilize
- **Thorn Blade Slash**: Plant 2 seeds (equipment)
- **Vine Whip Lash**: Plant 1 seed (ranged)
- **Wild Growth**: Plant 1 seed in all hexes within 2 of you

---

### Sprouting Plant Creatures

When a hex reaches **3+ seeds**, it can **sprout** into a plant creature:

| Seeds | Sprout Trigger | Plant Type |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| 3 seeds | Automatic at end of round | **Thornvine Snare** |
| 3 seeds | Manual (Overgrowth card) | **Thornvine Snare** (immediate) |
| 4 seeds | Automatic at end of round | **Bramble Sentinel** |
| 3 seeds + kill | When Elves kill enemy | **Spore Bloom** |

**Sprouting Rules:**
- Automatic sprouting happens at **end of Elves turn**
- Manual sprouting uses the **Overgrowth** card (3 SP)
- Sprouting **consumes all seeds** in that hex
- Plant appears immediately in that hex
- If hex is occupied, plant spawns in adjacent hex (Elves' choice)

## Strategic Gameplay

### Seed Management

**Building Up Seeds:**
1. Use ranged attacks to plant seeds safely
2. Wild Growth to blanket an area with 1 seed each
3. Focus fire one hex to reach 3-4 seeds quickly
4. Thorn Strike + Root Bind = 4 seeds in one hex (instant Bramble Sentinel)

**Spending Seeds:**
- **Nature's Wrath**: Detonate ALL seeds for 2 damage/seed (max 8/hex)
- **Overgrowth**: Convert 3+ seeds into immediate Thornvine Snare
- **Auto-Sprout**: Wait for end of turn, automatic plant

**Seed Placement Strategy:**
- Plant seeds on **objectives** (force enemies to fight plants)
- Plant seeds in **choke points** (create walls)
- Plant seeds on **wounded enemies** (finish with Nature's Wrath)
- Plant seeds on **fast enemies** (Thornvine Snare slows them)

---

### Combo Plays

**The Trap:**
1. Root Bind enemy (2 seeds + immobilize)
2. Thorn Strike (2 more seeds = 4 total)
3. Auto-sprout Bramble Sentinel at end of turn
4. Enemy trapped with -2 Movement + takes damage

**The Detonation:**
1. Wild Growth (spread 1 seed in 2-hex radius)
2. Multiple attacks stack seeds in 1 hex
3. Nature's Wrath (detonate all seeds)
4. Deal 2-8 damage per hex across battlefield

**The Wall:**
1. Plant 3 seeds in line of hexes
2. Auto-sprout Thornvine Snares
3. Create impassable barrier
4. Enemies must destroy plants or go around

---

## Counterplay

**Enemy Options:**

**Destroy Plants:**
- Plants have low HP (3-6)
- Attack plants to remove them
- Prevents ongoing effects

**Avoid Seeded Hexes:**
- Don't stand in hexes with 2+ seeds
- Move before plants sprout
- Deny Elves their combo

**Spread Out:**
- Nature's Wrath hurts grouped enemies
- Stay 2+ hexes apart
- Reduces seed concentration

**Pressure Elves:**
- Elves need time to stack seeds
- Aggressive rush disrupts setup
- Kill Elves before plants matter

## Balance Notes

### Power Level vs Bleed

**Old Bleed Mechanic:**
- Stack 1-4 counters on enemy
- Deal 1-4 damage/turn automatically
- Simple, passive damage

**New Thornvine Mechanic:**
- Plant 1-4 seeds on battlefield
- Seeds spawn plant creatures
- Plants provide utility (immobilize, defense, area damage)

**Comparison:**
- **Bleed**: Guaranteed damage, no counterplay
- **Thornvine**: Higher potential (plants + damage), but enemies can destroy plants
- **Skill Ceiling**: Thornvine rewards positioning and timing
- **Interactivity**: Enemies can respond to plants

**Expected WR:** Elves remain at ~52% (balanced)

---

## Design Philosophy

**Why Thornvine?**

1. **More Thematic**: Forest elves summon nature, not bleed
2. **More Interactive**: Enemies can destroy plants
3. **More Strategic**: Seed placement and timing matter
4. **More Visual**: Plants on battlefield create story moments
5. **More Fun**: Summoning creatures > stacking counters

**Nature Fantasy:**
- Elves don't just fight, they **grow**
- Battlefield becomes a **living ecosystem**
- Enemies fight **two opponents** (Elves + Plants)
- Late game = **forest of thorns**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I plant seeds in empty hexes?**
A: Yes, with Wild Growth. Most attacks require a target.

**Q: Do seeds disappear if I kill the Elf player?**
A: No. Seeds and plants persist until destroyed or they wither.

**Q: Can allies move through plant hexes?**
A: Yes, but it's difficult terrain (+1 SP). Plants don't damage allies.

**Q: Can I target my own seeds with Nature's Wrath?**
A: Yes, but it only damages enemies. Friendly fire doesn't apply to detonation.

**Q: What happens if 2 hexes have 3 seeds at end of turn?**
A: Both sprout. Elves can have multiple plants active.

**Q: Can Spore Bloom be destroyed before it detonates?**
A: Yes! It only has 3 HP. Smart enemies will kill it.

**Q: Do Thornvine Snares stack?**
A: No. If you sprout a second snare in same hex, old one is destroyed.
