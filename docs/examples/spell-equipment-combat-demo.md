**MVP Card**: **Pillar of Light** - 6 damage Armor-Piercing execution of Mortis
**Key Cards Used**:
- Holy Fire: 7 damage (with Blessing buff)
- Sanctuary: Defensive zone control
- Mass Healing: Team-wide recovery

**Effectiveness**: 9/10 - Versatile offensive + support capabilities

---

### Codex of Light (Brother Kael)

**Key Cards Used**:
- Radiant Bolt: Consistent ranged damage with corruption bonus
- Blessing: Force multiplication on allies
- Consecrated Ground: Area denial + sustain

**Effectiveness**: 8/10 - Excellent support + consistent damage

---

### Staff of the Grave (Mortis)
**MVP Card**: **Death Wave** - 4 damage AoE with 2 damage splash (wounded 2 enemies)
**Weakness**: Mortis eliminated before using Plague, Corpse Explosion, or Lich Form

**Effectiveness**: 6/10 - High potential but died too quickly

---

### Necromancer's Grimoire (Selene)
**MVP Card**: **Raise Dead** - Created Skeleton Minion that survived owner's death
**Key Cards Used**:
- Soul Drain: Lifesteal sustained Selene through early combat
- Wither: Damage-over-time curse on Templar (dealt 3 damage total over 3 rounds)

---

## Tactical Observations

1. **Spell Equipment Viability**: Magic users traded consistent damage for utility
   - Healing, buffs, terrain control added strategic depth
   - AoE damage competitive with physical weapons

2. **Resource Management**: SP costs (1-4) well-balanced
   - Light spells (1-2 SP): Efficient, spammable
   - Medium spells (3 SP): Tactical choices
   - Heavy spells (4-5 SP): Turn-defining plays

3. **School Synergies**:
   - **Light/Holy**: Anti-corruption + team support (excellent vs Ossuarium)
   - **Death/Necromancy**: Lifesteal + minion persistence created attrition game

4. **Counterplay**:
   - Sanctuary blocked Juggernaut's advance
   - Consecrated Ground provided healing/defense vs sustained assault
   - Raise Dead created value even after caster death

---

## Conclusion

Spell equipment adds **meaningful tactical choices** without overpowering physical weapons. The 7-card Heavy staves compete with Greatswords/Rifles, while medium grimoires match Crossbows/Longswords in card count.

**Balance Rating**: ✅ **Well-balanced** - Spells trade raw damage for utility, with comparable SP efficiency to physical weapons.
