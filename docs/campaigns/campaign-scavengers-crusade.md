---

## Campaign Overview

### The Hook
Your settlement has survived for 50 years on the edge of the Sibarian Wastes, scavenging Soulstones from the ruins. But recent expeditions report strange signals emanating from deeper within the Wastes—pulsing patterns that match no known Abomination signature.

The Council has authorized a deep expedition. Your mission: reach the source of the signals, claim whatever Soulstones you find, and return alive. Simple. Except nothing in the Wastes is ever simple.

### The Truth (GM Knowledge)
The signals come from a **backup research facility** that Dr. Theslar built as insurance. It contains:
- Experimental Soulstones (3× more powerful, but 3× more corrupting)
- Theslar's personal research notes (could affect The Engine itself)
- Automated defenses (still active after 437 years)
- Something else... something that **shouldn't be awake**

Three other factions have detected the signals:
- **Church of Absolution**: Wants to destroy the facility (heretical research)
- **Dwarven Forge-Guilds**: Wants to secure the research (engineering data)
- **The Wyrd Conclave (Fae)**: Wants to corrupt it (opportunity for mischief)

Your choices will determine:
- Which faction becomes your ally vs enemy
- Whether the research is destroyed, used, or kept
- The fate of your settlement
- The stability of The Engine itself

### Victory Conditions
- **Primary**: Complete Mission 10 (any outcome)
- **Secondary**: Keep settlement population above 50
- **Tertiary**: Keep at least 2 pilots alive with <8 total scars

### Defeat Conditions
- **Settlement Destroyed**: Population reaches 0
- **Total Party Kill**: All pilots dead/corrupted (10+ Taint)
- **The Engine Explodes** (Mission 10 bad ending): Campaign world ends

---

##  Mission 1: "Strangers at the Gates"
**Act 1 - Establishment**

### Setup
As your pilots prepare for the expedition, a group of armed scavengers attacks your settlement's outer walls. They're not Abominations—they're **desperate humans**, starving and armed with crude weapons.

**Map**: Settlement Perimeter (12×12 hexes)
**Enemies**: 8× Corrupted Villagers (Swarm, 5 HP each), 1× Bandit Raider (Elite, 15 HP)
**Objective**: Defend the gate for 6 turns OR eliminate all enemies

### Special Rules
- **Civilian Casualties**: If enemies reach gate hex (center of map), roll 1d6. On 1-3, lose 1d6 settlement population.
- **Capture Alive**: If Bandit Raider reduced to 5 HP or below, players can attempt to capture (Willpower Save, DC 4+). Success = prisoner for Mission 2.

### Rewards
- **Success**: 100 Credits, 2d6 Scrap, +10 Morale
- **Capture Raider**: Unlock Mission 2 interrogation scene
- **Zero Casualties**: +20 Morale bonus

### Consequences
- **Failure**: Settlement loses 2d6 population, -20 Morale, gate damaged (costs 50 Credits + 10 Scrap to repair before Mission 3)
- **High Casualties**: Settlement Event "Mass Funeral" triggers between missions

### Story Beats
- Bandits shout: "The signals! We need the stones! Let us through or we ALL die!"
- Raider carries a crude map showing the same signal source you're tracking
- If interrogated (Mission 2): Reveals a **rival faction** is also hunting the signals

---

## Mission 2: "The Prisoner's Tale"
**Act 1 - Establishment**

### Setup
*(Only available if Bandit Raider was captured in Mission 1. If not, skip to Mission 3.)*

The captured raider, **Kess the Vulture**, agrees to talk in exchange for medical treatment and release. She reveals:
- She works for a mercenary company called **The Branded** (Nomad renegades)
- They were hired by an anonymous client to secure "pre-Cataclysm research" from the Wastes
- The signals aren't natural—something inside the ruins is **calling for help**
- Three other factions know about it: Church, Dwarves, and "something that doesn't show on maps" (Fae)

**Choice Point**: What do you do with Kess?

### Option A: Kill Her
- **Immediate**: Gain +50 Credits (bounty), +5 Morale (eliminated threat)
- **Long-term**: The Branded become permanent enemies (hostile encounters in Mission 6+)
- **Mission 10 Impact**: The Branded attack settlement during finale

### Option B: Free Her (With Conditions)
- **Immediate**: Kess provides detailed map (+1 free reroll per mission for navigation)
- **Long-term**: The Branded remain neutral (won't help, won't hinder)
- **Mission 10 Impact**: Kess returns to warn you of incoming Church crusade (+1 turn prep time)

### Option C: Recruit Her
- **Immediate**: Kess joins as NPC ally (Nomad Scout, 20 HP, 5 SP, fast movement)
- **Long-term**: Settlement gains "Branded Sympathizer" trait (can trade with Nomad Collective)
- **Mission 10 Impact**: Kess sacrifices herself to save a pilot (negates 1 pilot death)
- **Risk**: If Kess dies in Mission 4-9, The Branded declare vendetta (hostile encounters)

### GM Note
**Recommended choice**: Option B or C. Creates interesting long-term consequences without punishing players too harshly.

### Story Beats
- Kess is scarred, cynical, but not evil—just trying to survive
- She respects strength: "You could have killed me. Why didn't you?"
- Foreshadowing: "Whatever's in those ruins... it's been waiting 437 years. It can wait a little longer."

## Mission 3: "Into the Grey"
**Act 1 - The Hook**

### Setup
Your expedition enters the outer Sibarian Wastes. Reality is already "soft" here—gravity fluctuates, time feels wrong, distant screams echo from nowhere.

**Map**: Wasteland Ruins (16×16 hexes, difficult terrain)
**Enemies**: 3× Scrap Drones (Swarm Construct, 4 HP), 6× Tainted Rat Swarm (3 HP each), **BOSS:** 1× Tainted Ogre (Elite, 25 HP)
**Objective**: Reach the facility entrance (far side of map) within 8 turns

### Special Rules
- **Void Exposure**: At start of each turn, all pilots gain +1 Taint (cannot be prevented). Mission cap: +8 Taint total.
- **Signal Interference**: Pilots cannot communicate beyond 6 hexes (no coordinated actions)
- **The Pulse**: Every 3 turns, The Engine pulses. All pilots roll Strain (1d6, on 1-2 lose 1 SP).

### Soulstone Cache Discovery
Halfway through mission, players find a **Soulstone deposit** (3× Experimental Soulstones, glowing sickly purple).

**Choice Point**: Do you take them?

#### Option A: Take the Soulstones (Greedy)
- **Immediate**: Gain 3× Experimental Soulstones (+3 damage, +3 Defense when equipped, but +1 Taint per turn)
- **Mission 5 Impact**: Soulstones corrupt settlement (trigger "Taint Outbreak" event, lose 1d6 population)
- **Mission 10 Path**: Unlocks "Exploit Engine" ending (power at any cost)

#### Option B: Leave Them (Cautious)
- **Immediate**: No bonus
- **Mission 5 Impact**: Settlement remains clean
- **Mission 10 Path**: Unlocks "Destroy Engine" ending (redemption path)

#### Option C: Take One, Leave Two (Balanced)
- **Immediate**: Gain 1× Experimental Soulstone (same corruption risk, but only 1 pilot affected)
- **Mission 5 Impact**: Mild settlement corruption (lose 1d3 population, manageable)
- **Mission 10 Path**: Unlocks all endings (player choice preserved)

### Rewards
- **Success**: Reach facility entrance, +200 Credits, 3d6 Scrap, access to Mission 4
- **Optional**: Experimental Soulstones (if taken)
- **Speed Bonus**: Complete in 6 turns or less = +50 Credits

### Consequences
- **Failure**: Forced to retreat, lose 1d6 Scrap, Mission 4 becomes harder (enemy reinforcements)
- **High Taint**: Any pilot reaching 6+ Taint during this mission gains Corruption Scar (roll on table)

### Story Beats
- Ruins show signs of **recent occupation** (campfires, discarded rations)—someone else is here
- Tainted Ogre has Church iconography on its armor—it was human once
- As you reach facility entrance, you hear **machinery humming inside**—something is still powered

---

## Mission 4: "What Lies Beneath"
**Act 2 - Escalation Begins**

### Setup
You descend into the research facility. Lights flicker on as you enter—emergency power is still active after 437 years. Automated turrets pivot toward you. Klaxons blare. A synthesized voice: *"Intruder alert. Lockdown Protocol Sigma activated. Lethal force authorized."*

**Map**: Research Facility Level 1 (12×14 hexes, indoor corridors)
**Enemies**: 4× Scrap Drones (4 HP each), 2× Scrap Golems (Elite Construct, 20 HP, 4 Armor), **BOSS:** 1× Automated Defense Grid (Environmental Hazard Boss)
**Objective**: Disable the Defense Grid (center of map) OR survive 8 turns

### Special Rules
- **Turret Fire**: At end of each turn, Defense Grid attacks all pilots in LOS for 3d6 damage (ignores cover)
- **EMP Blast**: Every 3 turns, Defense Grid pulses EMP (all pilots lose 2 SP, Constructs heal 1 card)
- **Lockdown**: Doors seal randomly (1d6 each turn, on 1-2 a door locks, on 5-6 a door unlocks)

### Mid-Mission Twist
After 4 turns (or when Defense Grid reaches 50% HP), a second group breaches from opposite entrance:

**3× Church Zealots (Elite, 18 HP each)** led by **Inquisitor Marius** (NPC Boss, 25 HP, Church faction)

Marius demands: *"Stand down, heretics! This facility is an abomination! We will purge it with fire!"*

**Choice Point**: Do you ally with the Church, fight them, or avoid them?

#### Option A: Ally with Church
- Church Zealots become temporary allies for rest of mission
- After mission: Church offers alliance (trade access, -20% Equipment costs)
- Mission 10 Impact: Church supports you in finale (reinforcements arrive)
- **Trade-off**: Must promise to destroy all research (locks out "Exploit Engine" ending)

#### Option B: Fight the Church
- Church Zealots hostile (3v3 + Defense Grid = brutal)
- After mission: Church declares you heretics (hostile encounters Mission 7+)
- Mission 10 Impact: Church crusade attacks settlement during finale
- **Trade-off**: Keep freedom to choose any ending, but harder path

#### Option C: Negotiate Truce
- Willpower Save (DC 5+) to convince Marius to work together temporarily
- Success: Church helps disable Grid, leaves peacefully, remains neutral
- Failure: Combat starts anyway (same as Option B)
- Mission 10 Impact: Church stays out of finale (neutral)

### Rewards
- **Success**: Access to Level 2 (Mission 5), 300 Credits, 4d6 Scrap, 1× Soulstone Fragment
- **Disable Grid Intact**: Gain "Security Protocols" research (+1 Defense to settlement)
- **Church Alliance**: Unlock Church equipment shop

### Consequences
- **Failure**: Facility self-destructs (Mission 5 must be different location), lose all research
- **Church Hostile**: Enemy encounters increase, settlement under Inquisition scrutiny

### Story Beats
- Computer terminals show research logs: **Dr. Theslar was trying to UNDO the Cataclysm** before he vanished
- One terminal flickers: *"Failsafe Protocol Active. Containment Breach imminent. Days since activation: 159,505"*
- Marius shouts: "This heresy must end! The past should stay buried!"
- Final terminal before Level 2 access: *"Warning: Subject Sigma is awake. Recommend immediate evacuation."*

---

## Mission 5: "The Compromise"
**Act 2 - Moral Choice Crystalizes**

### Setup
You've reached Research Level 2—Theslar's personal laboratory. Intact Soulstone research, working computers, prototype equipment. And in the center: a **containment chamber** holding a pulsing, crystalline mass—*an artificial Soulstone the size of a Casket*, radiating immense power and Taint.

Computer logs reveal the truth:
- Theslar created this prototype to **stabilize The Engine**
- It works... but requires a "compatible catalyst" (living pilot's consciousness)
- Using it could shut down The Engine permanently
- Using it could also **kill the pilot and corrupt everything within 10 miles**

**Map**: Research Lab (10×12 hexes, tight corridors)
**Enemies**: None initially, but **consequences trigger mid-mission based on earlier choices**

###  Major Choice Point: The Prototype Soulstone

#### Option A: Destroy It (Redemption Path)
- Eliminate the prototype to prevent misuse
- **Immediate**: Gain +50 Morale, +reputation with Church and Elves
- **Mission 10 Setup**: "Destroy Engine" ending becomes default (manual sabotage)
- **Trade-off**: Lose immense power source, harder finale

#### Option B: Take It (Power Path)
- Extract the prototype for future use (Mission 10)
- **Immediate**: Gain "Sigma Prototype" (can be used once in Mission 10 for +10 damage to Engine HP OR to resurrect 1 dead pilot)
- **Settlement Impact**: Trigger "Taint Outbreak" event (lose 2d6 population, -30 Morale)
- **Mission 10 Setup**: "Control Engine" and "Exploit Engine" endings available
- **Trade-off**: Settlement suffers, moral corruption deepens

#### Option C: Study It (Knowledge Path)
- Leave it in place, download research data
- **Immediate**: Gain "Theslar's Notes" (unlock advanced crafting recipes, +1 SP to all pilots permanently)
- **Mission 8 Impact**: Dwarven Forge-Guilds offer alliance (heard you value knowledge)
- **Mission 10 Setup**: All endings available + unique "Stabilize Engine" option
- **Trade-off**: Dwarves AND Church both want the research (pressure from both sides)

### Complication: Rival Faction Arrival
Based on Mission 4 choice, 1 faction attacks:

- **If Church Hostile**: Inquisitor Marius + 4 Zealots assault lab
- **If Church Allied**: Dwarven Ironclad + 3 Runeforged warriors assault lab
- **If Church Neutral**: Fae Mockingbird + 2 Wyrdlings appear, offer "deal"

Combat is **optional**—players can negotiate, flee, or fight.

### Fae Deal (If Mockingbird appears)
Mockingbird offers: *"Take the prototype. We'll protect your settlement. All we ask... is a future favor."*

- Accept: Gain prototype + Fae protection (settlement immune to attacks Mission 6-9)
- **Cost**: Mission 10, Fae call in favor (must give them access to Engine research, enables "Fae Corruption" ending)
- Refuse: Mockingbird vanishes, Fae remain neutral

### Rewards
- **Success**: Escape with choice made, 400 Credits, 5d6 Scrap, +research notes/prototype/data
- **No Combat**: +100 Credits bonus (peaceful resolution)
- **Defeat Rival Faction**: +1 Legendary Loot roll

### Consequences
- **Prototype Destroyed**: Church and Elves approve, Dwarves and Fae disapprove
- **Prototype Taken**: Settlement corruption accelerates, Church hostility increases
- **Research Stolen**: All factions now hunting you (Mission 7+ pressure intensifies)

### Story Beats
- Theslar's final log: *"I understand now. The Engine doesn't just tear reality. It **hungers**. I tried to starve it. I failed. If anyone finds this... don't feed it."*
- If prototype destroyed: Energy surge destabilizes facility—escape becomes urgent
- If prototype taken: **Subject Sigma awakens** (teaser for Mission 6 boss)
- Regardless of choice: *"Containment Breach. Subject Sigma has escaped. Evacuate immediately."*

---

## Mission 6: "Consequences Cascade"
**Act 2 - Everything Gets Worse**

### Setup
You return to settlement to find **chaos**. Depending on Mission 5 choice:
- **Prototype Destroyed**: Church pilgrims arrived, demand you join crusade to destroy Engine (pressure)
- **Prototype Taken**: Settlement shows Taint corruption (sick civilians, reality fractures)
- **Research Kept**: Dwarven AND Church emissaries arrived, both demanding research (political crisis)

But that's not the worst part.

**Subject Sigma followed you home.**

**Map**: Settlement Defense (16×16 hexes, urban terrain)
**Enemies**: **BOSS:** Subject Sigma (Unique Abomination, 40 HP, 5 Armor, reality-bending attacks)
**Objective**: Survive 8 turns OR defeat Sigma before it reaches settlement core

### Subject Sigma - Boss Stats
- **HP**: 40 cards (Phase 1: 40-20 HP, Phase 2: 19-0 HP)
- **Movement**: 6 hexes (teleport, ignores terrain)
- **Armor**: 5 (Reality Ward—reduces all damage by 5 before Defense)
- **AI Deck**: 40 cards (mutations on reshuffle)

**Phase 1 Abilities:**
- *Void Strike* (×10): Attack 5d6 + inflict 2 Taint
- *Blink* (×8): Teleport 6 hexes, cannot be targeted until next turn
- *Harvest* (×6): Drain target for 4d6, heal self 2 cards
- *Dimensional Anchor* (×6): Target cannot move for 2 turns
- *Reality Fracture* (×5): Create Void Rift hex (3d6 damage to enter)
- *The Engine's Gift* (×5): Sigma heals 1 card per pilot with 5+ Taint nearby

**Phase 2 (Below 20 HP):**
- All attacks become 7d6 (powered by desperation)
- Gains *Taint Nova* (×5): AOE 4 hex radius, 5d6 + 3 Taint to all
- Gains *Resurrection Protocol* (×2): When reaching 0 HP first time, resurrect with 10 HP (once per battle)

### Special Rules
- **Civilian Evacuation**: Every 2 turns, roll 1d6. On 1-3, lose 1d6 population (Sigma is killing citizens)
- **Settlement Damage**: If Sigma reaches Core hex, settlement buildings take damage (lose 1d3 buildings randomly)
- **The Prototype**: If players took Sigma Prototype (Mission 5), can use it to **instantly kill Sigma** (but pilot using it gains 5 permanent Taint and Corruption Scar)

### Rewards
- **Defeat Sigma**: 600 Credits, 8d6 Scrap, +2 Legendary Loot rolls, +50 Morale
- **Protect Core**: Keep all settlement buildings intact (+30 Morale)
- **Zero Civilian Deaths**: Unlock "Hero of the Settlement" campaign bonus (+1 free Grit to all pilots)

### Consequences
- **Sigma Escapes**: Sigma flees into Wastes, becomes recurring boss (appears in Mission 9 finale)
- **High Casualties**: Lose 3d6 population, -2 Morale per 10 dead, trigger "Mass Exodus" event (survivors flee)
- **Core Destroyed**: Lose 2d3 buildings randomly, settlement crippled (harder Mission 7+)

### Story Beats
- Sigma shrieks in Theslar's voice: *"I tried to save them! Why won't it stop?!"*
- Mid-battle: Sigma pauses, confused—*"You're not... authorized personnel..."*
- Defeated: Sigma collapses, whispers: *"Thank you... I was so tired... 437 years... so tired..."*
- Final reveal: Sigma was **a failed prototype pilot**, trapped in containment for centuries, driven mad by isolation and Void exposure

---

## Mission 7: "Point of No Return"
**Act 2 - The Commitment**

### Setup
Your settlement is scarred but alive. Three factions converge with ultimatums:

1. **Church of Absolution** (If not hostile): "Join our crusade to destroy The Engine, or be declared heretics."
2. **Dwarven Forge-Guilds**: "Give us Theslar's research, or we cut off all trade and support."
3. **The Wyrd Conclave (Fae)**: "We've been watching. We offer power... for a price. Refuse, and we take what we need."

You must choose **ONE faction to ally with**. The others become hostile.

**This choice locks in your Mission 10 ending path.**

### Faction Alliance Consequences

#### Ally with Church (Destruction Path)
- **Benefits**: Church Zealots join Mission 8-10 as reinforcements, -20% healing costs, access to Church Tactics
- **Costs**: Must commit to destroying Engine (locks "Control" and "Exploit" endings)
- **Mission 10**: Church provides crusader army, guaranteed victory if you choose "Destroy Engine"

#### Ally with Dwarves (Stabilization Path)
- **Benefits**: Dwarven Ironclads join Mission 8-10, -30% crafting costs, unlock Dwarven Runic equipment
- **Costs**: Must give Dwarves the research (they will attempt to stabilize Engine)
- **Mission 10**: Dwarves provide engineering support, unlock "Stabilize Engine" ending

#### Ally with Fae (Exploitation Path)
- **Benefits**: Fae Wyrdlings join Mission 8-10, gain Fae Bargain (1 free resurrect per campaign), unlock Fae illusion abilities
- **Costs**: Owe Fae "future favor" (corrupts settlement, -20 Morale, +Taint events)
- **Mission 10**: Fae corrupt Engine to create permanent dimensional overlap (dark ending)

#### Refuse All Factions (Solo Path)
- **Benefits**: Keep independence, all endings remain available
- **Costs**: All factions become hostile, Mission 8-10 significantly harder, no reinforcements
- **Mission 10**: Solo assault on Engine, highest difficulty but most freedom

### Mission 7 Combat: The Gauntlet
To prove commitment to chosen faction, you must complete their trial:

**Church Trial**: "Purge the Heretics"
- Fight 6× Corrupted Villagers + 2× Tainted Ogres
- Objective: Eliminate all corruption (kill all enemies, no survivors)
- **Moral Cost**: Corrupted Villagers were **your former citizens** (refugees from earlier raids)

**Dwarven Trial**: "Recover the Artifact"
- Fight 4× Scrap Golems + 1× Dwarven Ironclad (rival clan)
- Objective: Secure ancient Dwarven artifact from contested ruins
- **Moral Cost**: Killing rival Dwarves damages inter-clan relations (permanent -1 reputation)

**Fae Trial**: "The Hunt"
- Fight 3× Elven Verdant Stalkers + 1× Ancient Treant
- Objective: Hunt and kill sacred forest guardian for Fae amusement
- **Moral Cost**: Killing Treant corrupts local forest (environmental consequences)

**Solo Trial** (If refusing all): "Survive the Onslaught"
- Fight mixed enemies from ALL factions (2 from each)
- Objective: Survive 8 turns OR defeat all enemies
- **Moral Cost**: Now marked as threat by everyone (permanent hostility)

### Rewards
- **Success**: Faction alliance locked in, +500 Credits, +faction-specific equipment, access to Mission 8
- **Church Path**: +3 Holy Relics, +30 Morale
- **Dwarven Path**: +Runic Weapons, +5d6 Scrap
- **Fae Path**: +Fae Bargain Tokens, +strange artifacts
- **Solo Path**: +Independence, +100 Morale ("We stand alone")

### Consequences
- **Non-Ally Factions**: Become permanently hostile (appear as enemies Mission 8+)
- **Church Hostile**: Inquisition crusades attack settlement between missions
- **Dwarves Hostile**: Trade embargo (-50% scrap generation, +100% crafting costs)
- **Fae Hostile**: Reality fractures, settlement suffers random Taint events

### Story Beats
- NPC ally (if Kess recruited Mission 2): Warns you—*"Whatever you choose, there's no going back. The wasteland remembers."*
- Faction representative speeches reveal their true motivations:
  - Church: "The Engine is a wound. We must cauterize it, even if it burns us all."
  - Dwarves: "We can fix this. We can fix EVERYTHING. Just give us the tools."
  - Fae: "Destruction? Salvation? Such limited thinking. We offer... transformation."
- End of mission: Distant explosion. The Engine's pulse frequency has changed. *Something is accelerating.*

---

## Mission 8: "The Gauntlet"
**Act 3 - Resolution Begins**

### Setup
With faction choice made, you must fight through the **Inner Sibarian Wastes** to reach The Engine itself. This is the most Taint-corrupted, reality-broken region on the planet.

**Map**: Wasteland Hellscape (18×18 hexes, extreme hazards)
**Enemies**: 6× Tainted Wolves (Swarm, 5 HP), 3× Engine Wraiths (Elite, 12 HP), 2× Faction Enemies (depends on alliances), **BOSS:** 1× Void Behemoth (Boss, 50 HP)
**Objective**: Reach Engine entrance (far side of map) within 10 turns

### Special Rules - EXTREME ENVIRONMENT
- **Constant Taint**: Gain +1 Taint every turn (no save, cannot prevent)
- **Reality Fractures**: Every 2 turns, 1d3 random hexes become Void Rifts (3d6 enter)
- **The Engine's Pulse**: Every 3 turns, all pilots roll Strain (1d6, on 1-3 lose 1 SP AND gain 1 Component Damage)
- **Gravity Distortion**: Movement costs vary (1d6 each hex: 1-2 = costs 0 SP, 3-4 = costs 1 SP, 5-6 = costs 2 SP)
- **Time Dilation**: Turns are unpredictable (GM rolls initiative for ALL units each turn)

### Faction Enemy Encounters
Based on Mission 7 choice, face enemies from non-ally factions:

- **Church**: 3× Church Zealots + 1× Inquisitor Marius (25 HP, boss)
- **Dwarves**: 2× Dwarven Ironclads + 1× Runeforged Champion (30 HP, boss)
- **Fae**: 3× Fae Wyrdlings + 1× Mockingbird (20 HP, illusion master)

If Solo Path (all hostile): Face enemies from **ALL THREE** factions (brutal, 9 enemies total)

### Void Behemoth Boss
- **HP**: 50 cards
- **Armor**: 8 (nearly impenetrable)
- **Movement**: 5 hexes (ignores terrain, can phase through walls)
- **Special**: Regenerates 2 cards per turn (must focus fire to kill)

**AI Deck (50 cards):**
- *Annihilation Beam* (×15): 6d6 ranged attack (10 hex range), ignores cover
- *Void Swarm* (×10): Summon 3 Tainted Rats per turn (swarming minions)
- *Reality Rend* (×8): AOE 3 hex radius, 5d6 + destroy 1 terrain hex permanently
- *Harvest Souls* (×7): Drain all pilots within 6 hexes for 3d6, heal equal to total damage dealt
- *Phase Out* (×5): Behemoth becomes untargetable for 1 turn (invulnerability)
- *The Engine's Blessing* (×5): All Abominations on field heal 3 cards

### Allied Reinforcements
If allied with faction, they provide support:

- **Church**: 4× Zealots arrive Turn 4 (draw aggro from Behemoth)
- **Dwarves**: 2× Ironclads arrive Turn 4 (tank Behemoth, high defense)
- **Fae**: 2× Wyrdlings arrive Turn 4 (debuff Behemoth, -2 Armor)
- **Solo**: No reinforcements (but +1 Legendary Loot for completing alone)

### Rewards
- **Success**: Reach Engine, +800 Credits, +10d6 Scrap, +3 Legendary Loot rolls
- **Defeat Behemoth**: +Void Behemoth Heart (crafting material: create 1 item that ignores armor)
- **No Ally Deaths**: +50 Morale (proved faction choice was right)

### Consequences
- **Failure**: Forced retreat, mission repeats (lose 1d6 Scrap + 1 week time, Engine instability increases)
- **High Taint**: Any pilot reaching 8+ Taint gains Major Corruption Scar (permanent -1 SP or lose 1 equipment slot)
- **Reinforcements Die**: Ally faction loses faith, provides less support in Mission 9-10

### Story Beats
- The Engine looms ahead—**miles high, pulsing with purple-black energy**, reality warps around it
- Allied faction leader speech:
  - Church: "For 437 years, this wound has festered. Today, we heal it. Or we die trying."
  - Dwarves: "Theslar was a fool, but his math was sound. We finish what he started."
  - Fae: "The Engine is beautiful. Let us make it... more interesting."
- Behemoth death: It screams in Theslar's voice—*"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry..."* (reveals Engine is sustained by Theslar's trapped consciousness)
- Approaching Engine: *"Warning: Instability at 87%. Cascade failure imminent. Estimated time to containment breach: 72 hours."*

---

## Mission 9: "The Betrayal"
**Act 3 - The Twist**

### Setup
You've reached The Engine's base. Automated defenses activate. But before you can advance...

**Your ally betrays you.**

### The Betrayal (Faction-Specific)

#### If Allied with Church:
Inquisitor Marius reveals: *"The Engine must be destroyed. And so must Theslar's research. And so must... you. You know too much. You've been corrupted. Forgive me."*

- Church turns hostile (Marius + 6 Zealots attack)
- Objective: Defeat Marius OR escape to Engine entrance

#### If Allied with Dwarves:
Runemaster Thorin reveals: *"We need the research. We need the Engine. We need... test subjects. Your exposure to the Wastes makes you perfect candidates."*

- Dwarves attempt to capture (not kill) pilots for experimentation
- Objective: Resist capture for 6 turns OR defeat Thorin

#### If Allied with Fae:
Mockingbird laughs: *"Oh, you sweet naive things. Did you think we'd let YOU control the Engine? No, no. You were pawns. But such entertaining pawns!"*

- Fae transform allies into illusions (reveal reinforcements were fake)
- Objective: Fight through illusions to reach real Mockingbird

#### If Solo Path:
No betrayal—but **Subject Sigma returns** (if not killed in Mission 6) as 60 HP upgraded boss, or **Rival Faction Leader ambushes** (whichever is more dramatic).

### Betrayal Combat
This is **NOT a boss fight to the death**—it's a **escape/survival encounter**.

**Victory Conditions:**
- Survive 6 turns (reach Engine entrance)
- Defeat faction leader (kills them permanently, ally faction collapses)
- Negotiate (Willpower Save DC 7+, convince them to honor alliance)

**Defeat Conditions:**
- All pilots captured/killed (Game Over)
- Engine countdown reaches 0 (Engine explodes, Campaign Over)

### Negotiation Path (Optional)
Players can attempt to salvage alliance:

- **Church**: Prove you'll destroy Engine (pass Willpower Save, promise destruction)
- **Dwarves**: Offer research freely (give up Theslar's Notes, keep alliance)
- **Fae**: Offer better bargain (sacrifice 1 pilot permanently to Fae service, rest go free)

Success = Alliance restored, Mission 10 easier
Failure = Combat continues

### Rewards
- **Success**: Reach Engine Core, +1000 Credits, +4 Legendary Loot rolls
- **Defeated Faction Leader**: +Title "Kingslayer", +faction-specific legendary weapon
- **Negotiated Peace**: Keep alliance benefits for Mission 10

### Consequences
- **Killed Ally Leader**: Faction collapses, no support in Mission 10, but +independent ending
- **Failed Escape**: Campaign ends (captured or killed)
- **Lost Pilots**: If 1+ pilot dies here, triggers "Desperate Stand" modifier for Mission 10 (harder finale)

### Story Beats
- Betrayal foreshadowed by earlier NPC warnings (Kess, if alive: "I told you not to trust factions.")
- Faction leader monologue reveals their true goals:
  - Church: "We lied. We've always known the truth. Destroying the Engine will kill millions. But millions already died. What's a few more for salvation?"
  - Dwarves: "You think we're neutral? We funded Theslar's research. We knew this would happen. We wanted the power."
  - Fae: "The Engine is the best thing that ever happened. Reality is negotiable now. Why would we ever close that door?"
- Engine countdown: *"Critical failure in 24 hours. Containment breach will affect planetary radius. Evacuation... impossible."*
- Final line: *"Warning: Core access granted. Dr. Theslar awaits."*

## Mission 10: "The Choice"
**Act 3 - The Finale**

### Setup
You stand before **The Engine's Core**—a miles-high cathedral of twisted metal, crackling energy, and **something alive**.

In the center, suspended in crystalline Soulstone: **Dr. Nikolas Theslar himself**, perfectly preserved, eyes open, aware.

He speaks directly into your mind: *"I've been awake for 437 years. Every second, I feel the world dying. I tried to save it. I failed. Now... you must choose. End my suffering. Or give me the chance to try again."*

**This is the finale. Your choice determines the campaign ending.**

---

### Ending 1: "Destroy the Engine" (Redemption)
**Requirements**: Reject Theslar's offer, destroy the Core

**Mission**: Fight through **automated defenses + Theslar's desperate last defense**

**Enemies**: 4× Scrap Golems, 2× Engine Wraiths, **FINAL BOSS:** Theslar's Casket ("The Thesis", 60 HP, 6 Armor, reality manipulation)

**Theslar Boss Fight:**
- **HP**: 60 cards (no phases, pure endurance fight)
- **Armor**: 6 (Reality Ward)
- **AI Deck**: 60 cards—mix of every enemy ability you've fought (Void Strikes, Harvests, Reality Fractures, Summons)
- **Special**: Every 3 turns, Theslar begs you to stop—*"Please... I can fix this... just let me try..."* (Willpower Save DC 6+ or lose 2 SP from guilt)

**Victory**: Destroy Theslar, plant explosives, escape before Engine explodes

**Campaign Ending**:
- **The Engine explodes.** Reality stabilizes. Void rifts seal. Abominations cease spawning.
- **Magic fades from the world.** Caskets become inert. Soulstones crumble. The age of Caskets ends.
- **Your settlement thrives.** Population grows, people rebuild, new era begins.
- **You retire.** Your pilots dismantle their Caskets and become farmers, teachers, leaders. They never forget what they sacrificed.
- **Epilogue**: 50 years later, the world is healing. Cities rise. A new generation knows peace. But veterans whisper: *"The Engine is gone. But scars remain."*

**Tone**: Bittersweet victory. You saved the world, but lost the power that defined you.

---

### Ending 2: "Control the Engine" (Power)
**Requirements**: Accept Theslar's offer, attempt to control the Engine

**Mission**: Merge 1 pilot's consciousness with Theslar to **become the new Engine operator**

**Choice**: Which pilot volunteers?
- Volunteering pilot is **removed from campaign permanently** (becomes part of Engine)
- Remaining pilots must defend the merging process (8 turns)

**Enemies**: 3× Church Crusaders, 3× Dwarven Saboteurs, 3× Fae Corruptors (ALL factions attack to stop you)

**Victory**: Pilot successfully merges with Engine, gains godlike control over reality

**Campaign Ending**:
- **The Engine stabilizes under new management.** You control Void rifts, Soulstone generation, reality distortions.
- **You become immortal tyrant.** Absolute power corrupts. Your settlement becomes capital of new empire.
- **Other factions submit or die.** Church crusades fail. Dwarves bend the knee. Fae negotiate.
- **Your sacrificed pilot whispers from the Engine**: *"I control everything. I see everything. And I am so alone."*
- **Epilogue**: 100 years later, you rule a unified world. But at what cost? The pilot in the Engine has forgotten their name. They've forgotten they were ever human. They are the Engine now. Forever.

**Tone**: Dark victory. You won everything, but lost yourself in the process.

### Ending 3: "Exploit the Engine" (Corruption)
**Requirements**: Use the Sigma Prototype (from Mission 5) to weaponize the Engine

**Mission**: Overload the Engine to grant infinite power, consequences be damned

**Warning**: Theslar screams—*"No! That will tear the barriers completely! The Void will consume EVERYTHING!"*

**Enemies**: 6× Void Abominations, **FINAL BOSS:** Reality Tear (Environmental Boss, infinite HP, must survive 10 turns)

**Survival Challenge**: Hold position for 10 turns while Engine overloads
- Every turn: Gain +2 Taint (unavoidable)
- Every turn: 1d6 random hexes become Void Rifts
- Every turn: Spawn 2 Abominations
- At Turn 10: Choice—*"Complete the ritual? Y/N"*

**Victory**: Survive 10 turns, activate Sigma Prototype

**Campaign Ending**:
- **The Engine ruptures reality permanently.** Void and material world merge.
- **You gain infinite power.** Soulstones rain from sky. Your Caskets evolve into godlike war machines.
- **Everything becomes corrupted.** Civilians mutate. Settlements twist. Reality becomes nightmare.
- **You become monsters.** Your pilots lose humanity, transform into Abomination-hybrid demigods.
- **Epilogue**: The world becomes Hell. You rule it as demon kings. The Void whispers: *"Welcome home."*

**Tone**: Pyrrhic victory → Total damnation. You won power, but destroyed everything you fought for.

---

### Ending 4: "Stabilize the Engine" (Engineering)
**Requirements**: Allied with Dwarves, have Theslar's Research (from Mission 5 Option C)

**Mission**: Install failsafe runecraft to prevent Engine from ever exploding again

**Objective**: Protect Dwarven engineers for 8 turns while they work

**Enemies**: 4× Automated Defenses (Scrap Golems), 2× Church Saboteurs (if Church hostile)

**Victory**: Engineers successfully install Dwarven Runecrafted Failsafe System

**Campaign Ending**:
- **The Engine stabilizes permanently.** No more explosions, no more instability.
- **Magic remains, but controlled.** Soulstones still exist but stop corrupting.
- **Dwarves hailed as saviors.** Forge-Guilds become dominant power.
- **Your settlement prospers** as Dwarven trade hub. Technology advances. New golden age begins.
- **Epilogue**: 200 years later, the world has rebuilt. Cities thrive. The Engine is a museum. Children learn: *"This is what we survived."* But deep in the Core, Theslar still screams, unable to die.

**Tone**: Hopeful victory. You saved magic, saved the world, but at the cost of leaving Theslar trapped forever.

---

### Ending 5: "Walk Away" (Survival)
**Requirements**: Refuse all choices, abandon the Engine

**Mission**: Escape the Engine facility before it explodes (countdown: 6 turns)

**Objective**: Reach exit before turn 6 (simple escape mission)

**Enemies**: 3× Engine Wraiths (pursuit), environmental hazards

**Victory**: Escape alive

**Campaign Ending**:
- **You leave The Engine to its fate.** Someone else's problem.
- **The Engine continues pulsing.** Nothing changes. World remains broken.
- **Your settlement survives, but stagnates.** No progress, no decline, just... existence.
- **You retire as scavengers.** No heroes, no legends. Just survivors.
- **Epilogue**: 50 years later, nothing has changed. The Engine still stands. Abominations still spawn. Wars still rage. You're alive, but... was it worth it?

**Tone**: Hollow non-ending. You survived, but solved nothing. The cycle continues.
