## Event System Overview

### Kingdom Death Inspiration

Like Kingdom Death: Monster, Penance uses **departure** and **arrival** event tables rolled with **2d6 dice**.

**Double rolls** (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66) trigger **catastrophic or legendary events**.

### When to Roll

**DEPARTURE EVENTS** (Before Mission):
- Roll 2d6 before leaving settlement
- Read result as two separate digits (roll of 3 and 4 = "34" not "7")
- Resolve event before deploying to mission

**ARRIVAL EVENTS** (After Mission):
- Roll 2d6 after returning from mission
- Only roll if mission was completed (survivors returned)
- Resolve event during Settlement Phase

---

## DEPARTURE EVENT TABLE (2d6)

Roll 2d6. Read the dice individually (3+4 = 34, not 7). Doubles are catastrophic.

### 11 - THE OFFERING

**Type**: Sacrifice

One pilot must make a **Blood Offering** before deployment:
- **Option A**: Discard top 5 cards from HP deck before mission starts (start at 25 HP)
- **Option B**: Roll on Minor Injury table, suffer 1 Wound immediately
- **Effect**: If sacrifice is made, all pilots gain +1 SP maximum this mission

**Narrative**: The Church demands penance. The settlement shrine glows with Soulstone light, hungry for sacrifice.

---

### 12 - OMEN OF RUIN

**Type**: Curse

All pilots suffer **Bad Luck** this mission:
- Reroll any natural 6 rolled on attacks (keep second result, even if worse)
- Terrain hazards deal +1 damage
- Heat generation +1 per action

**Narrative**: Black crows circle the settlement. The Soulstones pulse erratically. Something is wrong.

---

### 13 - EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION

**Type**: Gear Failure

Roll 1d6 per pilot:
- **1-2**: Primary Weapon jams (costs +1 SP to use all mission)
- **3-4**: Shield/Offhand damaged (reduce all Defense by 1 this mission)
- **5-6**: Plating/Sigil offline (remove 1 random Accessory card from deck this mission)

**Narrative**: Pre-mission checks reveal structural flaws. No time to repair—deploy anyway.

---

### 14 - SUPPLIES SHORTAGE

**Type**: Resource Drain

Settlement loses **2 Scrap** OR **1d6 Credits**:

**Narrative**: One of your own has been whispering to the dark. Their eyes glow faintly. They smile too much. The others don't trust them.
