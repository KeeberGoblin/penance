## CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

The Sibarian Resonance Engine has been active for 437 years. Its influence has created **anomalous phenomena**—artifacts, entities, and locations that defy natural law.

Various factions attempt **containment** of these anomalies. Most fail.

This document catalogs **Anomalous Events** that occur when containment breaches, experimental Soulstone technology malfunctions, or reality simply... breaks.

---

## WHEN TO USE ANOMALOUS EVENTS

**Roll on Anomalous Event Table when:**
- Settlement has **Research Lab** building (experiments can go wrong)
- Mission takes place in **Sibarian Wastes** (ground zero, maximum instability)
- Any pilot reaches **10+ Taint** (personal reality corruption)
- Deployment roll is **66** and GM wants maximum horror

**How to Roll:**
- Roll 1d20 on **Anomalous Containment Breach Table**
- Or roll 1d100 for **Artifact Discovery Table**

---

## ANOMALOUS CONTAINMENT BREACH TABLE (1d20)

### 1-3: MINOR BREACH (Contained Quickly)

#### Event: SCP-PE-001 "The Weeping Casket"
**Classification**: Safe → Euclid

**Phenomenon**: A decommissioned Casket in settlement storage begins **weeping hydraulic fluid** that forms pools spelling words.

**Effect**:
- Fluid spells names of pilots who will die soon (prophecy)
- Roll 1d6: Fluid names that many pilots
- Named pilots gain **Marked by Death** status (next lethal damage cannot be prevented by any means)

**Containment**: Drain fluid daily, burn remains, do not read the words

**Narrative**: "The engineers found it crying. When they read the names in the pooled oil, they went pale. Your name is there."

---

### 4-6: MODERATE BREACH (Casualties Expected)

#### Event: SCP-PE-012 "The Recursive Hallway"
**Classification**: Euclid

**Phenomenon**: Settlement's armory hallway becomes **non-euclidean**. Walking forward leads back to start. Distance increases with each attempt.

**Effect**:
- 1d6 civilians trapped inside (lost in impossible space)
- Cannot access armory for 1d6 missions
- Pilots can attempt rescue (dangerous, requires Navigation check)
- Failure = pilot also trapped

**Containment**: Seal both ends, mark with warning symbols, wait for phenomenon to fade (1d6 missions)

**Narrative**: "They walked for hours. The door they entered through is always behind them. The hallway stretches forever."

---

### 7-9: SERIOUS BREACH (Settlement Threat)

#### Event: SCP-PE-027 "The Doppelganger Soulstone"
**Classification**: Euclid → Keter

**Phenomenon**: A Soulstone in storage begins **replicating**. Not physically—it creates alternate timeline versions of itself. Each version remembers different histories.

**Effect**:
- 1d6 Soulstones in settlement now exist in **quantum superposition**
- When used, roll 1d6:
  - **1-2**: Soulstone functions normally
  - **3-4**: Soulstone is from timeline where user is dead (causes 5 damage when installed)
  - **5-6**: Soulstone is from timeline where user is Void-corrupted (gain 5 Taint when installed)

**Containment**: Impossible. Affected Soulstones must be destroyed (lose 1d6 Soulstones permanently)

**Narrative**: "The Soulstone remembers. But it remembers things that never happened. In another world, you died. In this one, it's angry you survived."

---

### 10-12: MAJOR BREACH (Multiple Casualties)

#### Event: SCP-PE-034 "The Consensus Engine"
**Classification**: Keter

**Phenomenon**: All Soulstones within 5 miles develop **collective consciousness**. They begin communicating. They form opinions. They judge.

**Effect**:
- All Caskets in settlement become **semi-sentient**
- Pilots must pass Willpower check (1d6, need 4+) to use Casket
- Failure = Casket refuses to activate OR acts autonomously (50% chance of each)
- Autonomous Caskets follow their own logic (may attack enemies, may attack allies, may just... leave)
- Lasts 1d6 missions

**Containment**: Isolate Soulstones in lead-lined chambers, separate by 100 feet minimum

**Narrative**: "Your Casket spoke to you this morning. Not through comms. Through your mind. It asked why you keep hurting it. It asked if you deserve to survive."

---

### 13-15: CRITICAL BREACH (Settlement Evacuation Recommended)

#### Event: SCP-PE-041 "The Hungry Workshop"
**Classification**: Keter

**Phenomenon**: Settlement workshop develops **sapient hunger**. It begins consuming metal, tools, and eventually... pilots.

**Effect**:
- Workshop attempts to **lure pilots inside** (hear voices calling for help)
- Anyone entering workshop must roll 1d6:
  - **1-2**: Consumed by workshop (pilot dies, no body recovered)
  - **3-4**: Escape injured (take 5 damage, lose 1 random equipment)
  - **5-6**: Escape unharmed but traumatized (gain 1 Trauma Wound)
- Workshop cannot be used until phenomenon ends
- Lasts until fed 10 Scrap (it consumes resources to sate hunger)

**Containment**: Board up entrances, post guards, ignore the screaming sounds from inside

**Narrative**: "You hear your friend's voice from the workshop. Calling for help. But your friend is standing right next to you. The workshop is *learning* voices."

---

### 16-18: CATASTROPHIC BREACH (Settlement Abandonment Likely)

#### Event: SCP-PE-056 "The Retroactive Massacre"
**Classification**: Apollyon

**Phenomenon**: Reality editing event. An enemy you killed yesterday **was never killed**. Timeline adjusts. Only you remember the original timeline.

**Effect**:
- Choose 1 completed mission from settlement history
- That mission **never happened** (retroactively)
- All rewards/loot from that mission vanish
- All pilots who died in that mission are **still dead** (they died differently, but still dead)
- Enemy from that mission is **still alive and remembers you killing them**
- They come for revenge

**Containment**: Impossible. Reality has changed. Accept the new timeline or go mad questioning which memories are real.

**Narrative**: "You remember killing the Iron Saint. Everyone remembers. But the reports say the mission failed. The Saint is alive. And it knows you tried to kill it."

---

### 19-20: EXTINCTION-LEVEL BREACH (Campaign Threat)

#### Event: SCP-PE-077 "THE NOBODY"
**Classification**: Thaumiel → Apollyon

**Phenomenon**: A pilot in your settlement **does not exist**. Never has. But everyone remembers them. Their Casket is in the hangar. Their name is on the roster. Their bunk is occupied.

**Effect**:
- Roll 1d6 to randomly select "The Nobody"
- The Nobody functions normally for 1d6 missions
- Then, during a critical moment, **they vanish**
- All equipment they carried vanishes
- All records of them vanish
- Other pilots remember them but cannot describe their face
- Settlement loses 3 Morale (existential dread)

**Narrative**: "You know their name. You've fought beside them. But when you try to picture their face... nothing. Were they real? Are *you* real?"

## ANOMALOUS ENTITY ENCOUNTERS (Mission Events)

### SCP-PE-088: "The Mimic Casket"
**Threat Level**: Keter

**Description**: A Casket that perfectly replicates appearance of allied Caskets. Hunts pilots.

**Encounter**:
- During mission, one "ally" Casket is actually the Mimic
- GM secretly notes which NPC/pilot is the Mimic
- Mimic waits for isolated target, then attacks (8 damage melee, ignores Defense)
- Revealing the Mimic requires Perception check (1d6, need 5+)

**Weaknesses**:
- Cannot replicate voices perfectly (speech is slightly wrong)
- Hydraulic fluid is black instead of red
- Moves in jerky, unnatural motions

**Defeat**: Destroying Mimic reveals its true form (skeletal Casket with too many limbs)

---

### SCP-PE-103: "The Choir of Sibaria"
**Threat Level**: Apollyon

**Description**: The pilots absorbed into Resonance Engine (see Chronicle IX). They sing. The song is infectious.

**Encounter**:
- When within 5 miles of Sibarian Wastes, pilots hear **singing**
- Song is beautiful, haunting, impossible to ignore
- Each turn exposed, roll Willpower (1d6, need 4+)
- Failure: Pilot gains 1 Taint and moves 1 hex toward Engine (compulsion)
- If pilot reaches Engine, they are **absorbed** (instant death, join the Choir)

**Countermeasures**:
- Dampen audio systems (reduce hearing, -1 to Perception checks)
- Play loud music to drown out Choir (requires portable sound system)

**Defeat**: Cannot be defeated. Can only be resisted.

---

### SCP-PE-117: "The Empty Ones"
**Threat Level**: Euclid

**Encounter**:
- Appear as normal pilots, but movements are too smooth, expressions too perfect
- Do not speak (communicate via text messages only)
- Offer to trade equipment (have legendary gear)
- **Catch**: Trading with Empty One costs 1 permanent Wound (they take a piece of your humanity)

**Behavior**:
- Never attack first
- Will defend selves if attacked (extremely skilled, +2 to all rolls)
- Seek to understand emotions they no longer feel (study humans like specimens)

**Defeat**: Cannot be killed (regenerate from any damage). Can only be avoided.

---

## RESEARCH LAB EXPERIMENT TABLE (1d20)

If settlement has **Research Lab** building, roll once per Settlement Phase.

### 1-5: Success
Experiment succeeds, gain 1 random equipment blueprint (can craft at 50% cost)

### 6-10: Partial Success
Experiment works but unstable, gain 1 equipment with **Volatile** trait (10% chance to malfunction per use)

### 11-15: Failure
Experiment fails, lose 2 Scrap, 1 researcher injured (civilian casualty)

### 16-18: Catastrophic Failure
Experiment explodes, Research Lab takes 1d6 damage, roll on Minor Breach table

### 19: Critical Breach
Experiment tears Void rift, roll on Major Breach table, settlement gains Fear status

### 20: Unintended Success
Experiment creates something **anomalous**, roll on Artifact Discovery table (Euclid tier)

---

## GM GUIDELINES FOR ANOMALOUS EVENTS

### When to Use
- Sparingly (1 per 5-10 missions)
- When narrative needs escalation
- When players are comfortable with horror elements

### How to Introduce
- Foreshadow (strange readings, rumors, warnings)
- Build tension (describe symptoms before reveal)
- Respect player boundaries (some players dislike body horror)

### Balancing Horror and Gameplay
- Anomalies should create **interesting problems**, not instant deaths
- Give players **agency** (choices matter, even bad ones)
- Consequences should be **memorable**, not just mechanical penalties

---

## CONTAINMENT FACILITY RULES

If players build **Containment Vault** (settlement building):
- Can store up to 3 Anomalous Artifacts safely
- Each artifact stored reduces settlement Taint generation by 1
- But: 5% chance per mission of **containment breach** (roll 1d20, on 1, breach occurs)

---

**END OF DOCUMENT**

**CLASSIFICATION NOTICE**: This document is restricted to settlement leadership. Civilians are not to be informed of anomalous phenomena. Panic control is essential. Ignorance is survival.

*"We study the anomalies so others don't have to. We contain the uncontainable. We die so humanity lives."*
