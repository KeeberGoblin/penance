# Settlement Mechanics
## Campaign Base-Building System

**Version**: 0.1
**Last Updated**: October 10, 2025

## Design Philosophy

Drawing from Kingdom Death's settlement phase, this system focuses on:
- **Meaningful scarcity** - resources are always limited, forcing hard choices
- **Interconnected upgrades** - buildings unlock other buildings, creating strategic paths
- **Narrative consequences** - settlements tell stories through their architecture
- **Asymmetric disasters** - settlements can be destroyed, and recovery is brutal
- **No pure optimization** - every choice has a cost

---

## Core Mechanics

### Settlement Phases

**Campaign Structure**: Missions ‚Üí Settlement Phase ‚Üí Missions ‚Üí Settlement Phase

After every **2-3 missions**, players return to their settlement for:
1. **Triage** - Repair damaged Caskets, treat wounded pilots
2. **Workshop** - Spend Credits on upgrades and equipment
3. **Construction** - Build or upgrade settlement buildings
4. **Events** - Roll on the Settlement Event table (both good and bad)
5. **Preparation** - Choose next mission, assign pilots

## The Settlement Sheet

### Core Resources

**Credits** (Primary Currency)
- Earned from missions (100 for primary objective, 50 for secondary)
- Spent on repairs, equipment, and construction
- **Scarcity Rule**: Credits don't accumulate infinitely - max bank is 500 (represents logistical limits)

**Scrap** (Salvage Material)
- Gained from destroyed enemy Caskets (1d3 Scrap per kill)
- Used for building construction and emergency repairs
- Can be traded to Forge-Guilds at 2 Scrap = 50 Credits (poor exchange rate)

**Population** (Settlement Size)
- Starts at 10 (small outpost)
- Increases by +1 per successful mission (survivors flock to safety)
- Decreases when settlement is attacked or suffers catastrophic events
- **Maximum Population**: 50 (depends on housing capacity)
- **Population Benefits**: Higher population = more building slots unlocked

**Morale** (Settlement Spirit)
- Starts at 5 (Neutral)
- Scale: 0 (Despair) ‚Üí 10 (Hope)
- Affects event table results (low morale = worse events)
- **Morale Modifiers**:
 - Mission success: +1 Morale
 - Mission failure: -2 Morale
 - Pilot death: -1 Morale
 - Abomination raid survived: +2 Morale
 - Certain buildings provide passive +1 Morale

- Focus: Push toward Tier 3 buildings or faction alignment
- Population: 27 ‚Üí 40

**Phase 4 (Endgame): Powerhouse or Ruin**
- Build: Reliquary, Foundry, or faction-specific building
- Outcome: Either dominate the campaign or suffer spectacular collapse

## Design Notes

### Why This System Works
1. **Scarcity Creates Tension** - You can't build everything, forcing priorities
2. **Buildings Tell Stories** - A settlement with a Reliquary and Ossuarium feels different from one with a Sanctuary and Archive
3. **Disasters Hurt** - Kingdom Death's lesson: loss must be meaningful
4. **Asymmetric Paths** - Church settlements play differently from Scrap-Clan ones

### Balancing Act
- **Income Rate**: ~150-200 Credits per 2 missions (after repairs)
- **Building Costs**: Tier 1 (~100), Tier 2 (~200), Tier 3 (~400)
- **Timeline**: ~15 missions to build a fully upgraded settlement (if you're efficient and lucky)

*"Your settlement is a promise. Will you keep it, or watch it burn?"*
