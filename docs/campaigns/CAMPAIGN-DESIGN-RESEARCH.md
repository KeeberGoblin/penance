# Campaign Design Research
## Grimdark Campaign Structure Analysis

**Purpose**: Design multi-mission campaign chains for Penance that match the game's themes and pacing.

**Sources Analyzed**: Kingdom Death: Monster, Warhammer 40K Crusade, Trench Crusade, SCP Foundation, Dark Souls, Darkest Dungeon

---

## Key Grimdark Campaign Principles

### 1. **Inevitability vs Agency** (Kingdom Death: Monster)
- Players have meaningful choices, but victory is never guaranteed
- Death spiral mechanics: losses accumulate, recovery is partial
- **Penance application**: Permanent scars, component destruction, settlement decline
- **Example**: "You can save the settlement OR hunt the boss, not both"

### 2. **Moral Compromise** (Trench Crusade, 40K)
- No "good" choices, only "less terrible" ones
- Victory requires sacrifices that erode your humanity
- **Penance application**: Use forbidden Tainted equipment? Sacrifice civilians? Betray allies?
- **Example**: "Use this corrupted Soulstone for +5 damage, gain 3 permanent Taint"

### 3. **Branching Consequences** (SCP Foundation, Dark Souls)
- Player choices create diverging paths
- Some branches lock out other content (creates replayability)
- Failed missions still advance the campaign (failure is interesting)
- **Penance application**: Different faction endings, rival pilot relationships, Engine outcomes
- **Example**: "You failed to stop the ritual. Now the Blighted have a new leader."

### 4. **Escalating Dread** (Darkest Dungeon)
- Early missions establish tone and stakes
- Middle missions introduce complications and twists
- Final missions feel apocalyptic, desperate
- **Penance application**: Start with bandit raids, escalate to faction wars, culminate at The Engine
- **Example**: Mission 1 "Clear the ruins" → Mission 5 "The ruins were a trap" → Mission 10 "The Engine awakens"

### 5. **Interlocking Systems** (All sources)
- Campaign affects settlement, settlement affects pilots, pilots affect missions
- Nothing is isolated; every choice ripples outward
- **Penance application**: Settlement events trigger based on mission outcomes
- **Example**: "You saved the refugees (Mission 3). Now they build a Sanctuary (Settlement Phase). Now you can heal Taint (Mission 5 advantage)."

## Campaign Structure Framework

### **Recommended Arc Length**: 8-12 missions
- **Too short (<6)**: No time for consequences to matter
- **Too long (>15)**: Campaign fatigue, power creep issues
- **Sweet spot**: 10 missions (2-3 months of weekly play)

### **Three-Act Structure** (Proven in Warhammer Crusade)

#### **Act 1: Establishment (Missions 1-3)**
**Goal**: Introduce setting, stakes, and player capabilities
- Mission 1: "Your First Raid" (tutorial, low stakes)
- Mission 2: "Complications Arise" (introduce rival or threat)
- Mission 3: "The Hook" (reveal larger conspiracy/danger)

**Pacing**: Quick, victories feel earned, establishes tone
**Tone**: Grim but manageable, "We can handle this"

#### **Act 2: Escalation (Missions 4-7)**
**Goal**: Complicate everything, force hard choices
- Mission 4: "Everything Changes" (major twist or betrayal)
- Mission 5: "Desperate Measures" (moral compromise required)
- Mission 6: "Pyrrhic Victory" (win but at terrible cost)
- Mission 7: "Point of No Return" (commit to finale path)

**Pacing**: Brutal, losses mount, players question if they can win
**Tone**: "We're in over our heads. But we can't stop now."

#### **Act 3: Resolution (Missions 8-10)**
**Goal**: Deliver payoff, force final choice
- Mission 8: "The Gauntlet" (test everything learned)
- Mission 9: "The Betrayal/Revelation" (major story twist)
- Mission 10: "The Ending" (branching finale based on choices)

**Pacing**: Relentless, apocalyptic, all-or-nothing
**Tone**: "We've come too far to turn back. This ends now."

## Branching Choice Design (SCP/Dark Souls Style)

### **The Key: Meaningful Exclusivity**
- Choice A locks out Choice B permanently
- No "rewind" or "try again"
- Creates actual tension and replayability

### **Example Branch Structure**:
```
Mission 5: "The Prisoner"
├─ Kill the prisoner → Gain intel, rival faction +hatred, unlock "Assassination" missions
├─ Free the prisoner → Gain ally, rival faction neutral, unlock "Redemption" missions
└─ Interrogate + release → Gain partial intel, prisoner becomes rival boss later
```

### **Penance-Specific Branch Points**:
1. **Soulstone Source** (Mission 3):
   - Scavenge from ruins (safe, low yield) → Slow progression
   - Raid enemy convoy (dangerous, high yield) → Faction war escalates
   - Deal with Fae (instant power, future debt) → Fae subplot activates

2. **Settlement Crisis** (Mission 5):
   - Defend settlement (safe, miss loot mission) → Keep morale high
   - Abandon settlement temporarily (risky, get loot) → Morale crash, population loss
   - Split party (both missions, both harder) → Potential pilot death

3. **Engine Revelation** (Mission 7):
   - Believe Church doctrine (destroy Engine path) → Church alliance
   - Believe Dwarven theory (stabilize Engine path) → Dwarven alliance
   - Believe Fae whispers (exploit Engine path) → Fae corruption

4. **Final Choice** (Mission 10):
   - Destroy Engine → World stabilizes, magic fades, Caskets become obsolete (bittersweet)
   - Control Engine → You become new tyrant, power corrupts (dark victory)
   - Leave Engine → Kick the can down the road, next generation's problem (survival)

## Penance Campaign Themes (Must Include)

### **1. Redemption is Ambiguous**
- You can atone for sins, but never fully cleanse yourself
- Every victory requires moral compromise
- **Campaign Arc**: "Are we heroes or just survivors?"

### **2. The Past Haunts the Present**
- Old World ruins, lost technology, forgotten sins
- Characters encounter consequences of Theslar's hubris
- **Campaign Arc**: "We're cleaning up someone else's apocalypse"

### **3. Factions as People, Not Monoliths**
- Church has doubters, Dwarves have idealists, Undead have emotions
- Rival pilots are sympathetic, not just obstacles
- **Campaign Arc**: "The enemy pilot you kill had a family"

### **4. Power Comes at a Cost**
- Stronger equipment = more Taint
- Better pilots = more trauma
- Winning battles = losing pieces of yourself
- **Campaign Arc**: "We won the war, but lost ourselves"

### **5. Hope Exists, But It's Fragile**
- Settlements can thrive, pilots can heal, peace is possible
- But it requires constant effort and sacrifice
- **Campaign Arc**: "We keep fighting because what else is there?"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ **"Railroad Plot"**
- Campaign forces specific outcomes regardless of player choice
- **Fix**: Every mission should have at least 2 valid outcomes (success/failure both advance story)

### ❌ **"Grim for Grim's Sake"**
- Misery without purpose, nihilism without meaning
- **Fix**: Grimdark works best when hope flickers, not when it's extinguished

### ❌ **"Power Creep"**
- Players become too strong, trivialize later missions
- **Fix**: Permanent injuries, settlement attrition, enemy escalation

### ❌ **"Lore Dumps"**
- Walls of text, no player agency during exposition
- **Fix**: Reveal lore through gameplay (found documents, environmental storytelling)

### ❌ **"Fake Choices"**
- "Choose A or B" but both lead to same outcome
- **Fix**: Real branches with exclusive content

## Ideal Penance Campaign Chain Structure

### **Campaign: "The Scar Campaign"**
**Hook**: Your settlement sits on ruins of pre-Cataclysm research station. Strange signals detected.
**Length**: 10 missions (8-12 weeks)
**Tone**: Mystery → Horror → Desperate Hope

### Mission Flow:
1. **"Strangers at the Gates"** - Defend settlement from bandits, capture one alive
2. **"The Prisoner's Tale"** - Learn of rival faction hunting the same ruins
3. **"Race to the Depths"** - First expedition into ruins, discover Soulstone cache
4. **"What Was Found"** - Soulstones are corrupted, settlement affected, rival arrives
5. **"The Compromise"** - Choice: Use corrupted stones (power), trade them (allies), or destroy (safe)
6. **"Consequences Cascade"** - Rival makes opposite choice, escalates conflict
7. **"The Revelation"** - Ruins contained Theslar's backup research, Engine can be affected
8. **"Factions Converge"** - Church, Dwarves, Fae all want the research (3-way battle)
9. **"The Wound Opens"** - Using research destabilizes reality, Abominations pour out
10. **"The Choice"** - Destroy research (safe), use it on Engine (risky), or keep it (power)

### Branching Outcomes:
- **Destroyed**: World safer, rivals respect you, settlement prospers (peaceful ending)
- **Used on Engine**: Engine briefly stabilizes, then explodes (apocalyptic ending, setup for next campaign)
- **Kept**: You become threat, all factions turn on you, settlement destroyed (dark ending)

### Settlement Integration:
- Mission 1 success → Build Watchtower (early warning system for later missions)
- Mission 3 loot → Build Workshop (craft better equipment for Mission 6+)
- Mission 5 choice → Build Sanctuary OR Armory (healing vs offense)
- Mission 7 failure → Settlement attacked while you're away (population loss)
- Mission 10 outcome → Settlement fate determined

## Campaign Pacing Guide

### **Mission Duration**: 60-90 minutes each
- Too short: No tension buildup
- Too long: Fatigue, player burnout

### **Between-Mission Activities** (15-30 minutes):
- Settlement Phase (6 steps)
- Pilot healing/scarring
- Equipment crafting/trading
- Downtime events

### **Total Campaign Time**: 15-20 hours (2-3 months weekly)

### **Rest Points** (Player Breathers):
- After Mission 3 (Act 1 complete)
- After Mission 7 (before finale)
- Never during Act 3 (maintain tension)

---

## Next Steps: Implementation

1. **Choose Campaign Arc** (1-2 from world-overview.md hooks OR create new one)
2. **Design Mission Sequence** (10 missions, 3 acts, branching paths)
3. **Create Mission Documents** (objectives, maps, enemy loadouts, consequences)
4. **Write Settlement Events** (triggered by mission outcomes)
5. **Playtest Mission 1-3** (validate pacing before completing rest)

---

## Recommended First Campaign

**"The Scavenger's Crusade"** (from world-overview.md)
- Already hooks into existing lore (Sibarian Wastes, The Engine)
- Natural escalation (start small, end apocalyptic)
- Multiple factions involved (Church, Dwarves, Fae, Abominations)
- Clear moral dilemmas (use forbidden power vs stay pure)
- Branching finale (destroy/control/exploit Engine)

This aligns with:
- Kingdom Death's escalating dread
- 40K's moral compromises
- SCP's mystery revelation
- Darkest Dungeon's corruption mechanics
- Penance's existing Taint/Component Destruction systems
