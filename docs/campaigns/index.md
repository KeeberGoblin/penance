# Campaign Systems

Long-form campaign mechanics for persistent play across multiple missions.

## Core Campaign Mechanics

### [Settlement Management](settlements.md)
Build and defend your home base between missions
- Resource generation
- Building construction
- NPC relationships
- Settlement events and threats

### [Pilot Progression](pilot-progression.md)
How your pilot changes over time
- **Pilot Scars**: Permanent injuries from combat
- **Traits**: Earned through experience
- **Taint Levels**: Corruption from Abominations
- **Death & Legacy**: What happens when your pilot dies

### [Flesh Bargain System](flesh-bargain.md)
The dark heart of Penance: sacrifice your body for power
- Permanent HP reduction for deck upgrades
- Each leg = -3 HP, unlock better cards
- Irreversible body horror progression
- "How much are you willing to pay for victory?"

### [Loot Tables](loot-tables.md)
Post-mission rewards and salvage
- Equipment cards
- Soulstones
- Rare components
- Cursed artifacts

## Campaign Flow

```
MISSION → AFTERMATH → SETTLEMENT PHASE → DOWNTIME → NEXT MISSION
```

1. **Mission**: Complete scenario, track damage taken
2. **Aftermath**: Roll for pilot scars, distribute loot
3. **Settlement Phase**: Spend resources, build, recruit
4. **Downtime**: Pilot activities, relationships, events
5. **Next Mission**: Choose next scenario

## Permanent Consequences

- Scars never heal
- Destroyed components stay destroyed
- Dead pilots stay dead (but their equipment doesn't)
- Settlement buildings burn forever
- Leg skimming is irreversible

This is Kingdom Death Monster-style brutality. **Everything has a cost.**
