# Loot Tables
## Rewards & Scavenging System

**Version**: 0.1
**Last Updated**: October 10, 2025

---

## Design Philosophy

Drawing from Kingdom Death's settlement reward system, loot is:
- **Scarce** - you can't get everything, forcing choices
- **Thematic** - loot reflects where/what you killed
- **Random** - dice determine fate, creating memorable moments
- **Impactful** - rare loot can change campaigns

---

## Loot Sources

### 1. Mission Completion (Guaranteed)
- **Primary Objective**: 100 Credits + 1 roll on Common Loot table
- **Secondary Objective**: 50 Credits
- **Hidden Objective**: 75 Credits + 1 roll on Uncommon Loot table

### 2. Enemy Kills (Chance-Based)
- **Minion Enemies** (Swarms, Scouts): 10% chance to drop loot
- **Elite Enemies** (Champions): 50% chance to drop loot
- **Boss Enemies** (Named NPCs, Large Abominations): 100% + Roll twice on Rare table

### 3. Scavenging the Battlefield (Post-Mission)
- Spend 1 hour (in-game time) searching ruins: 1d3 Scrap + 1 roll on Scrap Loot table
- Risk: 1d6 roll - on 1, encounter wandering Abomination or rival scavengers

### 4. Settlement Events (Random)
- Certain events on the Settlement Event table grant loot (see [settlement-mechanics.md](settlement-mechanics.md))

### 5. Siberian Wastes Expeditions
- Theslar Engine missions always yield loot, but at great risk (see [theslar-engine-mechanics.md](theslar-engine-mechanics.md))

## Design Notes

### Scarcity Philosophy
- Loot is **rare enough** to feel special, but **common enough** to provide progression
- Common loot = consumables and minor upgrades (keeps you going)
- Rare/Legendary = game-changers (defining moments)

### Faction Alignment Matters
- Positive faction relationships unlock unique trade goods
- Negative relationships = no trades (you're on your own)
- Creates incentive to maintain political relationships

### Boss Loot as Story Rewards
When players kill an Iconic NPC (e.g., Sister Vex, Thresh), award their **signature item**:
- **Vex**: Her prayer chains (grants Martyrdom Protocol ability)
- **Kess**: The Briar-Thorn Casket (bio-mechanical Scout)
- **Durr**: Probability Matrix implant (grants perfect calculation)
- **Thresh**: The Ebon Ledger (soul contract powers)
- **Mockingbird**: A stolen mask (grants Fae bargaining ability)
