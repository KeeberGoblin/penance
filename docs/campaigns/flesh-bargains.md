# Flesh Bargain: The Veteran's Sacrifice
## Penance: Casket Control System Extension

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: October 10, 2025

---

## Overview

**"To make room for the machine, we remove what we no longer need."**

Veteran pilots undergo **Flesh Bargain** (also called "Shortening," "The Cut," or "Taking the Compact") — surgical amputation of the legs at the upper thigh, just below the hip socket. This allows:
- **Smaller capsule volume** (shorter pilot = less fluid needed)
- **More space for augmentation ports** (direct neural interfaces beyond just fingers)
- **Reduced metabolic needs** (less body mass = less oxygen, slower exhaustion)
- **Symbolic commitment** (permanent proof of dedication)

**This is optional but common.** After 5-10 missions, most pilots choose it willingly. The benefits are significant. The cost is permanent.

---

## The Procedure

### Surgical Details

**Amputation Specifications**:
- **Location**: Upper thigh, just below hip socket (femoral amputation, both legs)
- **Anesthesia**: General (unlike First Sync, pilot is unconscious—mercy, not necessity)
- **Duration**: 6-8 hours for both legs (major surgery, multiple arteries to seal)
- **Recovery**: 4-6 weeks before re-entering capsule (extensive nerve healing)
- **Prosthetics**: None practical for walking—pilots use wheelchairs outside Casket

**What's Removed**:
- Entire legs from upper thigh down (femur, knee, shin, ankle, foot)
- Approximately 30-35% of body mass
- 18-24 inches of height (pilot becomes dramatically shorter)
- 40-50% of body's oxygen demand

**What's Added**:
- **Augmentation Ports** in the hip stumps (secondary neural interfaces, 4-6 ports per stump)
- **Stabilizer mounts** for capsule suspension (hip stumps lock directly into capsule frame)
- **Cooling nodes** embedded in stump tissue (large surface area for heat dissipation)
- **Backup control clusters** (if hand threads fail, hip stumps can take over leg movement)

**Post-Surgery Capsule Modifications**:
- Capsule interior shortened by 18-24 inches (massive freed vertical space)
- Pilot now occupies only upper 3-4 feet of capsule (dramatic reduction)
- Freed space used for:
  - **Enhanced Soulstone housing** (can fit 2-3 stones instead of 1)
  - **Massive oxygen reserves** (effectively doubles deployment duration)
  - **Secondary control nodes** (hip stumps connect directly to leg servos + auxiliary systems)
  - **Emergency fluid reserves** (if capsule breaches, backup fluid auto-fills from lower chamber)
  - **Additional armor plating** (lower capsule becomes pure armor, no body to protect)
  - **Cooling system expansion** (hip stumps have massive surface area for thermal management)

## Gameplay Benefits

### Mechanical Advantages (if pilot undergoes Skimming)

**+1 Soul Point Maximum**
- Light Caskets: 5 → 6 SP
- Medium Caskets: 4 → 5 SP
- Heavy Caskets: 3 → 4 SP
- Assault Caskets: 2 → 3 SP
- *Explanation*: More efficient neural load distribution across augmented stumps

**+2 Heat Capacity**
- Can push 2 additional actions into Danger Zone before Strain Roll
- *Explanation*: Stump cooling nodes dissipate heat more effectively

**+1 Deployment Duration**
- Can stay in capsule 1 hour longer before mandatory disconnect
- *Explanation*: Reduced body mass = reduced oxygen consumption

**New Ability: Stump Override**
- **Once per mission**: Ignore one Thread Snap result (stumps take over control temporarily)
- *Explanation*: Secondary neural ports provide backup motor control
- *Drawback*: -2 to all actions for rest of mission (crude control)

**Improved Thread Recovery**
- After Thread Snap, regain control 1 round faster
- *Explanation*: Backup pathways route around damaged thread

### Mechanical Disadvantages (permanent vulnerabilities)

**Outside Casket Mobility**:
- **Wheelchair-bound** (no prosthetics can replace upper thigh amputation)
- **Cannot walk at all** without being carried
- **Cannot stand** (no legs to support body weight)
- **Automatic failure** on all Athletics/Acrobatics checks requiring legs
- **Must be carried** to/from capsule by attendants (cannot self-evacuate)
- **Cannot flee** from danger (completely dependent on others for movement)

**Social Stigma** (faction-dependent):
- Some factions honor it (Church), others pity it (Elves), some mock it (Fae)
- NPCs react differently—some see sacrifice, others see mutilation
- Children may be frightened by Skimmed pilots

**Total Dependency**:
- **Require assistance** for ALL daily tasks:
  - Dressing (can't reach lower body)
  - Bathing (fall risk, can't stand in shower)
  - Eating (must be brought food, can't carry it)
  - Toileting (need accessible facilities + assistance)
  - Moving between rooms (wheelchair or carried)
- **Settlement infrastructure critical** (no ramps/lifts = trapped in one room)
- **Increased post-mission care time** (+45 minutes hip stump maintenance)
- **Cannot participate in settlement defense** if attacked on foot

**Irreversible**:
- Once Skimmed, **cannot be undone EVER**
- No prosthetics exist that restore function (hip socket gone)
- Outside Casket, you are permanently disabled
- If you later regret it, you live with it for the rest of your life

## Cultural Responses by Faction

### Church of Absolution: **Honored Sacrifice**

**Title**: **"The Shortened"** (reverent)

**Cultural View**:
- Seen as ultimate penance—giving flesh to earn salvation
- Ceremony held after surgery (public, Church bells ring)
- Shortened pilots receive:
  - Better rations (extra meat, fresh water)
  - Softer beds (feather mattresses)
  - Priority healing (priests attend them first)
  - Social respect (even Cardinals bow to Shortened)

**Quote**:
> *"They walked on sinful legs. Now they float in grace. Their sacrifice brings us all closer to Absolution."*

**Pressure**: Church subtly pressures pilots to Skim (not forced, but heavily encouraged after 5 missions)

---

### Elven Verdant Covenant: **Tragic Necessity**

**Title**: **"The Pruned"**

**Cultural View**:
- Viewed with sorrow, not honor
- Elves mourn what was lost (legs = connection to earth)
- Understand why it's done (survival demands sacrifice)
- Stumps are carved with memorial runes (names of forests that burned)

**Quote**:
> *"We cut away the dead wood so the tree may live. But each cut reminds us of what the Sundering took from us."*

**Pressure**: None. Elves never suggest Skimming. If pilot chooses it, they're supported, but it's treated as funeral.

---

### Dwarven Clans: **Practical Upgrade**

**Title**: **"Compact Pilots"** (technical term)

**Cultural View**:
- Seen as engineering optimization (remove inefficiency)
- Dwarves build the BEST prosthetics (hydraulic peg-legs, shock-absorbing stumps)
- Skimmed pilots get:
  - Priority forge access (build your own prosthetics)
  - Engineering respect (you optimized yourself)
  - Better contract pay (+10% salary, you're more efficient)

**Quote**:
> *"Less meat, more metal. That's progress. Why carry weight that doesn't help you fight?"*

**Pressure**: Moderate. Dwarven pilots are offered the option at Mission 5 with detailed cost/benefit analysis.

---

### The Ossuarium: **Already Dead Anyway**

**Title**: **"Efficient Forms"**

**Cultural View**:
- Obvious choice (you don't need legs if you're already dead)
- Some Ossuarium pilots remove MORE (arms, torso, until only skull remains)
- No ceremony, no drama—it's filed as "Maintenance"
- Skimmed Ossuarium pilots often remove stumps entirely (just floating torso)

**Quote**:
> *"Flesh is waste. Remove it. A skull piloting a Casket is perfection."*

**Pressure**: Constant. The Ossuarium expects all pilots to Skim by Mission 3. Not doing so is seen as "clinging to life."

---

### The Wyrd Conclave: **Amusing Commitment**

**Title**: **"Grounded Ones"** (mocking, but affectionate)

**Cultural View**:
- Fae find it both horrifying and fascinating (mortals mutilate themselves for *power*?)
- Fae pilots rarely Skim (prefer to keep bodies intact for aesthetic/social reasons)
- But they respect the *audacity* of it
- Skimmed non-Fae pilots are treated as curiosities (exotic, interesting)

**Quote**:
> *"They cut off their legs to walk better. How delightfully broken. How wonderfully desperate."*

**Pressure**: None. Fae never suggest it. If you choose it, they'll throw you a party (because it's absurd theater).

---

### Nomad Collective: **Survival Calculus**

**Title**: **"Short-Haulers"**

**Cultural View**:
- Viewed pragmatically—does benefit outweigh cost?
- Nomad pilots Skim less often (need mobility in harsh environments—can't outrun storms on peg-legs)
- When they do, it's after careful consideration (written cost/benefit analysis required)
- Collective provides excellent stump care (desert survival medicine is advanced)

**Quote**:
> *"Can't run from sandstorms if you got no legs. But can't run anyway if you're dead. Your call, pilot."*

**Pressure**: None. Purely individual choice. Collective neither encourages nor discourages.

---

### The Exchange: **Premium Service Upgrade**

**Title**: **"Executive Pilots"**

**Cultural View**:
- Seen as sign of serious professional commitment (you invested in yourself)
- Exchange pays premium contracts to Skimmed pilots (+20% salary boost)
- Best prosthetics (gold-trimmed peg-legs, cushioned stumps)
- Best post-op care (private recovery rooms, dedicated nurses)
- Best rehabilitation (physical therapy, psychological counseling)

**Quote**:
> *"You cut off your legs for efficiency? We'll compensate you for that efficiency. Welcome to Executive tier, pilot."*

**Pressure**: High. Exchange WANTS you to Skim (more efficient = more profit). They'll pay for surgery if you agree to 5-year contract.

---

### Vestige Bloodlines: **Evolutionary Adaptation**

**Title**: **"Shedders"**

**Cultural View**:
- Some Bloodline legs mutate into useless forms (tentacles, backwards joints, fused toes)
- Skimming is both medical necessity AND upgrade
- Stumps often regenerate as something new (not legs, but functional—maybe claws, maybe stabilizer spines)
- Seen as embracing mutation rather than fighting it

**Quote**:
> *"We didn't need those legs anyway. The Void will give us better ones. Or it won't. Either way, we adapt."*

**Pressure**: Variable. If legs are mutating badly, Bloodline Elders strongly suggest Skimming. Otherwise, it's personal choice.

---

### Emergent Syndicate: **Metamorphosis Stage**

**Title**: **"Pupae"**

**Cultural View**:
- Skimming is seen as molting—shedding inferior human form
- Skimmed Syndicate pilots often grow chitin plates over stumps (natural armor)
- Hive views it as progress toward perfect form (less human = closer to ascension)
- Some Syndicate pilots never leave capsules after Skimming (permanent fusion)

**Quote**:
> *"Legs are for crawling. We have transcended crawling. Shed the flesh. Join the hive fully."*

**Pressure**: Extreme. Syndicate expects ALL pilots to Skim by Mission 5. Refusing is seen as rejecting evolution.

---

## Timing and Player Choice

### When Do Pilots Choose Skimming?

**Rookie Pilots (0-5 missions)**:
- Almost never voluntarily
- Still adjusting to capsule trauma, not ready for more
- Need to prove they'll survive before committing
- Exception: Undead and Emergent Syndicate factions may Skim immediately (cultural pressure)

**Experienced Pilots (5-15 missions)**:
- Most common window for Skimming
- Pilot has survived long enough to see the value
- Body is already scarred/damaged (why not optimize?)
- Peer pressure from veteran pilots ("Join us")
- Benefits become obvious (watching Skimmed pilots deploy longer/harder)

**Veteran Pilots (15+ missions)**:
- If they haven't Skimmed yet, they probably won't
- Either philosophically opposed OR their build doesn't benefit from it
- Or they're too addicted to capsule to care about optimization (just want to pilot)
- Or they've seen Skimmed pilots die and don't want to risk it

### Campaign Event: The Offer

**After Mission 5** (or when player reaches 5 total missions):

> **Surgeon NPC approaches pilot in settlement:**
>
> "You've survived five drops. That's more than most. You're good at this.
>
> I can make you better.
>
> Flesh Bargain. I've done it 200 times. Three-week recovery, then you're back in the capsule with +1 SP, longer deployments, better heat management.
>
> Cost: 50 Credits, 1 Medical Supply. And your legs, obviously.
>
> Think about it. Other pilots will tell you it's worth it. Some will tell you it ruined them.
>
> Your choice. No pressure. Well, maybe a little pressure. [Faction-specific pressure applies here]
>
> What do you say?"

**Player chooses**:
- **Accept**: Surgery happens (cutscene/narrative moment), gain benefits + vulnerabilities, 3-week downtime
- **Decline**: Keep legs, offer appears again at Mission 10, 15, 20 (can always change mind later)

**Once chosen, cannot be reversed.**

## Downtime: Caring for Skimmed Pilots

### Post-Mission Care Requirements

**Stump Maintenance** (30 minutes after each deployment):
1. **Remove augmentation port covers** (twist-lock seals)
2. **Flush ports with saline solution** (prevent infection)
3. **Inspect for neural feedback burns** (thread overload damage)
4. **Apply anti-inflammatory salve** (reduce swelling)
5. **Replace cooling gel packs** (embedded in stump tissue)
6. **Massage stumps** (prevent nerve calcification)
7. **Re-seal ports** (surgical-grade silicone caps)

**If maintenance skipped**: Roll 1d6
- 1-2: Infection (pilot takes 1d6 damage, cannot deploy next mission)
- 3-4: Port fouling (-1 to all Casket actions next mission)
- 5-6: No immediate consequence (but long-term risk increases)

### Enhanced Recovery Needs

**Daily Life as Skimmed Pilot**:
- **Require assistance getting in/out of capsule** (can't climb ladder with peg-legs)
- **Need wheelchair or crutches** between capsule bay and living quarters
- **Can't carry own food** (eat at communal tables, rely on others)
- **Sleep in specially modified bunks** (stump elevation to prevent swelling)
- **Bathing requires assistance** (fall risk in showers)
- **Cannot flee emergencies** (if settlement attacked, must be evacuated by others)

**Social Dynamics**:
- Skimmed pilots become **dependent on settlement infrastructure**
- Form tight bonds with other Skimmed (shared trauma, mutual assistance)
- Non-Skimmed pilots may resent special treatment ("We don't get feather beds")
- Romantic relationships complicated (body image issues, physical dependency)
- Veterans who refuse Skimming are sometimes ostracized by Skimmed pilots ("Why won't you join us?")

### Campaign Mechanic: Pilot Morale

**Morale Modifiers for Skimmed Pilots**:

| Settlement Infrastructure | Morale Modifier |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Barracks only (Tier 1) | -2 (no accessibility, constant pain) |
| Infirmary (Tier 2) | +1 (medical care, accessible bunks) |
| Augmentation Clinic (Tier 3) | +2 (expert care, rehabilitation) |
| Pilot Sanctuary (Tier 4) | +3 (luxury, dedicated attendants) |

| Event | Morale Modifier |
|-------|-----------------|
| Stump maintenance skipped | -3 (pain, risk of infection) |
| Another pilot chooses Skimming | +1 (peer validation) |
| Skimmed pilot dies in mission | -2 (doubt, fear) |
| Non-Skimmed pilot mocks them | -1 (humiliation) |
| Romantic partner accepts them | +2 (acceptance, love) |

**Morale Effects on Gameplay**:
- **High Morale (6+)**: +1 to all Casket actions (motivated, focused)
- **Neutral Morale (3-5)**: No effect
- **Low Morale (0-2)**: -1 to all Casket actions (distracted, depressed)
- **Broken Morale (-1 or lower)**: Refuses to deploy (must spend downtime recovering)

## Extreme Cases: Full Reduction

### "The Torso" (unofficial term for pilots who remove EVERYTHING)

Some pilots go beyond Skimming. They remove:
- **Arms** (don't need them in death pose anyway—threads connect directly to shoulder stumps)
- **Legs** (already gone from Skimming)
- Only **head, neck, spine, and torso** remain
- Threads connect directly to **spinal column** (no hands needed)

**Appearance**:
- Floating limbless torso in capsule
- Threads emerge from vertebrae like cables
- Head often partially shaved (cranial ports added)
- Breathing tube is permanent (can't survive outside capsule without life support)

**Benefits**:
- **+3 SP Maximum** (instead of +1 from Skimming)
- **+4 Heat Capacity** (instead of +2)
- **+3 Deployment Duration** (can stay in capsule for days)
- **Immune to all limb-based Scars** (no arms/legs to damage)
- **Cannot be pulled from capsule** (fully integrated—disconnection = death)

**Costs**:
- **Total dependency** outside Casket (must be carried, fed, bathed by dedicated attendant)
- **Cannot leave capsule for more than 1 hour** (life support dependency)
- **Extreme psychological trauma** (body dysmorphia, suicidal ideation, dissociation)
- **Social isolation** (even other Skimmed pilots find it disturbing)
- **Irreversible and Fatal** (once done, pilot lives in capsule until death)
- **Morale permanently locked at 0** (broken, but functional)

**Frequency**: Extremely rare (maybe 1 in 500 pilots reach this point)

**Why Anyone Would Do This**:
- Desperation (only way to pilot after catastrophic injury)
- Addiction (can't bear to leave capsule anymore)
- Fanaticism (ultimate sacrifice for faction)
- Pragmatism (war needs pilots, and this makes you the best pilot)

**Cultural Responses**:

| Faction | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Church** | *"They have transcended flesh entirely. Saints among us."* (revere them as living martyrs) |
| **Elves** | *"This is what the Sundering has reduced us to. A horror."* (mourn them as lost souls) |
| **Dwarves** | *"Took optimization too far. That's not engineering, that's madness."* (won't perform the surgery) |
| **Undead** | *"Efficient. We approve."* (fully support it, encourage it) |
| **Fae** | *"Magnificent tragedy. We'll watch them until they break completely."* (fascinated) |
| **Nomads** | *"That's not surviving. That's just existing."* (pity them) |
| **Exchange** | *"Not profitable. Can't transfer to new Casket if current one destroyed."* (discourage it) |
| **Bloodlines** | *"They shed everything. Are they still human? Do they care?"* (philosophical) |
| **Syndicate** | *"Perfect. They are one with the machine. The hive welcomes them."* (celebrate it) |

**Gameplay Note**: The Torso is an **endgame state**, not a mid-campaign choice. Only offer it:
- After 20+ missions
- If pilot has maxed-out Capsule Addiction
- If pilot has lost multiple limbs to injuries and surgery is "rebuilding" them

## Narrative Moments

### After First Skimming

> You wake in the Infirmary. The drugs are wearing off. Your legs are gone.
>
> No—not gone. You can still feel them. Your toes wiggle. Your calves itch. But when you look down, there are only bandaged stumps.
>
> The surgeon stands over you, wiping blood off her instruments. "Clean cut. Augmentation ports installed. You'll deploy 20% more efficiently now."
>
> She says it like it's nothing. Like legs are just parts you swap out.
>
> You try to sit up. Pain shoots through your stumps—phantom pain from nerves that no longer connect to anything. You gasp.
>
> "Normal," the surgeon says. "It'll hurt for a month. Then it'll hurt less. Then it'll just be numb."
>
> She gestures to the ward. Three other pilots lie in beds, all Shortened. They watch you with hollow eyes. One nods slowly.
>
> You're one of them now.
>
> Someone brings you crutches. They're worn smooth by other hands. How many pilots used these before you? How many died still wearing them?
>
> How many *forgot they ever had legs at all*?

---

### Veteran Pilot Advice (NPC Dialogue)

> **Conversation with Veteran Skimmed Pilot**:
>
> "Kid, I'm gonna be straight with you. The Skimming hurts. Not the surgery—they knock you out for that—the *after* hurts.
>
> You'll wake up and try to stand, and you'll fall. Every time. For weeks. You'll reach for legs that aren't there. You'll hate yourself.
>
> You'll need help getting dressed. Help getting to the bathroom. Help getting into your rack at night. You'll feel useless.
>
> But then you get back in the capsule.
>
> And suddenly you're *better*. Faster. Stronger. You'll pilot for an extra hour before the exhaustion hits. You'll push into the Danger Zone and your Casket won't scream. You'll dance that 12-ton war machine like it's part of you.
>
> You'll float in that fluid, stumps where your legs were, threads pulling at nothing, and you'll think:
>
> *This is what I was always meant to be.*
>
> And that's when you'll know you made the right choice.
>
> Or the worst mistake of your life.
>
> Honestly? Both.
>
> The Skimming doesn't just take your legs, kid. It takes the *idea* that you were ever whole. You'll never walk again. Period. You'll never stand on your own. You'll never run. You'll never dance, never climb, never feel sand between your toes. You'll roll everywhere in a chair, or someone will carry you like cargo.
>
> But you'll pilot better than you ever dreamed.
>
> So ask yourself: What matters more? The body you had, or the machine you'll become?"

**END OF DOCUMENT**

*"I gave my legs to the machine. The machine gave me power. Now I float in darkness, pulling strings I can barely feel, and I wonder: Did I make a trade? Or did I just lose?"*

— Inscription found in Skimmed pilot's journal, recovered after pilot's death
