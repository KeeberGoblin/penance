# Pilot Generation Tables
## Penance: Campaign System

**Version**: 3.0
**Last Updated**: October 14, 2025

---

## Overview

When your settlement recruits a new pilot (through events, refugee arrivals, or campaign rewards), **roll on these tables** to generate a unique character with backstory, mechanical traits, motivations, and quirks.

**Generation Process**:
1. Roll **Background** (d20) - Who were they before?
2. Roll **Starting Trait** (d20) - Mechanical benefit/penalty (roll twice for hybrid traits)
3. Roll **Motivation** (d20) - Why do they fight?
4. Roll **Quirk** (d100) - Roleplay flavor
5. Roll **Physical Appearance** (d20) - Optional, for narrative depth

**Hybrid Trait System**: If you want more complexity, roll **twice** on the Starting Trait table and combine both effects (e.g., "Steady Hands" + "Survivor" = sniper with PTSD).

## Table 1: Background (d20)

**Who were they before the Casket?**

| d20 | Background | Description | Narrative Hook |
|-----|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Farm Hand** | Rural laborer, simple life. Never saw a Casket until recruitment. | "I just wanted to grow wheat. Now I pilot death." |
| 2 | **Refugee** | Fled from war/disaster. Lost everything. Settlement is their last hope. | "I have nothing left to lose. That makes me dangerous." |
| 3 | **Orphan** | Grew up on streets. Learned to survive alone. Casket = family. | "The machine doesn't judge me. It just fights." |
| 4 | **Blacksmith** | Skilled metalworker. Understands machinery instinctively. | "I forged swords. Now I *am* the sword." |
| 5 | **Healer** | Former medic/apothecary. Knows anatomy (biological and mechanical). | "I saved lives. Now I take them. The Engine changes us all." |
| 6 | **Engineer** | Technical expert. Built things before. Now pilots them. | "I designed Caskets. I never thought I'd be inside one." |
| 7 | **Scout** | Wilderness guide, tracker. Fast reflexes, quiet movement. | "I know how to disappear. The Casket makes that harder." |
| 8 | **Soldier** | Professional fighter. Disciplined. Seen combat before Caskets. | "War never changes. Just the weapons." |
| 9 | **City Guard** | Law enforcement. Protector mentality. Struggles with gray morality. | "I used to arrest criminals. Now I fight monsters." |
| 10 | **Mercenary** | Fought for coin. Loyalty is transactional. Skilled but cynical. | "Credits first. Redemption second. Survival always." |
| 11 | **Priest/Cleric** | Church of Absolution clergy. Faith-driven. Sees Casket as divine tool. | "Through steel, salvation. Through blood, absolution." |
| 12 | **Noble** | Born into privilege. Lost status in The Sundering. Adapting poorly. | "I was taught to rule, not to bleed." |
| 13 | **Scholar** | Librarian, historian, researcher. Knows lore but not combat. | "I studied the Engine. Now I fight because of it." |
| 14 | **Merchant** | Trader, negotiator. Sees everything as transaction. Pragmatic. | "I sold goods. Now I sell my life, one mission at a time." |
| 15 | **Criminal** | Thief, smuggler, or worse. Given choice: Casket or execution. | "I stole to survive. Now I kill to live. Not much difference." |
| 16 | **Exile** | Banished from homeland for crime/heresy. Settlement took them in. | "They cast me out. The Casket welcomed me. Ironic." |
| 17 | **Cultist** | Worshipped the Engine. Believes piloting Caskets is religious duty. | "The Engine sings. I am its voice. Its wrath." |
| 18 | **Nomad** | Wanderer, no homeland. Drifted into settlement. Stays for purpose. | "I've walked a thousand roads. This one leads to something." |
| 19 | **Child of War** | Born after Sundering. Never knew peace. Caskets are normal to them. | "I don't remember the old world. This is all I know." |
| 20 | **Mystery** | No memory of past. Found wandering Tainted wastes. Origin unknown. | "I don't know who I was. The Casket is who I am now." |

## Example Pilot Generation

**Let's create a pilot using the tables:**

### Roll Results:
- **Background (d20)**: 11 = **Priest/Cleric**
- **Starting Trait (d20)**: 14 = **Reckless** (+2 damage first attack, take +1 damage until next turn)
- **Starting Trait (d20 again for hybrid)**: 6 = **Cautious** (+1 Defense, -1 Movement)
- **Motivation (d20)**: 9 = **Faith** (believes piloting is divine will)
- **Quirk (d100)**: 24 = **Prays before/after every mission**
- **Appearance (d20)**: 4 = **Tattooed** (covered in religious symbols)

### Generated Pilot: **Brother Tomas "The Zealot"**

**Background**: Brother Tomas was a priest in the Church of Absolution, tending to the sick and preaching redemption through suffering. When his village was overrun by Tainted beasts, he volunteered to pilot a Casket, believing it was God's will.

**Traits (Hybrid)**:
- **Reckless Aggression**: Brother Tomas opens each engagement with brutal force (+2 damage on first attack each turn, but takes +1 damage until next turn). He believes overwhelming violence is mercy—ending suffering quickly.
- **Cautious Retreat**: After his initial strike, he falls back defensively (+1 Defense, -1 Movement per turn). "Strike hard, then let God protect you."

**Motivation**: Faith drives everything. He sees the Casket as a divine instrument, piloting as sacred duty. Every enemy killed is a mercy, every mission a sermon written in blood.

**Quirk**: Before and after every mission, Brother Tomas kneels and prays for forgiveness—his own, his enemies', and the world's. The prayers grow longer with each kill.

**Appearance**: His arms, neck, and face are covered in Church iconography tattoos—scriptures, martyrs, crosses. He adds a new symbol after each mission, his body a living testament to his service.

**Roleplay Notes**:
- Speaks in religious metaphors ("The Engine is the trial, the Casket is the penance")
- Offers last rites to dying enemies (even if they're still shooting at him)
- Struggles with contradiction: violence vs. mercy, faith vs. doubt
- Other pilots find him intense but respect his conviction

**Mechanical Summary**:
- **Grit**: 0 (new pilot)
- **Morale**: 2 (faithful)
- **Taint**: 0
- **Injuries**: None
- **Starting Trait**: Reckless (+2 dmg first attack, +1 dmg taken) + Cautious (+1 Defense, -1 Movement)
- **Net Effect**: Aggressive opener, defensive follow-up. High-risk playstyle with built-in retreat mechanic.

---

## Using Hybrid Traits

**Hybrid Trait Philosophy**: Rolling twice creates complex, contradictory characters—more realistic and interesting.

**Examples**:

**"Steady Hands" + "Hot-Blooded"**:
- +1 ranged attacks, -1 SP max (precision)
- +1 SP, +1 Heat per turn (aggression)
- **Net**: Normal SP, bonus ranged damage, runs hot. Sniper who gets angry easily.

**"Survivor" + "Lucky"**:
- Grit 1, -1 Morale (hardened veteran)
- Reroll once per mission, -1 Grit (cancel out!)
- **Net**: 0 Grit, -1 Morale, free reroll. Lucky pessimist.

**"Tainted" + "Iron Will"**:
- Start 2 Taint, immune to first Corruption Save
- +2 Willpower Saves, -1 Morale
- **Net**: High Taint but strong will. Fighting corruption internally.

**"Last Stand" + "Death Wish"**:
- At 5 cards: +2 SP, +2 attacks, can't retreat
- Deal double damage, no defensive cards
- **Net**: EXTREME glass cannon. Dies gloriously or wins impossibly.

**GM Guidance**: If hybrid creates contradiction (e.g., "+1 SP" and "-1 SP"), effects cancel. Reroll or let player choose one.

## Integration with Campaign

### When to Use These Tables

**New Pilot Recruitment** (Common):
- Settlement Event "Refugee Arrival" (d100: 1-10)
- Settlement Event "New Arrivals" (from previous session)
- Mission Reward: "Rescued Pilot" (found captive)
- Building: Barracks (unlocks recruitment action)

**Replacement Pilot** (After Death):
- When pilot dies, settlement may recruit replacement
- Cost: 50 Credits + 1 Settlement Action
- Roll on all tables to generate new pilot

**Starting Campaign Pilots** (Session 1):
- Generate 3-5 pilots for player roster
- Mix of backgrounds/traits for variety
- At least one "Survivor" (Grit 1) for experienced pilot

### Progression After Generation

**Pilots change over time**:
- **Gain Grit** (0 → 3 through surviving trauma)
- **Gain Injuries** (Minor → Severe → Permanent → Trauma)
- **Gain/Lose Morale** (affected by success/failure/death)
- **Gain Taint** (0 → 10 = Corruption)
- **Acquire New Quirks** (GM adds through narrative)

**Example Arc**:
- **Session 1**: Brother Tomas (Priest, Reckless+Cautious, Faith-driven, 0 Grit, 2 Morale)
- **Session 5**: (Survived near-death) Gains Grit 1, adds Minor Injury "Broken Ribs"
- **Session 10**: (Witnessed ally die) Gains Grit 2, Morale drops to 0, adds Quirk "Talks to dead pilot's ghost"
- **Session 15**: (Reached 7 Taint) Taint Marks appear on face, other pilots fear him
- **Session 20**: (Defeated boss) Gains Grit 3, Morale back to 2, adds Severe Injury "Spinal Damage", walks with cane outside Casket

---

## Designer's Notes

**Why Hybrid Traits?**
- Creates **contradictions** that feel human (aggressive but cautious, lucky but traumatized)
- Emergent narratives from mechanical tensions
- Players roleplay contradictions ("I want to charge in, but my trait makes me defensive")

**RimWorld Inspiration**:
- RimWorld generates colonists with conflicting traits (Pessimistic Optimist, Lazy Hard Worker)
- Contradiction = personality depth
- Players tell stories about "that one pilot with the weird traits"

**D&D Inspiration**:
- Backgrounds provide narrative hooks for GM
- Motivations drive character arcs
- Quirks make NPCs memorable

**KDM Inspiration**:
- Permanent consequences (scars, injuries, trauma)
- Traits gained through gameplay, not just creation
- Death matters because you invested in character

**Balance Philosophy**:
- Simple traits: +1/-1 trades (balanced, safe)
- Complex traits: High reward, high risk (swingy, exciting)
- Hybrid traits: Unpredictable, create unique builds

**Quirks as Roleplay Fuel**:
- No mechanical effect (usually)
- GM can weave into narrative
- Players add personality through quirks
- Emergent stories ("Remember when the pilot who refuses to remove their helmet got their helmet stuck, and we had to pry it off?")
