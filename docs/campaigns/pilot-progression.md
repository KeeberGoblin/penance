# Pilot Scars & Traits
## Permanent Character Development

**Version**: 0.1
**Last Updated**: October 10, 2025

---

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by Kingdom Death: Monster's Fighting Arts and Disorders, this system creates **permanent, mechanical character development** through brutal experiences. Scars are:
- **Earned through suffering** - trauma, injury, corruption, or triumph
- **Permanently character-defining** - once gained, never lost
- **Mechanically impactful** - alter how you play
- **Narratively rich** - each scar tells a story

---

## How Scars Work

### Acquiring Scars

**Standard Acquisition**:
- Gain 1 Scar after every **3 completed missions** (success or failure)
- **OR** gain 1 Scar immediately when suffering a **traumatic event** (see Triggers below)

**Maximum Scars**: 5 per pilot (after that, you're too broken to continue)

**Choosing Scars**:
- When you earn a Scar, roll 1d20 on the appropriate table
- **OR** if caused by a specific event, GM assigns a thematically appropriate Scar
- **OR** (optional house rule) player chooses from 3 random options

---

## Scar Triggers (Immediate Acquisition)

These events grant immediate Scars, bypassing the "every 3 missions" rule:

| Trigger | Scar Category |
|---------|---------------|
| **Survive at 1-2 HP** for 3+ rounds | Roll on Physical Scars |
| **Reach 8+ Taint** and survive the mission | Roll on Corruption Scars |
| **Witness an ally's death** | Roll on Trauma Scars |
| **Kill 5+ enemies in a single mission** | Roll on Combat Scars |
| **Destroy a settlement building** (even accidentally) | Roll on Trauma Scars |
| **Fail to save a civilian** during escort mission | Roll on Trauma Scars |
| **Make a bargain with a Fae** (Mockingbird) | GM assigns appropriate Scar |
| **Reach The Engine's Core** | Roll on Corruption Scars |

## Scar Categories

### Physical Scars (1d20)
*Your body is broken, but you endure.*

| Roll | Scar Name | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Shattered Leg** | Permanent -1 Movement. You limp, even in your Casket. |
| 2 | **Blinded Eye** | -1 to all ranged attacks beyond Range 2. Depth perception is ruined. |
| 3 | **Crushed Hand** | Cannot equip weapons in Left Arm slot. Your hand is mangled. |
| 4 | **Punctured Lung** | At the start of each mission, start with 1 Heat (labored breathing). |
| 5 | **Nerve Damage** | Whenever you draw a Damage card, take 1 additional Heat. Pain flares constantly. |
| 6 | **Skull Fracture** | -1 Hand Size (draw 1 fewer card). Migraines cloud your judgment. |
| 7 | **Broken Ribs** | Whenever you take 4+ damage in one attack, gain +1 Heat. Every breath hurts. |
| 8 | **Severed Fingers** | -1 Initiative. Your reflexes are shot. |
| 9 | **Scarred Throat** | Cannot speak. Communication during missions is nonverbal only (roleplay penalty). |
| 10 | **Iron Jaw** | **Positive**: +1 Defense, but -1 Movement. You're tougher but slower. |
| 11 | **Reinforced Bones** | **Positive**: When you would take 1-2 damage, reduce it to 1. Your bones mended stronger. |
| 12 | **Adaptive Reflexes** | **Positive**: +1 Initiative, but start each mission with 1 Heat. Your body is always on edge. |
| 13 | **Endurance Conditioning** | **Positive**: +1 SP per turn, but all Strain rolls are at +1 penalty. You push harder, pay later. |
| 14 | **Prosthetic Limb** (Dwarven-made) | **Mixed**: Left Arm slot permanently replaced with Dwarven prosthetic. Cannot change equipment in that slot, but attacks from it deal +1 damage. |
| 15 | **Old Wound** | Once per mission, reroll any 1 die roll. "I've felt worse." |
| 16 | **Battle Scars** | **Positive**: +1 to intimidation checks. Enemies prioritize you (double-edged). |
| 17 | **Survivor's Grit** | **Positive**: When reduced to 5 HP or less, gain +2 to all attack rolls. Desperation fuels you. |
| 18 | **Dead Nerves** | **Mixed**: Immune to pain-based effects, but cannot sense when you're critically injured (GM doesn't tell you HP total). |
| 19 | **Unbreakable** | **Positive**: Once per campaign, survive a killing blow at 1 HP instead. "Not yet." |
| 20 | **Reroll** or **Choose** | You got lucky. Pick any Physical Scar (except Unbreakable). |

### Corruption Scars (1d20)
*The Void has touched you. You are changed.*

| Roll | Scar Name | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Crystalline Growth** | Soulstone crystals grow from your skin. Start each mission at +1 Taint, but gain +1 SP. |
| 2 | **Void Whispers** | You hear voices from the Void. -1 to all saving throws vs Taint effects, but gain insight (ask GM 1 yes/no question per mission). |
| 3 | **Flickering Existence** | Once per mission, you phase out of reality for 1 round (cannot act, cannot be targeted). Uncontrollable. |
| 4 | **Tainted Blood** | Your blood is black. Healing effects on you are reduced by 50%. Apothecary treatments cost double. |
| 5 | **Reality Rejection** | Normal terrain counts as Difficult Terrain for you. Reality doesn't "fit" right anymore. |
| 6 | **Unnatural Hunger** | You crave Soulstone energy. Must consume 1 Soulstone Fragment per settlement phase or gain +1 Taint. |
| 7 | **Warped Reflection** | Mirrors and water show *something else* instead of you. -1 Morale to settlement when you're present. |
| 8 | **Temporal Echo** | Once per mission, after failing a roll, you may "undo" it and rerollâ€”but your past self suffers 2 damage. |
| 9 | **Marked by the Void** | Abominations are drawn to you. On monster AI turns, you're prioritized 50% more often. |
| 10 | **Soulbound** | **Positive**: +1 SP permanently, but if your Casket is destroyed, you die instantly (merged with the machine). |
| 11 | **Void-Touched Vision** | **Positive**: You can see Void rifts and corruption invisible to others. Gain advantage on detecting ambushes. |
| 12 | **Dimensional Slip** | **Positive**: Once per mission, teleport 3 hexes (Mockingbird-style), but take 1 Taint afterward. |
| 13 | **Taint Resistance** | **Positive**: -1 Taint gained from all sources, but your max Taint before corruption is reduced by 1 (max 9 instead of 10). |
| 14 | **Eldritch Insight** | **Positive**: Once per mission, force an enemy to reroll their AI card draw. You predict their moves. |
| 15 | **Living Soulstone** | **Mixed**: Your heart is partially crystallized. You no longer need a Soulstone to pilot (saves credits), but you gain +1 Taint per settlement phase automatically. |
| 16 | **Aberrant Physiology** | **Mixed**: Gain 1 Aberrant-class ability (choose from Aberrant racial traits), but NPCs react with fear/hostility. |
| 17 | **Voidwalker** | **Positive**: Ignore all Void exposure penalties in Sibarian Wastes. You've adapted. |
| 18 | **Uncorrupted Soul** | **Positive**: Max Taint +2 (can go to 12 before transforming). Your will is iron. |
| 19 | **Beyond the Veil** | **Positive**: When you die, you may return as an Undead NPC under GM control (one-time resurrection). |
| 20 | **Reroll** or **Choose** | The Void is fickle. Pick any Corruption Scar (except Beyond the Veil). |

### Trauma Scars (1d20)
*War breaks the mind as surely as the body.*

|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Survivor's Guilt** | -1 Morale to settlement permanently. You can't forgive yourself. |
| 2 | **Cowardice** | When an ally is reduced below 5 HP, you must pass a willpower check or spend your next turn moving away. |
| 3 | **Berserk Rage** | When you take damage, roll 1d6. On 1-2, you must attack the nearest target (even allies) next turn. |
| 4 | **Paranoia** | Cannot accept buffs or healing from allies (you don't trust them). |
| 5 | **Death Wish** | You seek glorious death. -2 Defense, but +2 to all attacks. |
| 6 | **Frozen in Fear** | First round of every mission, you cannot act (PTSD flashback). |
| 7 | **Hallucinations** | Once per mission, GM may tell you false information (you see things that aren't there). |
| 8 | **Trembling Hands** | All attacks have 10% chance to miss (roll 1d10, on 1 = automatic miss, even melee). |
| 9 | **Sleepless** | Cannot recover from injuries during settlement phase (nightmares prevent healing). |
| 10 | **Emotionally Numb** | **Mixed**: Immune to fear and morale penalties, but cannot form bonds with allies (no cooperative abilities). |
| 11 | **Hardened Veteran** | **Positive**: +1 to all saving throws vs fear/morale effects. "I've seen worse." |
| 12 | **Protector Instinct** | **Positive**: +1 Defense when adjacent to an ally. You won't lose another one. |
| 13 | **Cold Calculation** | **Positive**: Can reroll any 1 attack per mission, but must justify it logically (no emotional decisions). |
| 14 | **Unshakeable** | **Positive**: Immune to Trauma effects from AI cards (e.g., "Piercing Shriek" discard effects). |
| 15 | **Martyr Complex** | **Mixed**: When an ally would die, you may take the killing blow instead. Once per mission. You *want* to save them. |
| 16 | **Vengeful** | **Positive**: +2 damage against enemies who have killed your allies. Hatred fuels you. |
| 17 | **Inspiring Presence** | **Positive**: Allies within Range 2 gain +1 Morale. Your courage is contagious. |
| 18 | **Tactical Genius** | **Positive**: Once per mission, grant an ally an extra action (1 SP). You see the battlefield clearly. |
| 19 | **Indomitable Will** | **Positive**: Immune to all Trauma Scars gained in the future. You've hit rock bottom and clawed your way up. |
| 20 | **Reroll** or **Choose** | You process trauma differently. Pick any Trauma Scar (except Indomitable Will). |

### Combat Scars (1d20)
*War has honed you into a weapon.*

| 2 | **Reckless Abandon** | +1 to attacks from the rear, but -1 Defense. You take risks. |
| 3 | **Overcommitted** | Whenever you attack, you must move at least 1 hex forward first (charging mentality). |

## Using Scars in Play

### Roleplay Opportunities
- **Physical Scars**: Describe how your character moves differently, favors one side, or struggles with tasks
- **Corruption Scars**: Roleplay the psychological weight of Void exposure, strange behaviors, or inhuman mannerisms
- **Trauma Scars**: Play out PTSD, survivor's guilt, or reckless bravery

### Mechanical Integration
- Track Scars on your pilot sheet (list all 5 Scars with effects)
- When a Scar triggers, announce it: "My Shattered Leg kicks inâ€”I can only move 2 hexes this turn."
- GMs should remind players of negative Scars when relevant ("Your Paranoia prevents you from accepting that healing.")

### Retirement
When a pilot reaches **5 Scars**, they may choose to **retire** rather than risk death:
- Retired pilots become settlement NPCs (provide passive bonuses)
- Example: Retired "Living Legend" pilot provides +1 Morale permanently
- Frees up the pilot slot for a new character

---

## Design Notes

### Balance Philosophy
- ~40% Negative Scars (pure penalties)
- ~30% Positive Scars (pure bonuses)
- ~30% Mixed Scars (cost + benefit)
- High rolls (18-20) tend to be more positive (rewarding luck)
- Traumatic events tend toward negative Scars (reinforcing harsh world)

### Kingdom Death Inspiration
Like KD:M's Disorders and Fighting Arts, Scars:
- Are permanent and character-defining
- Create emergent narratives ("The Shattered Leg pilot who became a Living Legend")
- Encourage retirement/permadeath cycles
- Make every character unique

*"Your scars tell your story. Wear them with pride, or hide them in shameâ€”either way, they define you."*
