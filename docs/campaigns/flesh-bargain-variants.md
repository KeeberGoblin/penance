# Flesh Bargain: Faction-Specific Variants
## Penance: Campaign Progression System

**Version**: 3.0 (Replaces Generic "Flesh Bargain")
**Last Updated**: October 14, 2025

---

## Overview

**"To make room for the machine, we give up what we cannot bear to lose."**

Each faction has its own method of **Flesh Bargain** — permanent bodily modification to enhance capsule connection. The Church removes legs. The Dwarves shed flesh for metal. The Ossuarium discards rotting meat. The Elves graft with nature. Each sacrifice is unique, reflecting cultural values and physiology.

**Universal Benefits** (all variants grant these):
- +1 SP Maximum
- +2 Heat Capacity
- +1 Deployment Duration
- +1 Grit (permanent willpower bonus from trauma survived)

**Universal Costs** (all variants suffer these):
- Permanent physical disability outside Casket
- Irreversible (cannot be undone)
- Social stigma (faction-dependent)
- 4-8 weeks recovery downtime

## Church of Absolution: THE SHORTENING

**What's Sacrificed**: Both legs (upper thigh amputation, femoral level)

### Procedure
- **Amputation**: Legs removed at hip socket
- **Augmentation**: Hip stumps receive 4-6 neural ports
- **Recovery**: 6-8 weeks
- **Result**: Pilot is 18-24 inches shorter, wheelchair-bound outside Casket

### Church-Specific Benefits
- **Martyrdom Aura** (Passive): Allies within 2 hexes gain +1 to all attacks (inspired by your sacrifice)
- **Stump Override**: Once per mission, ignore one Thread Snap (stumps provide backup motor control)
- **Righteous Fury Boost**: When Shortened Church pilot is reduced to 10 HP or less, gain +2 damage to all attacks (desperation power)
- **Sacred Burden**: Can redirect 1 damage per turn from allies to self (costs 0 SP, automatic)

### Outside Casket
- **Wheelchair-bound** (cannot walk, stand, or climb)
- **Honored by Church** (reverent title "The Shortened", priority healing, better rations)
- **Ceremony**: Public ritual after surgery (Church bells ring, 3-day celebration)

### Narrative Quote
> *"They walked on sinful legs. Now they float in grace. Their sacrifice brings us all closer to Absolution."*

## Dwarven Forge-Guilds: COMPACT FORM (Runic Grafting)

**What's Sacrificed**: Arms and legs (all four limbs removed, replaced with runic sockets)

### Procedure
- **Amputation**: All four limbs removed at elbow/knee
- **Augmentation**: Stumps engraved with runic circuits (Forge-Runes channel Soulstone energy directly)
- **Recovery**: 8-12 weeks (extensive rune-carving)
- **Result**: Pilot is limbless torso with glowing runic stumps, uses hydraulic prosthetics outside Casket

### Dwarf-Specific Benefits
- **Forge-Rune Amplification** (Passive): +1 to all attack rolls (runic circuits enhance Casket response time)
- **Overcharge Protocol**: Spend 2 SP, next attack deals +3 damage and ignores 2 Defense (costs 1 Heat)
- **Runic Stability**: Cannot be knocked down, pulled, or grappled by enemies (Casket roots via rune-connection)
- **Emergency Venting**: When you would take Strain damage from Heat, instead remove 3 Heat and take no damage (once per battle)

### Outside Casket
- **Hydraulic Prosthetics** (functional but slow: movement speed halved)
- **Respected as Engineers** (technical title "Compact Pilot", +10% salary, priority forge access)
- **Can Build Own Prosthetics** (Craft proficiency, dwarven hydraulics are best in class)

### Narrative Quote
> *"Less meat, more metal. That's progress. Why carry weight that doesn't help you fight?"*

## The Ossuarium: EFFICIENT FORM (Flesh Reduction)

**What's Sacrificed**: ALL unnecessary flesh (arms, legs, organs, skin - only skull, spine, and minimal torso remain)

### Procedure
- **Reduction**: Limbs removed, organs replaced with preservative fluid, skin flayed
- **Augmentation**: Spinal column directly wired to capsule, cranial ports added
- **Recovery**: 4 weeks (undead heal faster, no blood loss)
- **Result**: Pilot is floating skull + spine + minimal torso, permanently fused to capsule

### Ossuarium-Specific Benefits
- **Already Dead** (Passive): Immune to Pilot Wound cards (when you take Pilot Damage, add 1 Decay card to HP deck instead of flipping Wound)
- **Soul Harvest Protocol**: Once per turn, spend 2 enemy Taint Markers, recover 3 cards from discard (weaponize corruption)
- **Phylactery Connection**: When your Casket is destroyed, if you have 5+ HP remaining, automatically resurrect at 5 HP (once per battle)
- **Decay Aura Amplified**: Enemies within 3 hexes gain +2 Taint per turn instead of +1 (double corruption radiation)

### Outside Casket
- **Cannot Leave Capsule** (life support dependency, must remain in fluid or die within 1 hour)
- **Total Dependency** (dedicated attendant required 24/7, cost: 40 Credits/month)
- **Efficient Form Respected** (Ossuarium views this as peak evolution, no stigma)

### Narrative Quote
> *"Flesh is waste. Remove it. A skull piloting a Casket is perfection."*

## Elven Verdant Covenant: ROOT-GRAFTING (Nature Fusion)

**What's Sacrificed**: Legs (replaced with living root-limbs grafted to stumps)

### Procedure
- **Amputation**: Legs removed at mid-thigh
- **Augmentation**: Living tree roots grafted to stumps, roots grow INTO bone marrow
- **Recovery**: 6-8 weeks (roots must bond with body, painful process)
- **Result**: Pilot has root-limbs instead of legs (functional but slow, creeping vine movement)

### Elven-Specific Benefits
- **Photosynthesis Integration**: Standing in Forest terrain hexes for 1 full turn, recover 2 HP and remove 1 Taint (once per turn)
- **Root Network Sensing**: Can sense enemy positions within 3 hexes if standing on natural ground (ignore Disadvantage from obscured targets)
- **Thornwhip Strike**: Once per battle, roots lash out dealing 4 damage to all enemies within 2 hexes (ignores Defense, costs 2 SP)
- **Nature's Resilience**: When you would be reduced to 0 HP, if you're in Forest terrain, remain at 1 HP instead (once per battle)

### Outside Casket
- **Root-Limbs Functional** (can walk at half speed, creeping vine gait, silent movement)
- **Cannot Run or Climb** (roots are strong but slow, Athletics checks at Disadvantage)
- **Mourned by Elves** (sorrowful title "The Pruned", stumps carved with memorial runes, treated like funeral)

### Narrative Quote
> *"We cut away the dead wood so the tree may live. But each cut reminds us of what the Sundering took from us."*

## Campaign Integration: Timing & Offer

### When Do Pilots Choose Sacrifice?

**After Mission 5** (first offer):
> Faction specialist approaches pilot:
>
> "You've survived five drops. That's more than most. You're good at this.
>
> I can make you better.
>
> [Faction-specific sacrifice name]. I've done it [number] times. [Recovery time] recovery, then you're back in the capsule stronger, faster, tougher.
>
> Cost: [Credits/Resources]. And [body part], obviously.
>
> Think about it. Other pilots will tell you it's worth it. Some will tell you it ruined them.
>
> Your choice. [Faction-specific pressure]."

**After Mission 10** (second offer, if declined first):
> "Still have those [body parts]? Most pilots don't by now. The offer stands."

**After Mission 15** (third offer, if declined twice):
> "Last time I'll ask. If you haven't done it by now, you probably never will. But if you change your mind, I'll be here."

**After Mission 20+** (extreme variants unlock):
> "You want to go further? I can do that. But there's no coming back from this one."

## Narrative Moments

### Church Shortening Ceremony

> You wake in the Infirmary, legs gone. The drugs wear off. Phantom toes wiggle. Phantom calves itch.
>
> Outside, Church bells ring. The Confessor enters, carrying your severed legs wrapped in white silk.
>
> "You have given flesh to the cause. Your legs will be burned in the Pyre of Absolution. Their ashes will nourish the gardens. Your sacrifice feeds the faithful."
>
> Three days of celebration follow. Strangers bring you gifts—food, wine, soft blankets. Veterans kneel before you, stumps gleaming with fresh oil.
>
> You're one of The Shortened now. Honored. Pitied. Revered. Broken.

### Dwarven Compact Form Ritual

> The Forge-Master carves runes into your stumps with a white-hot chisel. You scream. He does not stop.
>
> "Pain makes the runes stronger," he says. "Scream louder. Let the metal hear your suffering."
>
> When he's done, your stumps glow faintly blue—Forge-Runes etched bone-deep. You can FEEL the Casket now, even from across the room. The connection hums through your marrow.
>
> The Forge-Master hands you hydraulic prosthetics—gold-trimmed, shock-absorbing, perfectly weighted.
>
> "Welcome to Compact Form, pilot. You're 40% more efficient now. Congratulations on your upgrade."

### Ossuarium Flesh Reduction

> They peel your skin off in strips. You watch from above—detached, floating, already dead.
>
> Your arms fall away. Your legs are discarded. Your organs are scooped out and replaced with preservative gel. Your skull is polished clean.
>
> When they lower you back into the capsule, you realize: You cannot leave. Not ever. This is your coffin now.
>
> But you don't care. You're already dead. This is just... tidier.

### Elven Root-Grafting

> The roots burrow into your stumps like worms into soil. You feel them threading through bone, wrapping around marrow, drinking your blood.
>
> The Archdruid sings in Old Tongue. The roots respond—growing, twisting, fusing. By the third day, they've reached your spine.
>
> By the seventh day, you can move them. Slowly. Like learning to walk again, but as a tree.
>
> Other elves look at you with sorrow. They carve memorial runes into your root-limbs—names of forests that burned in the Sundering.
>
> You are The Pruned. A living reminder of what was lost.
