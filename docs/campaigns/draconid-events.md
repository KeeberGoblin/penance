## How Draconid Events Work

### Triggering Draconid Encounters

Draconid events are **rare** and triggered by:

1. **Settlement Event Table**: Roll 95-100 on standard d100 event table (5% chance)
2. **Exploration Events**: When traveling through mountains or ruins
3. **Quest Hooks**: GM-triggered when campaign needs lore exposition or wildcards
4. **Late-Game Integration**: Automatically triggered at mission 7+ for endgame setup

**Design Note**: Draconids should feel **special and impactful**, not random encounters. Use sparingly.

## Draconid Event Table (d20)

When a Draconid event is triggered, roll 1d20:

### 1-4: The Chronicler's Request (Duskwind)

**Event**: A Draconid messenger arrives with a sealed letter from Duskwind the Chronicler. The letter contains a cryptic request: "I need witnesses to an experiment. Survival is optional. Knowledge is guaranteed."

**Location**: Ancient ruins marked on enclosed map (3 hexes from settlement)

**Objective**:
- Travel to ruins and survive Duskwind's "test"
- Duskwind has released a **captured Abomination** (roll on Bestiary for random enemy)
- Players must defeat it while Duskwind records combat data
- Duskwind does NOT intervene (even if players are losing)

**Rewards**:
- **If players win**: Duskwind shares prophecy about upcoming threat (GM reveals 1 future event)
- **If players survive but retreat**: Gain access to Skyhold archives (1 free lore question answered)
- **If players die**: Duskwind records their deaths with melancholic precision ("As expected. Tragic, but predictable.")

**Complications**:
- Duskwind's "test" has **40% mortality rate** historically
- Players who refuse earn Duskwind's disappointment (-1 Reputation with Draconids)
- Duskwind may hire **other pilots** if players refuse (creates rival NPC group)

### 5-8: Library Under Siege (Rhysal)

**Event**: Skykeeper Rhysal sends urgent request for mercenary guards. Vestige Bloodlines raiders have discovered Skyhold's location and plan to raid the archives tonight.

**Location**: Skyhold, the Last Roost (mountain fortress-city)

**Objective**:
- Defend 4 archive vaults from 3 waves of Vestige raiders
- Each vault contains priceless pre-Cataclysm texts
- Rhysal will **sacrifice pilots to save books** (orders suicidal defensive positions)

**Waves**:
- **Wave 1** (Turn 1-3): 3 Vestige Scout Caskets (light, fast, hit-and-run)
- **Wave 2** (Turn 4-6): 2 Vestige Heavy Caskets + 4 Infantry (coordinated assault)
- **Wave 3** (Turn 7+): Vestige Alpha Casket (boss-tier, 40 HP, regeneration)

**Success Conditions**:
- At least 2 vaults protected (50% archives saved)
- Rhysal survives (she pilots defensive Casket if threatened)

**Rewards Based on Performance**:
- **All 4 vaults saved**: Choice of **Legendary Artifact** from archives (player picks from 3 options GM creates)
- **3 vaults saved**: Ancient map revealing Soulstone deposit location
- **2 vaults saved**: Artifact identification service (3 unknown items revealed)
- **1 vault saved**: Payment in Credits only (Rhysal is furious)
- **0 vaults saved**: Rhysal blacklists players from all Draconid territories

**Complications**:
- Rhysal values books over lives (will order players into death traps to save texts)
- Players can **choose to disobey** her orders (save lives, lose books)
- Moral choice: Follow orders = rewards but pilot deaths, Disobey = survival but lower rewards

---

### 9-12: The Duelist's Challenge (Drakthar)

**Event**: Ember-Claws Drakthar appears at settlement gates and issues formal challenge to strongest pilot. Refusal spreads word of cowardice across all factions.

**Location**: Settlement arena or neutral ground (Drakthar chooses)

**Objective**:
- **Honorable 1v1 Duel** between Drakthar and chosen player pilot
- No allies, no items, no interruptions (Drakthar enforces honor code)
- Fight to **yield or unconsciousness** (Drakthar will NOT kill honorable opponents)

**Drakthar's Stats** (Heavy Casket, 35 HP):
- **SP**: 4 per turn
- **Attack**: Crimson Fang (Melee, 3 SP, 7 damage)
- **Breath Weapon**: Fire Breath (4 SP, 4 damage cone, sets targets on fire)
- **Special**: Draconic Fury (3 SP, +3 damage/+2 Defense for 3 turns, then 3 Heat + 2 damage)
- **Weakness**: Arrogance (will not retreat even at low HP)

**Win Conditions**:
- **Player wins**: Gain Drakthar as **ally for 1 mission** (player chooses when to call in favor)
- **Player loses honorably**: Drakthar respects courage, offers **Dragon Scale Shield** as consolation (+2 Defense, fire resistance)
- **Player flees**: Drakthar spreads word of cowardice (-1 Reputation with ALL factions, permanent)
- **Player refuses challenge**: Reputation loss, Drakthar challenges again every 3 missions

**Complications**:
- Drakthar fights with **honor** (no cheap tactics, will heal player to 50% HP if critically wounded mid-duel)
- Players can **try dirty tactics** (ambush, poison, allies) but Drakthar becomes **permanent enemy**
- Other factions watch the duel (outcomes affect Reputation broadly)

### 13-15: The Prophecy of Ash (Duskwind)

**Event**: Duskwind appears in settlement, agitated (rare for him). He's had a vision of the settlement's destruction and demands to speak with leadership immediately.

**Prophecy Content** (GM chooses or rolls d6):
1. **Abomination Raid**: Massive swarm attacks in 3 missions (gives prep time)
2. **Rival Faction Assault**: Hostile faction plans surprise attack (reveals attacker)
3. **Void Rift Opening**: Reality tear will form beneath settlement (must relocate or seal)
4. **Internal Betrayal**: One NPC in settlement is saboteur (Duskwind names suspect)
5. **Economic Collapse**: Trade routes will fail, starvation imminent (must stockpile)
6. **Plague Outbreak**: Taint-corruption disease spreads (quarantine protocols needed)

**Player Choice**:
- **Believe Duskwind**: Take costly preventative measures (spend Credits, time, resources)
- **Ignore Warning**: Risk prophecy coming true unprepared
- **Test Prophecy**: Deliberately trigger conditions to see if he's right (risky)

**Accuracy**: Duskwind's visions are **70% accurate**. Roll d10:
- **1-7**: Prophecy comes true exactly as stated
- **8-9**: Prophecy is partially true (different details but same threat)
- **10**: Prophecy was **self-fulfilling** (taking preventative measures CAUSED the disaster)

**Duskwind's Payment**: He asks for nothing except permission to "record the outcome for posterity." Will document everything, even player failures.

### 16-17: The Fourth Cycle (Late Game - Mission 7+)

**Event**: Duskwind reveals his true plan. He's located a "resonance point" where the fourth Cataclysm could be artificially triggered. He believes the current world is stagnant and needs to be reset.

**Location**: Ancient Engine prototype ruins (pre-Theslar structure from Second Cataclysm)

**Duskwind's Proposal**:
"This world is broken. The cycle failed. Previous Cataclysms led to renewal—civilizations rose stronger from the ashes. But this Sundering has led only to stagnation. 437 years of endless war, no progress, no hope. I can trigger the fourth cycle. Clean slate. A chance for the world to heal properly."

**Player Choices**:

1. **Help Duskwind Trigger It**:
   - Endgame: Activate the resonance point, cause controlled Cataclysm
   - Consequence: World resets (ambiguous ending—unknown if it worked)
   - Reward: Duskwind's gratitude, knowledge of what comes after (uncertain)
   - Moral Weight: Billions die, but potentially save trillions in future cycles

2. **Stop Duskwind**:
   - Endgame: Assault on resonance point, fight Duskwind to prevent activation
   - Consequence: Preserve current broken world
   - Reward: Heroes who "saved the world" (from perspective of current inhabitants)
   - Moral Weight: Condemn future generations to perpetual stagnation

3. **Negotiate Alternative**:
   - Endgame: Find third option (stabilize Theslar Engine, heal Void rifts)
   - Consequence: Attempt to break the cycle WITHOUT Cataclysm
   - Reward: Unknown (unprecedented outcome)
   - Moral Weight: Risk failure of both options (world neither resets nor heals)

**Duskwind Boss Fight** (If opposed):
- **HP**: 45 (Heavy Casket with Dragon Heart Soulstone)
- **Cyclical Revelation**: Once per round, gains perfect counter to player tactics
- **Breath Weapon**: Lightning (6-hex line, 5 damage, ignore cover)
- **Ancestral Memory**: Can summon ghostly dragon projections (2 minions, 15 HP each)
- **Final Words** (if defeated): "I've seen this before too. History repeats. You'll realize I was right... in another 437 years."

### 18-19: Archive Access Granted (Rhysal)

**Event**: After proving trustworthy (completed 2+ Draconid quests), Rhysal grants players limited access to Skyhold's Grand Archives.

**Benefit**: Players may ask **3 lore questions** and receive truthful, comprehensive answers.

**Example Questions**:
- "Where is the nearest Soulstone deposit?"
- "What are the weaknesses of [enemy faction]?"
- "How do we destroy the Theslar Engine?"
- "What happened to [historical figure]?"
- "Are the Soulstones really [Church theory / Elven theory / Dwarven theory]?"

**Limitations**:
- Rhysal will **not** answer questions about the future (only past/present)
- She will **not** share Draconid military secrets
- She will **not** reveal locations of Dragon Heart Soulstones (too valuable)

**Cost**: Players must donate **1 rare artifact or pre-Cataclysm text** to archives.

**Complication**: Knowledge comes with burden. Some truths may shatter player beliefs (e.g., learning Church dogma is wrong, Soulstones aren't what they think).

### 20: The Dragon's Gift (Critical Success)

**Event**: After earning exceptional reputation with Draconids (completed 5+ quests, high honor), the Skykeepers vote to grant players a singular honor: **A Dragon Heart Shard**.

**Dragon Heart Shard**:
- **Superior Soulstone** (most powerful type)
- Player chooses **ONE permanent upgrade**:
  - **+5 Max HP** (install in Casket core)
  - **+1 to any stat permanently** (Damage, Defense, Movement, or SP)
  - **Elemental Resistance** (choose Fire, Cold, or Lightning—reduce damage by 50%)
  - **Breath Weapon Module** (gain 1 Draconid breath weapon card, usable 1/mission)

**Ceremony**: Formal presentation at Skyhold. All three Draconid NPCs attend. Duskwind records the moment. Rhysal catalogs the gift. Drakthar challenges player to friendly sparring match (no stakes, pure sport).

**Consequence**: Other factions learn of this honor. Some reactions:
- **Church**: Suspicious (why are dragons favoring you?)
- **Dwarves**: Impressed (Draconids rarely share such gifts)
- **Vestige Bloodlines**: Jealous (they covet Dragon Hearts)
- **Wyrd Conclave**: Amused (Draconids showing favoritism is unusual)

**Long-Term Hook**: Players become **marked by Draconids**. Future Draconid events automatically include them (for better or worse).

## GM Integration Tips

### Early Game (Missions 1-3)
- **Use**: Rumors and distant sightings only
- **Goal**: Build mystery ("dragon-men in the mountains")
- **Event**: None yet (too early)

### Mid Game (Missions 4-6)
- **Use**: First contact (Archive Access or Duelist's Challenge)
- **Goal**: Establish Draconids as neutral power brokers
- **Event**: 10% chance per settlement phase

### Late Game (Missions 7+)
- **Use**: The Fourth Cycle revelation
- **Goal**: Force endgame moral choice
- **Event**: Triggered automatically by GM

### Campaign Finale
- **Duskwind's Plan**: Central to endgame (reset world vs preserve world)
- **Player Choice**: Determines final mission and ending
- **Legacy**: Regardless of choice, Draconids survive (they always do)
