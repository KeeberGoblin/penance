# Faction Relationship Tracker
## Political Web & Grudge System

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by Kingdom Death's **intimacy and rivalry** mechanics, this system tracks:
- **Complex relationships** - factions don't simply "hate" or "ally" with each other
- **Historical grudges** - past events create ongoing friction
- **Player influence** - your actions shift the political landscape
- **Asymmetric dynamics** - Faction A's view of Faction B may differ from B's view of A

---

## Relationship Scale

Faction relationships are rated on a **7-tier scale**:

| Tier | Relationship | Mechanical Effect |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **+3** | **Allied** | Provide military aid, share resources freely, offer safe harbor |
| **+2** | **Friendly** | Trade at discounted prices (-20%), provide intel, minor assistance |
| **+1** | **Cordial** | Neutral trade, won't attack unprovoked, tolerate presence |
| **0** | **Neutral** | Default state. Cold but professional. No bonuses or penalties. |
| **-1** | **Suspicious** | Trade at inflated prices (+20%), spread rumors, passive obstruction |
| **-2** | **Hostile** | Refuse trade, sabotage missions, send bounty hunters |
| **-3** | **War** | Active military conflict, kill-on-sight, total embargo |

## Detailed Faction Dynamics

### Church of Absolution (Humans)

**Philosophy**: "Taint is sin. Soulstones are cursed. Redemption through suffering."

#### Relationships:

**vs. Verdant Covenant (-1 Suspicious)**
- **Why**: Elves worship the "Worldheart" instead of the Creator. Heresy.
- **Friction Points**: Competing for same territories, ideological incompatibility
- **Historical Grudge**: Elves sheltered Taint-corrupted refugees the Church wanted to execute (Year 87)
- **Potential Alliance**: If Void threat grows severe enough, temporary ceasefire possible

**vs. Forge-Guilds (0 Neutral)**
- **Why**: Dwarves sell weapons to the Church but mock their religion
- **Friction Points**: Church wants free aid (charity), Dwarves demand payment (business)
- **Trade**: Church buys Dwarven equipment at standard prices
- **Tension**: Dwarves refuse to build "holy relics" (won't participate in superstition)

**vs. Scrap-Clans (-2 Hostile)**
- **Why**: Orcs raid Church settlements, don't respect "sacred law"
- **Friction Points**: Orcs view Church as weak, Church views Orcs as barbaric
- **Historical Grudge**: Orcish warlord "Graul the Unrepentant" burned the Cathedral of Chains (Year 93)
- **Ongoing Conflict**: Border skirmishes, bounty hunters, retaliatory raids

**vs. Bone-Courts (-3 War)**
- **Why**: Undead are abominations in Church doctrine. Necromancy is ultimate sin.
- **Friction Points**: EVERYTHING. Theological incompatibility.
- **Historical Grudge**: The Undead view the Church as "wasteful" (all those corpses, unused!)
- **Active Conflict**: Church sends Crusades into Bone-Marches regularly. Undead retaliate with plague-corpse catapults.

**vs. Twilight Courts (-2 Hostile)**
- **Why**: Fae make deals that corrupt souls. Church sees them as devils.
- **Friction Points**: Fae trick desperate believers into bargains, undermining Church authority
- **Historical Grudge**: Fae replaced an entire town's population with doppelgangers (Year 78). Church noticed too late.
- **Tension**: Church Inquisition hunts Fae-touched individuals

**vs. Draconid Remembrance (+1 Cordial)**
- **Why**: Draconids are neutral, scholarly, not actively blasphemous
- **Friction Points**: Draconids know the Church's origin story is wrong (they were there). They politely don't mention it.
- **Trade**: Church buys historical texts from Draconids
- **Respect**: Draconids are old enough to be dangerous - Church doesn't provoke them

---

### Verdant Covenant (Elves)

**Philosophy**: "The world is alive. Harmonize with it, or be pruned."

#### Relationships:

**vs. Church of Absolution (-1 Suspicious)**
- **Why**: Church clear-cuts forests for lumber, poisons rivers with runoff
- **Friction Points**: Environmental destruction vs. civilization's needs
- **Historical Grudge**: Church declared the Grove of First Light a "heretical sanctuary" (Year 91)

**vs. Forge-Guilds (-1 Suspicious)**
- **Why**: Dwarven mining scars the earth, disrupts ley lines
- **Friction Points**: Industry vs. nature
- **Trade**: Minimal. Elves trade rare herbs, Dwarves trade tools. Both grudgingly.
- **Tension**: One Dwarven mine collapsed a ley line nexus (Year 82). Elves haven't forgotten.

**vs. Scrap-Clans (0 Neutral)**
- **Why**: Orcs live in wastelands Elves don't want anyway
- **Friction Points**: Occasional border disputes, but no sustained conflict
- **Odd Respect**: Orcs don't pretend to be civilized. Elves appreciate the honesty.

**vs. Bone-Courts (-2 Hostile)**
- **Why**: Undead twist the natural cycle of life and death
- **Friction Points**: Necromancy is ecological violation (corpses should decompose and feed the soil)
- **Historical Grudge**: Undead raised an entire Elven burial grove as skeletons (Year 89). Unforgivable.

**vs. Twilight Courts (+1 Cordial)**
- **Why**: Fae respect nature (in their own twisted way). Shared interest in dimensional ecology.
- **Friction Points**: Fae are unpredictable, dangerous
- **Alliance**: Elves and Fae occasionally cooperate against industrial factions
- **Tension**: Elves know better than to trust Fae, but they're useful allies

**vs. Draconid Remembrance (+2 Friendly)**
- **Why**: Draconids also remember the Old World's mistakes. Shared long-term perspective.
- **Friction Points**: None, really. Both are isolationist and patient.
- **Trade**: Knowledge exchange, historical records
- **Mutual Respect**: Both factions are ancient and wise

### Forge-Guilds (Dwarves)

**Philosophy**: "The Cataclysm was an engineering failure. Fix it with better engineering."

#### Relationships:

- **Friction Points**: Church wants charity, Dwarves want profit
- **Trade**: Robust. Church is a major customer.

**vs. Verdant Covenant (-1 Suspicious)**
- **Why**: Elves oppose mining, industry, progress
- **Friction Points**: Resource extraction vs. environmental protection

- **Tension**: Cold war. No open conflict, but lots of passive sabotage.

**vs. Scrap-Clans (+1 Cordial)**
- **Why**: Orcs buy Dwarven weapons (or steal them and reverse-engineer them). Dwarves respect Orcish ingenuity.
- **Friction Points**: Orcs don't *pay* for goods, they "acquire" them
- **Trade**: One-sided. Orcs raid, Dwarves pursue, eventually Orcs pay compensation (in salvage)
- **Odd Respect**: Dwarves admire Orcish scrap-tech. "Crude, but functional."

**vs. Bone-Courts (0 Neutral)**
- **Why**: Undead buy equipment, don't haggle, pay on time. Model customers.

**vs. Twilight Courts (-1 Suspicious)**

#### Relationships:

**vs. Church of Absolution (-2 Hostile)**
- **Why**: Church settlements are soft targets for raids
- **Friction Points**: Orcs need resources, Church has them

If a faction reaches **total dominance** (Allied with players, destroyed all rivals), the campaign ends:

**Church Victory**: "The Age of Absolution"
- Taint is purged, but magic dies. Technological dark age.

**Covenant Victory**: "The Green Harmony"
- World becomes feral paradise. Civilization collapses into druidic communes.

**Forge Victory**: "The Industrial Epoch"
- Dwarves stabilize the Engine. Magic is industrialized. Dystopian technocracy.

**Scrap Victory**: "The Eternal Krush"
- Warlords rule. Might makes right. Brutal but free.

**Bone Victory**: "The Deathless Empire"
- Undead achieve true immortality. Living become irrelevant.

**Fae Victory**: "The Endless Bargain"
