# Species Demographics & Evolutionary Biology

**The Divergent Descendants of Humanity**

> *"We are all human. We simply forgot we came from the same ancestors. 50,000 years of isolation made us strangers."*
> — Dr. Helena Vasquez, Pre-Sundering anthropologist (Year -42)

## Overview: Speciation Through Isolation

Before the Theslar Event, humanity was not one species—it was **six distinct subspecies** of *Homo sapiens*, each adapted to extreme environments over 50,000+ years of geographic isolation. What fantasy calls "dwarves" and "elves" are actually **evolutionary divergences** shaped by volcanic caverns, ancient forests, and isolated ecosystems.

The Sundering forced these subspecies into contact for the first time in millennia. They don't recognize each other as kin. They see aliens.

## The Six Subspecies of Homo Sapiens

### 1. Homo sapiens sapiens (Baseline Humans)

**Common Names**: Humans, Baseline, "The Unchanged"

**Evolutionary Origin**:
- Remained in temperate surface environments (Europe, Asia, Americas)
- No extreme environmental pressures
- Retained ancestral *Homo sapiens* phenotype

**Physical Characteristics**:
- **Height**: 5'4" - 6'2" (160-188 cm)
- **Skin**: Full melanin range (pale to dark brown)
- **Hair**: All colors, grows continuously
- **Eyes**: Brown, blue, green, hazel
- **Lifespan**: 60-80 years (pre-Sundering)
- **Build**: Medium frame, generalist physiology

**Adaptations**:
- None (baseline phenotype)
- Greatest genetic diversity
- Highly adaptable behavior

**Population** (Year 437 Post-Sundering):
- **8.2 million** (~68% of global survivors)
- Dominant demographic in: Church, Ossuarium, Exchange, Nomads

**Cultural Notes**:
- Most factions are primarily baseline human
- No biological differences between Church/Ossuarium/Exchange members
- "Human" is a cultural identity, not a separate species

### 2. Homo sapiens subterra (Dwarves)

**Common Names**: Dwarves, Forge-Kin, The Deep Folk, Stone-Born

**Evolutionary Origin**: ~50,000 BCE - ~Year -5,000
- Descended into volcanic cavern systems in the Alps and Caucasus Mountains
- Lived 500-2,000 meters underground for 45,000+ years
- Adapted to geothermal heat, low oxygen, darkness, and volcanic gases

**Physical Characteristics**:

- **Ash-gray to charcoal-black** (melanin loss + volcanic ash exposure)
- Thick, heat-resistant dermis (3x human epidermis thickness)
- Naturally sooty appearance from constant volcanic particulates

- Tattoos glow faintly in forge-light (phosphorescent compounds)

**Hair**:
- **Completely hairless** (head, face, body)
- Hair follicles atrophied over 40,000 years
- Eyebrows/eyelashes vestigial or absent
- Cultural practice: Runic scalp tattoos replace hair as identity marker

**Eyes**:
- **Reflective tapetum lucidum** (like cats - light-gathering)
- Eye colors: Amber, copper, deep red (hemoglobin-rich retinas)
- Nictitating membrane (third eyelid for volcanic ash protection)
- Sensitive to bright light (sunglasses required on surface)

**Build**:
- **Height**: 4'2" - 4'10" (127-147 cm) - **stocky, not "short and stout"**

- **Bone density**: 40% denser than baseline human (silicate-calcium matrix)
- Barrel-chested (increased lung capacity for thin air)

- Concentrated in Forge-Guild territories (Alpine fortresses)

**Cultural Identity**:
- Facial tattoos indicate clan, rank, and craft specialization
- Runesmith tattoos are most intricate (master craftsmen)
- Smooth skin considered "unmarked" (childlike/unproven)
- Beardlessness is NOT a flaw—it's ancestral

## Biological Compatibility & Interbreeding

### Can Different Subspecies Reproduce?

**Yes, but with complications:**

| Cross | Fertility | Offspring Viability | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Human × Human | 100% | 100% | Baseline |
| Human × Dwarf | 60% | 80% | Hybrid offspring common (medium height, partial heat resistance) |
| Human × Elf | 40% | 60% | Rare (photosynthesis trait unstable, often stillborn) |
| Human × Goblinoid | 30% | 50% | Very rare (metabolic incompatibility) |
| Human × Desert-Adapted | 95% | 95% | Nearly identical genetics |
| Dwarf × Elf | <5% | <20% | Biologically incompatible (volcanic vs forest adaptation) |
| Elf × Goblinoid | <10% | <30% | Symbiotic fungi reject goblinoid thermoregulation |

**Cultural Taboos**:
- Most factions consider interbreeding "diluting bloodlines"
- Exchange allows it (pragmatic eugenics programs)
- Nomads practice it (survival > purity)

---

## Extinction Threats

### Critically Endangered: Homo sapiens polaris (Frostborn)

**Pre-Sundering Population**: ~2.5 million
**Year 437 Population**: ~50,000 (98% decline)

**Causes**:
1. **Theslar Event epicenter** was North Pole (their homeland)
2. Arctic survivors fled south (heat intolerance)
3. Genetic bottleneck (inbreeding depression)
4. Low birth rates in temperate climates

**Prognosis**: Extinction within 200 years without intervention

---

### Vulnerable: Homo sapiens silvanus (Elves)

**Threat**: Deforestation + Void corruption destroying sacred groves

**Year 437 Status**:
- 40% of ancestral forests destroyed
- Mycorrhizal networks collapsing
- Elves who lose grove connection suffer **"The Withering"** (slow death)

**Prognosis**: Stable if remaining forests protected

### Catastrophic Scenario (Engine Failure):
- **Total Population**: 0 (Void consumes reality)

## GM Notes: Using Subspecies in Play

**Physical Traits Are Visible:**
- Dwarven ash-skin and tattoos are instantly recognizable
- Elven green tint and bark patches mark them as "other"
- Desert-Adapted bronze skin distinguishes Nomads

**Mechanical Implications:**
- Dwarves: +1 Heat Resistance, -1 Bright Light Penalty
- Elves: +1 Regeneration (regrow 1 card/mission in sunlight), -1 Cold Resistance
- Goblinoids: +1 Speed, -1 Endurance
- Desert-Adapted: +1 Endurance, -1 Cold Resistance

**Roleplay Hooks:**
- "You're a Dwarf. The Church doesn't trust Dwarves. They think your volcanic heritage taints you."
- "As an Elf, you feel the forest screaming. Every tree felled is pain."
- "Goblinoids live fast, die young. You're 38—ancient by your people's standards."

**Cross-Subspecies Tensions:**
- Dwarves vs Elves: "You worship dirt. We worship fire."
- Humans vs Non-Humans: "We survived without mutations. You needed crutches."
- All vs Vestige: "You're not evolution. You're corruption."
