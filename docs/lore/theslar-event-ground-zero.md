# The Theslar Event - Ground Zero

**Location**: Arctic Circle, approximately 89.5° N, 142° W (former North Pole region)
**Date**: Year 0, Day 0, 14:32 UTC
**Designation**: "The Scar" / "The Wound" / "The Engine's Grave"

---

## The Detonation Site

### Pre-Sundering Location

**Theslar Research Station** (Year -5 to Year 0):
- Remote Arctic research facility built on ice shelf
- 2,400 miles from nearest settlement (Barrow, Alaska)
- Population: 127 scientists, 43 support staff, 12 security personnel
- **Purpose**: Testing the Theslar Engine prototype (classified as "clean energy research")
- **Isolation**: Intentionally remote to avoid civilian casualties "in case of failure"

**Why the North Pole?**
- Minimal magnetic interference (proximity to magnetic north pole)
- Isolation from population centers (safety protocols)
- Theslar believed polar conditions would "stabilize dimensional frequencies"
- Access to deep ice core samples (ancient materials for Engine construction)

## Year 0, Day 0: The Activation

### Timeline of Catastrophe

**14:15 UTC** - Final activation sequence begins
- Dr. Nikolas Theslar initiates amplification chamber
- Engine reaches 40% power (within normal parameters)
- Monitoring stations worldwide detect "anomalous readings"

**14:28 UTC** - Power surge detected
- Engine jumps from 40% to 87% in 4 seconds (uncontrolled acceleration)
- Theslar attempts emergency shutdown (fails)
- Final transmission: *"It's not generating power—it's amplifying something already there. Something vast. Oh god. It's singing. IT'S SINGING—"*

**14:32 UTC** - Detonation
- Engine breaches 100% (theoretical maximum)
- Reality puncture occurs
- Arctic ice shelf vaporizes instantly (12 square miles)
- Blast wave expands at 4,500 mph
- **Everyone at Theslar Station dies instantly** (182 souls consumed)

**14:32:03 UTC** - The Void Opens
- Three-dimensional tear in spacetime opens above detonation site
- Void energy floods into reality (described as "un-light" by survivors who saw it from afar)
- Electromagnetic pulse disables all electronics within 3,000 miles
- Aurora borealis distorts into permanent crimson aurora (visible worldwide)

## Immediate Global Impact

### First Hour (14:32-15:32 UTC)

**Geophysical Catastrophe**:
- **Magnetic pole shift**: North magnetic pole moves 847 miles south in 8 minutes
- **Tectonic destabilization**: Void energy disrupts Earth's core, triggering earthquakes globally
- **Volcanic awakening**: 214 dormant volcanoes erupt simultaneously (Crucible Packs' Ashveil Caldera among them)
- **Tidal disruption**: Polar ice vaporization triggers 200-foot tsunami in Arctic Ocean

**Atmospheric Chaos**:
- Ash and debris ejected into stratosphere (begins global "Ashfall Winter")
- Polar vortex collapses (Arctic weather patterns destabilize)
- **The Scar**: Permanent crimson aurora forms over detonation site (visible from equator)
- Void radiation spreads via upper atmosphere (begins global corruption)

**Technological Collapse**:
- EMP disables 94% of electronic devices globally
- Communication networks fail (radio, internet, satellites)
- Power grids cascade-fail within 6 hours
- Modern civilization effectively ends in first 24 hours

## First Week (Day 0-7)

### The Die-Off

**Estimated casualties**:
- **Day 0**: 1.2 billion dead (immediate disasters: tsunamis, earthquakes, building collapses)
- **Day 1-3**: 3.4 billion dead (exposure, fires, panic, infrastructure collapse)
- **Day 4-7**: 2.1 billion dead (starvation, dehydration, violence)
- **Total by Day 7**: 6.7 billion of 7.5 billion humans dead (89% mortality rate)

**Survival zones**:
- Deep underground shelters (military bunkers, subway systems, mines)
- Remote rural communities (less dependent on infrastructure)
- Volcanic regions (ironically safer due to existing geothermal systems)
- Pre-industrial societies (already adapted to living without electricity)

### First Void Manifestations

**Abominations Appear** (Day 3-7):
- Void-corrupted animals emerge from the Scar (twisted, wrong, hungry)
- First reported "shambler" attacks (former humans exposed to Void radiation)
- Reality warps near detonation site (time dilation, spatial distortions)

**The First Soul-Binding** (Day 6):
- Dr. Bonelord Karath (formerly Dr. Marcus Karathis, mechanical engineer)
- Trapped in collapsing research facility, discovers corpse can power machinery via "soul discharge"
- Binds his deceased wife Elena's soul to experimental exosuit (first Casket)
- **Founding moment of the Ossuarium**

---

## First Year (Year 0, Months 1-12)

### Climate Transformation

**Ashfall Winter** (Months 1-8):
- Global temperatures drop 15°C (27°F) due to volcanic ash blocking sunlight
- "Nuclear winter" conditions (but caused by Engine + volcanoes, not nukes)
- Most crops fail (estimated 95% agricultural collapse)
- Survivors forced underground or into heated shelters

**The Thaw** (Months 9-12):
- Ash settles, temperatures rise slightly (still 8°C below pre-Sundering average)
- New weather patterns emerge: Void storms, ash rain, crimson lightning
- Seasons become unpredictable (volcanic activity + Void interference)

### Political Collapse

**Pre-Sundering nations dissolve**:
- Governments vanish (leadership dead, communication impossible)
- Military fragments into warlord factions
- Cities abandoned (too dangerous without infrastructure)
- Survivors organize into tribal groups (proto-factions)

**Faction Genesis**:
- Church of Absolution forms from religious survivor camps
- Dwarven Forge-Guilds coalesce from mining communities
- Nomad Collective emerges from wandering refugee groups
- Crucible Packs (goblinoids) survive in volcanic lava tubes

## Current State of Ground Zero (Year 437)

### The Scar

**Physical Description**:
- Massive crater: 23 miles wide, 4 miles deep
- Flooded with Void energy (glowing purple-black liquid, not water)
- **The Engine's Corpse**: Twisted remnants of Theslar Engine visible at crater center (still humming)
- Reality is unstable (space warps, time dilates, physics breaks down)

**The Crimson Aurora**:
- Permanent aurora borealis centered over Scar
- Visible from anywhere on Earth (cultural landmark)
- Color shifts based on Void activity: red (stable), purple (storm brewing), black (incursion imminent)
- Called "Theslar's Scream" by Church, "The Wound" by Elves, "The First Forge's Scar" by Crucible

**Danger Level**: Forbidden Zone
- No faction controls the Scar (too dangerous)
- Void radiation lethal within 50 miles
- Abominations spawn constantly (endless tide from Void breach)
- Rare expeditions return with Void-corrupted minds or not at all

### The Pilgrimage

**Suicide Missions**:
- Some factions send expeditions to Ground Zero (seeking answers, artifacts, or penance)
- **Church of Absolution**: Considers pilgrimage to Scar ultimate atonement (death is expected)
- **Dwarven engineers**: Attempt to study Engine remnants (hoping to understand dimensional saturation technology)
- **Bonelord Karath**: Theorizes that destroying the Engine would "close the Void" (unproven)

**Recovered Artifacts**:
- Theslar Engine components (extremely rare, priceless to researchers)
- Void-tainted materials (used in advanced Casket construction, highly unstable)
- Pre-Sundering tech preserved in ice (electronics, weapons, data storage)

## Theories About the Engine

### Scientific Perspective (Dwarven Forge-Guilds)

**What Theslar Built**:
- Dimensional amplifier designed to tap "zero-point energy" (vacuum energy)
- Accidentally tuned to wrong frequency (resonated with Void instead of spacetime)
- **Theory**: Void is "outside" reality, existing in quantum foam beneath spacetime
- **Theslar's Mistake**: He punched a hole in the fabric of reality itself

**Can It Be Fixed?**
- Some Dwarven engineers believe Engine can be repaired and *reversed*
- Would require reaching Ground Zero (impossible)
- Risk: Activating Engine again might widen the Void breach instead of closing it

### Religious Perspective (Church of Absolution)

**Divine Punishment**:
- Theslar committed ultimate sin: "playing God"
- The Scar is proof of God's wrath (cannot be undone by mortals)
- **Church Doctrine**: Only atonement and penance can earn forgiveness, not technology
- Pilgrimage to Scar is spiritual journey (those who return are "baptized in fire and Void")

### Crucible Perspective (Goblinoid Fire Cult)

**The First Forge Speaks**:
- Theslar awakened the First Forge (volcano deity)
- Eruptions worldwide were deity's response (testing followers)
- **The Scar is sacred** (proof the First Forge has physical form)
- Crucible shamans believe getting closer to Scar grants visions (usually fatal)

## Legacy of Ground Zero

### What Changed

**Before Theslar Event**:
- Stable climate, functional civilization, 7.5 billion humans
- Technology-dependent society (electricity, internet, global trade)
- Unified geopolitics (nations, borders, international law)

**After Theslar Event (437 years later)**:
- Chaotic climate, tribal factions, ~800,000 humans remaining
- Soul-powered Caskets replace electricity (necromancy is new technology)
- Fractured world (factions war over resources, no unified government)

### The Unanswered Question

**Can the Void be closed?**
- No one knows if destroying Engine would seal the breach
- No one has survived close enough to Engine to attempt sabotage
- **The Scar persists** (437 years and still radiating Void energy)

**Current Year (437)**: The Void grows stronger
- Abomination incursions increasing in frequency
- Some factions believe "the end is approaching" (apocalyptic prophecies)
- Others seek to harness Void power (dangerous experiments)

## Gameplay Integration

### Campaign Hooks

**Quest: Reach Ground Zero**
- Late-game mission: Players attempt pilgrimage to the Scar
- Multi-stage campaign (fight through Void-corrupted wastelands)
- **Reward**: Access to Theslar Engine fragments (legendary relics)
- **Risk**: Void corruption, madness, death

**Quest: Study the Aurora**
- Players investigate Crimson Aurora for faction (Church, Dwarves, Crucible)
- Discover Void storm approaching (aurora turns black)
- **Choice**: Warn factions (defensive alliance) OR exploit chaos (opportunistic)

**Quest: Engine Fragment Scavenging**
- Rare Engine components found in Arctic expeditions
- Players compete with rival factions to claim artifacts
- **Moral dilemma**: Keep for self, sell to Exchange, or destroy (prevent misuse)

---

## The Scar in 437 Years

**The Wound Never Heals**:
- 437 years since detonation, Void breach shows no signs of closing
- Engine still hums (audible for 100 miles, drives listeners mad)
- Some believe the Scar will expand until it consumes the world
- Others believe it's already consumed the world (reality is Void-corrupted dream)

**The Crimson Aurora persists**:
- Every night, the world looks up and sees proof of humanity's failure
- A permanent reminder: *We did this. We broke the world.*
