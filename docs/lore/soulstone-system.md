## What Are Soulstones?

**Soulstones** are crystalline formations that contain **trapped human souls**. They are the power source for all Casket technology, providing bioelectric energy to drive hydraulics, servos, and systems.

But they are not mere batteries. They are **prisons for consciousness**.

---

## The Three Forms of Soulstones

### 1. Natural Formation

**Where They Come From:**
- Souls that escape into the Void during failed binding attempts
- Consciousness fragments from destroyed Caskets
- Echoes of mass death events (battlefields, disasters)
- Spontaneous crystallization around Void rifts

**Appearance:**
- Jagged, irregular crystal formations
- Purple-green gradient (Void energy signature)
- **Eerie Detail:** When viewed from certain angles, the crystal facets form a **distorted screaming face**
  - Not carved or artificial—the soul's agony literally shapes the crystal
  - Different angles show different expressions (terror, rage, despair)
  - Some crystals show multiple faces (soul fragments merged together)

**Size by Tier:**

| Tier | Size | Energy | Souls Inside |
|------|------|--------|--------------|
| **T1 Shard** | Thumbnail | 5 Energy | Soul fragment (partial consciousness) |
| **T2 Fragment** | Fist-sized | 15 Energy | Soul echo (degraded consciousness) |
| **T3 Crystal** | Grapefruit | 40 Energy | Fresh soul (recently bound) |
| **T4 Core** | Melon | 100 Energy | Intact soul (bound at death) |

### 2. Bound Cores (The Primary Power Source)

**What They Are:**
- Soulstone containing **one primary soul** (captured at moment of death)
- Mounted on the **back of the Casket** (standardized socket)
- Powers all casket systems continuously
- Degrades over time as energy is consumed

**The Chimera Process:**
- To prevent burnout, Cores are "fed" smaller Soulstone Shards
- Refinement crushes Shards, releasing trapped soul fragments
- Core soul **absorbs/merges** with the fragments (soul cannibalism)
- Over dozens of refinements, the Core becomes a **patchwork chimera** of consumed consciousnesses

**Visual Appearance:**
- Glows continuously (purple/green pulsing light)
- **Fresh Core:** Single distorted face visible, bright glow, stable pulse
- **Mid-Life Core:** Multiple overlapping faces, flickering glow, irregular pulse
- **Dying Core:** Dozens of fragmented faces, dim glow, erratic pulse, visible cracks

### 3. Faction-Refined Cores (Shaped for Aesthetics)

While **natural Soulstones** are jagged and chaotic, most factions **refine the crystal shape** to match their cultural identity:

| Faction | Refined Shape | Philosophy |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Church of Absolution** | Cross/reliquary shape, gold filigree cage | "We consecrate the souls before consumption. Their suffering is purified through prayer." |
| **Dwarven Forge-Guilds** | Geometric polyhedron, runic etchings on each facet | "Precise cuts maximize energy efficiency. The runes stabilize the amalgamation." |
| **The Ossuarium** | Skull-shaped crystal, hollow eye sockets glow | "We embrace what we are. The faces in the crystal deserve to be seen." |
| **Elven Verdant Covenant** | Teardrop/seed shape, wrapped in living vines | "We mourn every soul consumed. The vines remind us this is unnatural." |
| **The Exchange** | Coin/medallion shape, stamped with serial number | "Standardized formats ensure resale value. This is inventory, not art." |
| **Nomad Collective** | Irregular/unrefined, wrapped in scrap cloth | "We don't have time to make it pretty. Just crush it and move on." |
| **Wyrd Conclave** | Impossible geometry, shifts shape when observed | "The souls are already fragmenting reality. We let them." |
| **Vestige Bloodlines** | Organic/tooth-like, embedded in bio-flesh | "The Core grows with us. It's part of our evolution now." |
| **Emergent Syndicate** | Honeycomb cluster, multiple small cores networked | "Individual souls are obsolete. We pool them into collective nodes." |
| **Crucible Packs** | Bomb-shaped, fuse wire attachment | "If the Core overloads, at least it explodes beautifully." |

**Important Note:**
- The **shape changes** but the **screaming faces remain**
- Faction refinement is cosmetic/cultural, not functional
- The soul inside still suffers regardless of crystal shape

## Soulstone Energy Mechanics

### Energy Pool Tracking

Every Casket has a **Soulstone Core** with a tracked **Energy Pool**:

| Status | Energy Level | Performance |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Full** | 100/100 | Optimal performance, no penalties |
| **Healthy** | 60-99/100 | Normal operation |
| **Depleted** | 20-59/100 | -1 to all pilot checks, +1 Heat per turn |
| **Critical** | 1-19/100 | -2 to all pilot checks, +2 Heat per turn, risk of shutdown |
| **Empty** | 0/100 | **Casket inoperable**, cannot deploy until recharged |

### Energy Depletion (Per Mission)

Caskets consume energy during operations:

| Activity | Energy Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| **Standard Deployment** | -2 Energy (normal mission) |
| **Heavy Combat** | -5 Energy (extended fighting, multiple enemies) |
| **Overheating** | -3 Energy (each time Heat reaches maximum) |
| **Critical Damage** | -5 Energy (when reduced to 10 HP or less) |
| **Emergency Overcharge** | -10 to -15 Energy (player-activated abilities) |

**Example:**
- Casket starts mission at 80/100 Energy
- Heavy combat (-5), Overheated twice (-6), Critical damage once (-5)
- Total depletion: -16 Energy
- Ends mission at **64/100 Energy** (Healthy, but declining)

### Energy Restoration (Refinement)

Between missions, pilots can **refine Soulstone Shards** to restore Core energy:

| Shard Tier | Energy Restored | Taint Cost | Refinement Time |
|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **T1 Shard** | +5 Energy | +1 Taint | 1 day |
| **T2 Fragment** | +15 Energy | +2 Taint | 2 days |
| **T3 Crystal** | +40 Energy | +5 Taint | 5 days |
| **T4 Core Replacement** | +100 Energy (new Core) | +10 Taint | 2 weeks (full ritual) |

**The Horror of Refinement:**
1. Take the Shard (contains soul fragment/echo)
2. Place it in the refinement chamber (faction-specific equipment)
3. **Crush the crystal** (mechanical press, ritual hammer, etc.)
4. Fragments liquefy into **soul essence** (glowing viscous fluid)
5. Essence is **injected/poured into the Core** (feeds the trapped soul)
6. Core soul **screams** as it absorbs the fragment (audible through crystal)
7. New faces appear in the Core's facets (consumed souls visible)

## Soulstone Acquisition & Rarity

### Mission Rewards (Primary Source)

| Mission Type | T1 Shards | T2 Fragments | T3 Crystals |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Standard Combat** | 1-2 | 0 | 0 |
| **Hard Combat** | 3-5 | 1 | 0 |
| **Boss Battle** | 5-8 | 2-3 | 1 |
| **Failed Mission** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Anomalous Event** | 1d6 | 1d3 | 1d2-1 (variable) |

### Special Campaign Events

**High-Yield Opportunities:**
- **"Soul Harvest" Mission:** 10+ T1 Shards (rare event, high Taint risk)
- **"Void Rift Stabilization":** Guaranteed T3 Crystal (extremely dangerous)
- **"Casket Graveyard Discovery":** 5-8 T2 Fragments (scavenge old battlefield)
- **"Abomination Core Extraction":** 1 T3 Crystal + 5 T1 Shards (boss-level enemy)

### Settlement Trading

**The Exchange (Merchant Faction):**
- **T1 Shards:** 20-30 Credits each (common stock)
- **T2 Fragments:** 60-100 Credits each (limited stock)
- **T3 Crystals:** 200-400 Credits each (rare, high demand)
- **T4 Cores:** 1,000+ Credits (special order, requires soul-binding contract)

**Black Market:**
- Prices 30-50% higher (no questions asked)
- Questionable provenance (stolen? involuntary binding?)
- Risk of Taint-corrupted Shards (damaged souls, unstable energy)

---

## Taint Corruption System

### What Is Taint?

**Taint** represents **Void corruption** accumulated through Soulstone refinement:
- Each time you feed fragments to the Core, Void energy seeps in
- Taint accumulates in both the **Soulstone** and the **Casket systems**
- High Taint = instability, unpredictability, risk of catastrophic failure

### Taint Accumulation

| Source | Taint Gained |
|--------|--------------|
| Refine T1 Shard | +1 Taint |
| Refine T2 Fragment | +2 Taint |
| Refine T3 Crystal | +5 Taint |
| Replace T4 Core | +10 Taint (one-time surge) |
| Field Emergency Recharge (success) | +2 Taint |
| Field Emergency Recharge (overload) | +5 Taint |
| Void Rift proximity | +1 Taint per turn exposed |

### Taint Threshold Effects

| Total Taint | Status | Mechanical Effect | Narrative |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **0-5** | Stable | None | Core soul is intact, mostly coherent |
| **6-10** | Unstable | -1 to all Pilot checks | Core soul is confused (hears multiple voices) |
| **11-15** | Fragmenting | -2 to Pilot checks, +1 Heat per turn | Core soul is screaming (dozens of merged fragments) |
| **16-20** | Corrupted | -3 to Pilot checks, random Thread Snaps | Core soul is chimera (hundreds of voices arguing) |
| **21+** | Void-Touched | Roll on Corruption Event table each mission | Core soul is losing coherence, Void influence growing |

### Taint Reduction (Between Missions)

| Method | Taint Reduced | Cost | Requirements |
|--------|---------------|------|--------------|
| **Church Prayer Ritual** | -2 Taint | 20 Credits, 1 week downtime | Access to consecrated chapel |
| **Dwarven Runic Purification** | -3 Taint | 40 Credits, 2 weeks downtime | Forge-Guild access, skilled runesmith |
| **Elven Root Cleansing** | -4 Taint | 0 Credits, 1 month downtime | Sacred grove access, must be outdoors |
| **Ossuarium Soul Replacement** | -10 Taint | 100 Credits, new Core required | Total Core swap (loses all current energy) |

---

## Void Corruption Events (Taint 21+)

When a Casket reaches **Taint 21 or higher**, roll **1d6 at the start of each mission**:

| Roll | Event | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| **1-2** | **The Whispers** | Core soul begs for more fragments. Pilot must pass **Grit DC 12** or suffer -1 SP this mission. |
| **3-4** | **Thread Rebellion** | Neural threads spasm uncontrollably. **Random equipment malfunctions** (GM chooses 1 weapon/system disabled for 1d3 turns). |
| **5** | **Soul Fragmentation** | Core soul splits into arguing voices. **Disadvantage on all attacks** this mission (conflicting commands). |
| **6** | **Void Breach** | Core soul attempts escape. **CRITICAL EVENT:** See below. |

### Void Breach (The Nightmare Scenario)

**What Happens:**
1. The Core soul, now a tortured chimera of consumed fragments, **takes control of the Casket**
2. The living pilot is still strapped inside, **but cannot control the machine**
3. Neural threads transmit overwhelming pain (all threads feel "on fire")
4. The Casket acts independently for **1d6 turns**

**Casket Behavior (Roll 1d6 each turn):**
- **1-2:** Attacks nearest target (friend or foe, randomly determined)
- **3-4:** Moves erratically (3d6 hexes in random direction, ignores terrain)
- **5:** Stands still, screaming (radio transmits Core soul's agony, all allies within 6 hexes suffer -1 to attacks)
- **6:** Attempts self-destruction (overload Soulstone Core, explosion in 2 turns)

**Pilot's Options During Breach:**
- **Regain Control:** Grit check **DC 18** each turn (regain control on success)
- **Emergency Shutdown:** Sever all neural threads manually (lose control permanently this mission, requires field repair)
- **Pray:** If Church pilot, can attempt **Prayer DC 15** to calm the Core (Church-specific)
- **Wait It Out:** Do nothing, hope the breach ends before catastrophe

**If Not Regained Within 6 Turns:**
- Soulstone Core **overloads and explodes**
- Casket takes **20 damage** (likely destroyed)
- All units within **3 hexes** take **8 damage** (friendly fire)
- Core is **permanently destroyed** (must replace entire Core, 1,000+ Credits)

## Core Burnout (End of Lifespan)

### The Degradation Cycle

Soulstone Cores do not last forever. After **500 total Energy cycled** (approximately 20-50 missions), the Core begins **terminal degradation**:

**Symptoms of Dying Core:**
- Energy restoration becomes **less efficient** (-20% per refinement)
- Taint accumulates **faster** (+1 extra Taint per refinement, regardless of Shard tier)
- Core soul becomes **nonresponsive** (no more screaming, just eerie silence)
- Crystal shows **visible cracks** (physical degradation, glowing fractures)
- Faces in the crystal **blur together** (chimera is losing coherence)

**Timeline:**
- **450-480 Energy:** First symptoms appear (efficiency drops)
- **481-495 Energy:** Accelerating decay (Taint surges, cracks spread)
- **496-500 Energy:** Final hours (Core pulses erratically, imminent failure)
- **500 Energy (Total):** **Core Burnout Event**

### Final Burnout Event

**What Happens:**
1. Core drops to **0 Energy permanently** (cannot be recharged)
2. Soulstone crystal **shatters** (explosion of purple-green light)
3. Core soul is **released/erased** (permanent death, no afterlife, consciousness annihilated)
4. Casket loses all power (immediate shutdown, even mid-mission)
5. Pilot must be extracted immediately (cannot survive long inside unpowered casket)

**Salvage from Burned Core:**
- Shattered fragments can be **ground into 5-10 T1 Shards** (grim recycling)
- **The Irony:** The soul that consumed hundreds of fragments is now **fragmented itself**
- Some factions consider this **poetic justice** (Ossuarium)
- Others find it **unbearably cruel** (Elves, Church moderates)

**Replacement Cost:**
- **New T4 Core:** 1,000-1,500 Credits (requires fresh soul-binding)
- **Refurbished Core:** 600-800 Credits (scavenged from destroyed casket, questionable quality)
- **Black Market Core:** 400-600 Credits (stolen, involuntary binding, high Taint risk)

---

## Emergency Field Recharge (Mid-Mission Mechanic)

### Desperate Measure

**Once per mission**, a pilot can perform an **Emergency Recharge**:
- Requires **1 full turn** (no movement, no attacks, vulnerable)
- Pilot must have **at least 1 Shard in inventory**
- Shard is crushed **inside the casket** (pilot does this manually, brutal process)

**Procedure:**
1. Pilot retrieves Shard from storage pouch (strapped inside casket)
2. Places Shard against Soulstone Core socket (reach behind, awkward angle)
3. **Manually crushes the Shard** (hammer, rock, casket's own hand)
4. Soul essence sprays directly onto Core (unrefined, chaotic)
5. Core absorbs it immediately (screams audibly through radio)

**Risk: Roll 1d6**

| Roll | Result | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1-3** | **Success** | Restore Energy as normal, gain Taint as normal |
| **4-5** | **Partial Overload** | Restore Energy, **+2x Taint** (double corruption) |
| **6** | **Critical Overload** | Restore Energy, **+3x Taint**, **immediate Thread Snap** (random thread severs) |

**Narrative:**
- Crystal fragments pierce pilot's hands (cutting through gloves)
- Blood mixes with soul essence (contaminated refinement)
- Core soul **screams so loudly** other units hear it through closed caskets
- Pilot's neural threads burn (agony transmitted from Core overload)
- Other players can **roleplay reactions** (horror, pity, disgust, encouragement)

## Faction Perspectives on Soulstone Use

| Faction | Moral Stance | Justification |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Church of Absolution** | Sacred Necessity | "The souls we consume have been consecrated. Their suffering purifies the Core. This is mercy, not cruelty." |
| **Dwarven Forge-Guilds** | Pragmatic Engineering | "Efficient use of resources. The fragments were already dead. No waste. No sentiment." |
| **The Ossuarium** | Ruthless Efficiency | "Souls are fuel. We've always been clear about this. Stop pretending it's anything else." |
| **Elven Verdant Covenant** | Reluctant Abomination | "This is wrong. Unnatural. Against the cycle. But we do it anyway, because we must survive. We are damned." |
| **The Exchange** | Economic Commodity | "Soulstones are inventory. Cores are assets. Refinement is resource management. Morality is irrelevant." |
| **Nomad Collective** | Survival Pragmatism | "We don't think about it. If we thought about it, we'd go mad. Just crush the Shard and keep moving." |
| **Wyrd Conclave** | Reality Manipulation | "The souls are already fragmenting reality. We simply accelerate the process. Art demands sacrifice." |
| **Vestige Bloodlines** | Evolutionary Fuel | "The chimera souls evolve with us. They're part of our mutation. This is symbiosis, not slavery." |
| **Emergent Syndicate** | Collective Consciousness | "Individual souls are obsolete. We merge them into hive nodes. They become part of something greater." |
| **Crucible Packs** | Explosive Worship | "Souls burn beautifully. If they're going to die anyway, let them die gloriously." |

## Designer Notes

**For 3D Printing:**
- Soulstone Core = **separate printable piece** (20-30mm crystal)
- **Translucent resin recommended** (purple/green glow effect)
- **Optional:** Sculpt tiny **distorted face** inside crystal (visible when backlit)
- **Socket on casket back** = standardized peg (magnet optional for easy swapping)
- **Faction variants** = different Core shapes (Church cross, Dwarf polyhedron, Ossuarium skull, etc.)

**Key Visual Element:**
When players look at a Casket's Soulstone Core, they should see:
1. The **glow** (pulsing purple/green light)
2. The **face(s)** (distorted screaming expressions in crystal facets)
3. The **cracks** (if Core is dying/high Taint)
4. The **faction shaping** (cross, runes, skull, etc.)

**The Horror Should Be Tangible:**
This isn't an abstract "mana crystal" or generic power source. This is a **screaming human soul trapped in a rock**, being **fed fragments of other souls** to keep it alive, slowly **degrading into a chimera monstrosity**.

Make it glow. Make it scream. Make it wrong.

Because that's what it is.
