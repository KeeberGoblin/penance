# Neural Thread Control System: The Puppet Strings

> *"Ten strings. Ten fingers. Pull the right one, and the machine dances. Pull wrong, and you die."*
> — Pilot Morrow, Nomad Collective

## What Are Neural Threads?

**Neural Threads** are bio-mechanical interfaces that connect a living pilot's nervous system to a Casket's control mechanisms. They are the **only way** to pilot a Casket—no alternative control systems exist.

They are **literal puppet strings**, drilled through the pilot's fingertips into bone, transmitting bioelectric signals that make a 15-foot war machine move.

## Physical Design

### The Threads Themselves

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Material** | Bio-conductive synthetic nerve fiber (pre-Sundering tech) |
| **Diameter** | 1-2mm (thinner than a pencil lead) |
| **Length** | Variable (routes from pilot's fingers to casket joints, 3-6 feet) |
| **Color** | Translucent silver-white (glows faintly during use) |
| **Durability** | Fragile (combat damage can sever threads easily) |
| **Lifespan** | Indefinite if undamaged, but degraded threads must be replaced surgically |

### Installation Points

Each pilot has **10 neural threads** installed:
- **5 threads per hand** (one per finger: thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky)
- Threads pierce through the **fingertip** (between nail and first joint)
- Drilled into the **distal phalanx bone** (fingertip bone)
- Secured with bio-adhesive and nerve-bonding gel
- **Cannot be removed without surgery** (permanent installation)

**Visual Appearance:**
- From outside: Thin wire emerging from fingertip (where fingerprint would be)
- From inside casket: Wires route through casket interior to control mechanisms
- When active: Threads pulse with faint bioelectric glow (silver-white shimmer)
- When damaged: Thread goes limp, frayed end sparks purple (Void energy discharge)

## Installation Procedure

### The Neural Threading Ritual (Faction-Specific)

**Church of Absolution:**
- **Duration:** 4-6 hours (includes prayer rituals)
- **Anesthetic:** Minimal (suffering is part of penance)
- **Method:** Hand-drilled with consecrated surgical tools
- **Priest's Blessing:** "Through pain, we find clarity. Through threads, we find purpose."
- **Post-Installation:** 2 weeks recovery, daily prayer to reduce phantom pain

**Dwarven Forge-Guilds:**
- **Duration:** 6-8 hours (precision engineering)
- **Anesthetic:** Full (unconscious throughout)
- **Method:** Laser-guided drill, runic thread anchors
- **Engineer's Note:** "Thread placement accuracy: 99.7%. Acceptable tolerances."
- **Post-Installation:** 3 weeks recovery, daily calibration exercises

**The Ossuarium:**
- **Duration:** 2-3 hours (rushed, industrial)
- **Anesthetic:** Partial (conscious but numbed)
- **Method:** Pneumatic drill, mass-produced threads
- **Technician's Warning:** "Hold still. If you flinch, you lose the finger."
- **Post-Installation:** 1 week recovery, high failure rate (10-15% require reinstallation)

**Elven Verdant Covenant:**
- **Duration:** 8-12 hours (ritual bonding)
- **Anesthetic:** Herbal trance (awake, pain-dulled)
- **Method:** Living vine threads grafted to nerves
- **Archdruid's Lament:** "We bind you to the machine. Forgive us."
- **Post-Installation:** 4 weeks recovery, threads "grow" into bone naturally

### Common Installation Steps

1. **Preparation:**
   - Pilot's hands are sterilized, immobilized
   - Fingers are individually clamped (prevents movement during drilling)
   - Neural mapping scan (identifies nerve clusters)

2. **Drilling:**
   - Drill pierces through fingertip (between nail and bone)
   - Hole diameter: 2-3mm (slightly larger than thread)
   - Depth: 5-10mm into distal phalanx bone
   - **Pain level:** Excruciating (even with anesthetic)

3. **Thread Insertion:**
   - Thread is fed through drilled hole
   - Bio-adhesive applied (bonds thread to bone)
   - Nerve-bonding gel injected (fuses thread to nerve endings)
   - Thread emerges from fingertip, extends toward casket joints

4. **Calibration:**
   - Pilot moves each finger individually
   - Technician observes casket's response (does limb move correctly?)
   - Fine-tuning adjustments (tighten/loosen thread tension)
   - Final test: Full range of motion exercises

5. **Sealing:**
   - Fingertip wound is sealed with synthetic skin
   - Thread exit point reinforced with metal ring (prevents tearing)
   - Pilot's hands are bandaged (cannot use hands normally for 1-2 weeks)

## How Neural Threads Work

### The Puppet Control Mechanism

**Basic Principle:**
- Pilot moves finger = bioelectric signal travels through thread
- Signal reaches casket joint = hydraulic actuator engages
- Casket limb mirrors the finger motion at larger scale

**Example:**
- Pilot **curls index finger** (right hand) → Right arm **bends at elbow**
- Pilot **extends middle finger** (left hand) → Left leg **straightens at knee**
- Pilot **wiggles thumb** (right hand) → Right hand **grips weapon**

**Thread-to-Function Mapping** (Standard Configuration):

| Finger | Right Hand Thread | Left Hand Thread |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Thumb** | Right hand grip/release | Left hand grip/release |
| **Index** | Right arm bend/extend | Left arm bend/extend |
| **Middle** | Right leg step/lift | Left leg step/lift |
| **Ring** | Right shoulder rotate | Left shoulder rotate |
| **Pinky** | Head/torso rotation (right) | Head/torso rotation (left) |

**Complex Movements:**
- Walking: Alternate middle fingers (left-right rhythm)
- Aiming: Index fingers (adjust arm angles)
- Firing: Thumbs (squeeze trigger)
- Dodging: Ring + Pinky (torso twist + shoulder rotation)

**Muscle Memory:**
- First 10-20 hours of piloting: Clumsy, confusing (wrong finger = wrong limb)
- After 50+ hours: Instinctive (pilot no longer thinks about which finger to move)
- After 200+ hours: Subconscious (pilot's fingers twitch before conscious thought)

### Bioelectric Feedback (Pain and Sensation)

**The Threads Transmit in Both Directions:**
- **Pilot → Casket:** Finger movement → Limb motion
- **Casket → Pilot:** Impact/damage → Phantom pain

**Feedback Types:**

| Casket Event | Pilot Sensation |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Casket takes damage** | Sharp pain in corresponding finger (thread transmits impact) |
| **Casket overheats** | Burning sensation in all fingers (threads feel "hot") |
| **Thread Snap** | Excruciating nerve shock (feels like finger being ripped off) |
| **Casket destroyed** | All threads discharge simultaneously (pilot blacks out from pain) |

**Why This Matters:**
- Pilots **feel the battle** viscerally (not detached button-pushing)
- Damage to the casket **hurts the pilot** (creates emotional investment)
- Thread Snaps are **traumatic** (psychological and physical scars)

## Thread Snap: The Nightmare

### What Happens When a Thread Severs

**Causes:**
- Combat damage to casket (limb destroyed, armor breached near thread routing)
- Overheating (threads melt/fray from excess bioelectric discharge)
- Taint corruption (Void energy degrades thread material)
- Emergency disconnect (pilot manually severs thread to prevent feedback overload)

**Immediate Effects:**
1. **Pilot:**
   - Excruciating nerve shock (DC 15 Grit check or lose 1 turn to pain)
   - Phantom sensation: "feels like finger was amputated"
   - Thread stump sparks purple (Void energy discharge)
   - Blood seeps from fingertip (thread tore through flesh/bone)

2. **Casket:**
   - Corresponding function **disabled** (cannot move that limb/joint)
   - Casket lurches/stumbles (sudden loss of control)
   - Error alarms (audio/visual warning in pilot's visor)

**Long-Term Effects:**
- **Temporary:** Thread can be **field-repaired** (1d6 turns, requires ally with Repair skill)
- **Permanent:** If thread is **completely destroyed**, requires surgical reinstallation (1 week downtime, 50 Credits)
- **Scarring:** Repeated Thread Snaps cause nerve damage (permanent -1 to pilot checks per 3 snaps)

### Field Repair (Emergency Fix)

**Requirements:**
- Ally with **Repair skill** (or pilot themselves if not in combat)
- **1 full turn** (vulnerable, cannot attack/move)
- **DC 12 Repair check** (failure = thread unfixable until settlement)

**Procedure:**
1. Locate severed thread end (inside casket, may require opening access panel)
2. Strip damaged section (cut away frayed/melted portion)
3. Splice thread to backup neural line (jury-rigged connection)
4. Seal with bio-adhesive (temporary bond, not as strong as original)
5. Test connection (pilot wiggles finger, casket responds?)

**Success:**
- Thread is **functional but fragile** (-1 to all checks using that thread)
- Will fail again if casket takes **5+ damage** in one hit
- Must be **properly repaired at settlement** (full surgical replacement)

## Thread Configurations (Faction Variants)

While the **10-thread standard** is universal, factions customize the **routing and aesthetics**:

### Church of Absolution: The Penitent Threads

**Customization:**
- Threads are **wrapped in blessed silk** (white/gold fabric)
- Installation includes **prayer beads** at each finger joint (click when moving)
- Thread routing forms **cross patterns** inside casket (visible when lid opens)

**Philosophy:**
- "Each thread is a chain of penance. Each movement is a prayer. Suffering sanctifies control."

### Dwarven Forge-Guilds: The Runic Threads

**Customization:**
- Threads are **etched with micro-runes** (enhance signal strength)
- Installation includes **runic anchors** in bone (prevents thread slippage)
- Thread routing is **geometrically optimized** (shortest path, minimal tangling)

**Philosophy:**
- "Precision engineering. Every millimeter matters. No wasted motion, no wasted material."

### The Ossuarium: The Bone Threads

**Customization:**
- Threads are **wrapped in bone fiber** (harvested from corpses)
- Installation includes **soul-binding glyphs** on fingertips (links threads to Soulstone)
- Thread routing forms **skeletal patterns** inside casket (mimics nervous system)

**Philosophy:**
- "The dead guide the living. The threads are tendons. The casket is a body. Control is biological."

### Elven Verdant Covenant: The Living Threads

**Customization:**
- Threads are **living vines** grafted to pilot's nerves (grows naturally)
- Installation includes **root anchors** in bone (threads "plant" themselves)
- Thread routing **sprouts leaves** inside casket (photosynthetic, reduces Heat)

**Philosophy:**
- "Nature and machine, merged. The threads live. We do not control the casket—we grow with it."

### The Exchange: The Standard Threads

**Customization:**
- Threads are **mass-produced** (no customization, generic installation)
- Installation includes **serial number tags** on each thread (inventory tracking)
- Thread routing follows **universal diagram** (interchangeable between caskets)

**Philosophy:**
- "Standardization ensures resale value. Custom threads reduce compatibility. This is business."

## Psychological Impact of Neural Threading

### The Bonding Process

**First Week:**
- Pilots experience **severe phantom sensations** (feels like fingers are 15 feet long)
- Dreams of being trapped, stretched, pulled apart
- Some pilots report hearing the **Soulstone soul's screaming** through the threads

**First Month:**
- Phantom sensations fade, replaced by **casket awareness** (pilot "feels" casket's position)
- Muscle memory begins forming (correct finger-to-limb mapping)
- Social isolation (cannot shake hands, hold objects normally due to thread sensitivity)

**After 6+ Months:**
- Threads feel **natural** (pilot forgets they're there)
- Casket becomes **extension of body** (pilot thinks "raise arm," finger moves automatically)
- Some pilots cannot distinguish **where their body ends and casket begins**

### The Disconnection Trauma

**What Happens When Threads Are Removed:**
- Pilot feels **amputated** (brain expects casket limbs, they're gone)
- Phantom limb syndrome (feels 15 feet tall, reaches for objects too far away)
- Depression, dissociation, identity crisis

**Common Symptoms:**
- "I'm too small. Everything is too close."
- "My hands don't work. I can't make them move right."
- "I miss the casket. I feel safe inside. Out here, I'm vulnerable."

**Recovery:**
- Most pilots **never fully recover** (permanent psychological dependence)
- Church offers **spiritual counseling** (reframe trauma as penance)
- Dwarves offer **prosthetic caskets** (small exoskeletons to ease transition)
- Many pilots **refuse to leave caskets** (live inside permanently)

## Thread Maintenance

### Daily Care (Pilot Responsibility)

**Morning Routine:**
1. Inspect threads (check for fraying, discoloration)
2. Clean fingertip exit points (remove dried blood, dead skin)
3. Apply nerve-bonding gel (keeps threads flexible)
4. Calibration exercises (wiggle each finger, confirm casket response)

**Post-Mission Routine:**
1. Thread stress test (apply tension, check for weak points)
2. Replace damaged sections (minor repairs, trim frayed ends)
3. Soak hands in regenerative solution (reduces nerve inflammation)
4. Report thread condition to ground crew (flag threads needing replacement)

### Settlement Overhaul (Every 10 Missions)

**Professional Thread Maintenance:**
- **Cost:** 20-30 Credits (per thread)
- **Duration:** 1 day (anesthetic, surgical replacement)
- **Procedure:**
  1. Remove old thread (surgical extraction)
  2. Clean installation channel (remove scar tissue)
  3. Install new thread (fresh bio-conductive fiber)
  4. Recalibrate (test all 10 threads for responsiveness)

**Neglect Consequences:**
- Degraded threads = -1 to -3 penalty on all pilot checks
- High Thread Snap risk (50% chance per mission if unmaintained)
- Permanent nerve damage (irreversible after 20+ missions without maintenance)

## Combat Scenarios: Thread-Based Tactics

### Losing Threads Mid-Battle

**1 Thread Snap:**
- **Minor inconvenience** (adapt, use other fingers to compensate)
- Example: Right thumb snaps (can't grip weapon) → Drop weapon, use melee limb instead

**3 Thread Snaps:**
- **Moderate disability** (one limb mostly non-functional)
- Example: Right index + middle + ring snap → Right arm and leg disabled → Fight one-handed

**5+ Thread Snaps:**
- **Critical failure** (casket barely controllable)
- Must retreat or risk total shutdown

**All 10 Threads Snap:**
- **Complete paralysis** (casket immobile, pilot helpless)
- Immediate extraction required (allies must rescue pilot from battlefield)

### Thread-Based Abilities (Optional Rules)

**Precision Control (Advanced Pilots):**
- Spend 1 SP, make **DC 15 Pilot check**
- On success: **+2 to attack roll** (perfect thread coordination)
- On failure: Thread Snap (random thread severs from overuse)

**Overcharge Threads (Desperate Measure):**
- Spend 3 SP, force all threads to **maximum bioelectric output**
- Effect: **+3 damage** on next attack, **Advantage on attack roll**
- Cost: Take **1d6 damage** (nerve overload), **+2 Heat**

**Emergency Disconnect:**
- Free action (can be done mid-turn)
- Sever 1 thread to **prevent feedback damage**
- Example: Casket is about to explode → Disconnect all threads → Survive explosion (no feedback pain)

## Designer Notes

**For 3D Printing:**
- Neural threads = **optional detail** (thin rods/wires from pilot hands to casket joints)
- If sculpting pilot inside casket:
  - Show **10 threads emerging from fingers** (visible in hands)
  - Route threads through casket interior (can use thin wire for actual model)
  - Thread exit points on casket limbs (small socket detail)
- **Faction variants** can customize thread appearance (silk wrapping, runes, bone fiber, vines)

**Key Visual Element:**
When looking at a Casket with open lid/visible interior:
1. Pilot's **hands visible** (arms crossed, fingers splayed)
2. **10 threads emerging** from fingertips (thin silver-white wires)
3. Threads **route through casket** (complex web of control lines)
4. **Thread attachment points** on limb joints (where strings connect to actuators)

**The Horror Should Be Anatomical:**
This isn't wireless control or button-pressing. This is **biological puppetry**. The pilot's nervous system is **physically wired** into the machine. Their fingers are **pierced**, their nerves are **hijacked**, and every impact **hurts them**.

Make it visceral. Make it invasive. Make it permanent.

Because that's what it is.
