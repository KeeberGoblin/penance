## The Central Question

**"Is this an alternate reality to our world? Why do fantasy creatures exist alongside Nikolas Theslar, a name that sounds distinctly human and modern?"**

**Short Answer**: Yes. Penance takes place in an **alternate Earth** where the magical and mundane coexisted for millennia before Theslar's catastrophic experiment tore reality apart.

## The True Cosmology: Three Intertwined Worlds

### The Material World (Our Reality)

**What It Was**: An Earth nearly identical to ours, but with one critical difference - magic existed, hidden in the margins.

**Timeline Divergence Point**: ~200,000 BCE

- Early humans encountered **ley lines** - natural channels of geomagnetic energy
- Some individuals could perceive and manipulate these energies (early mages)
- Non-human species evolved in parallel, shaped by proximity to ley line convergences
- Over millennia, a **dual civilization** emerged: mundane human society (visible) and arcane society (hidden)

**The Old World (Pre-Sundering)**:
- Surface appearance: Mid-20th century civilization (1950s-1970s equivalent technology)
- Hidden reality: Mages, elves, dwarves, and other species coexisted in secret enclaves
- Technology and magic were separate - **until Nikolas Theslar**

### Technology Level (Pre-Sundering)

The Old World's technology level was approximately **1950s-1970s equivalent**:

**What Existed**:
- Analog computers (mechanical calculators, punch card systems)
- Radio communications (vacuum tubes, transistor radios)
- Nuclear reactors (early fission power, experimental)
- Diesel engines, steam locomotives (mature technology)
- Mechanical engineering (advanced precision machining)
- Basic rocketry (experimental, no orbital satellites)

**What Did NOT Exist**:
- Internet or digital networks
- Orbital satellites or GPS
- Microprocessors or integrated circuits
- Personal computers or smartphones
- Advanced materials (carbon fiber, kevlar, etc.)

**Why This Matters**:
Dr. Theslar had access to **atomic physics knowledge** (explaining nuclear reactor references) and **analog computing machines** (mechanical mainframes using punch cards and vacuum tubes). His work with ley lines paralleled real-world atomic research of the 1940s-60s.

**Post-Sundering Regression**:
437 years later (Year 437), survivors have regressed to **1800s-1850s Victorian-era technology**:
- Steam power (relearned from salvaged books)
- Mechanical engineering (basic, lost precision machining knowledge)
- Metallurgy (iron/steel forging, lost advanced alloys)
- NO electronics (vacuum tube technology lost)
- NO radio (all radio infrastructure destroyed by EMP)

The current world is a steampunk-level civilization built on the ruins of a mid-20th-century atomic age.

### The Feywild (The Dream Layer)

**What It Is**: A parallel dimension overlapping the Material World, existing "sideways" in reality.

**Nature**:
- Not a separate planet, but a reflection of the Material World through the lens of emotion, myth, and dream-logic
- Time flows inconsistently (minutes here = years there, or vice versa)
- Geography mirrors the Material World but distorted (a forest might be a single massive tree, a city might be a living organism)
- Native species: Fae, spirits, and entities born from collective unconscious

**Relationship to Material World**:
- **Before the Sundering**: Feywild and Material were separated by a stable dimensional membrane
- Fae could cross over through natural portals (stone circles, ancient forests, crossroads at midnight)
- Crossings were rare, controlled, and required specific conditions
- Most humans never encountered the Fae; those who did chalked it up to madness or folklore

**The Fae's Perspective**:
The Fae existed in the Feywild for eons, aware of the Material World but largely indifferent to it. When Theslar activated The Theslar Engine, it didn't just tear open the Void - it **shattered the dimensional barriers between all three layers of reality**.

Suddenly, the Feywild was bleeding into the Material World. The Fae saw this as **opportunity** - a chance to expand their domain and influence. They adapted instantly because they've always lived between states of existence.

---

### The Void (The Anti-Creation)

**What It Is**: Not a dimension, but the **absence of dimension**. The space between realities where causality doesn't exist.

**Nature**:
- Pure chaos and unformed potential
- No physics, no time, no logic
- Hostile to structured existence (like matter is hostile to antimatter)
- Home to entities that should not exist - **Abominations**

**Abominations**:
- Not "creatures" in the traditional sense - they're failed attempts at existence
- When Void energy bleeds into the Material World, it tries to take shape
- Without conscious minds to shape it, Void energy becomes wrong - limbs in incorrect numbers, geometries that shouldn't be, sounds that cause bleeding
- Each Abomination is unique because chaos cannot repeat itself

**The Void's "Intent"** (if it can be said to have one):
The Void doesn't want to consume reality - it wants to **merge** with it. It's entropy made sentient, seeking equilibrium. When the Material World and Void merge completely, reality collapses into formless potential. The Engine is the wound that's slowly bleeding both worlds into each other.

## The Species: Why Fantasy Creatures Exist

### Species Demographics Overview

Before the Theslar Event, humanity was not one species—it was **seven distinct subspecies/variants** of *Homo sapiens*, each adapted to extreme environments or dimensional exposure over 50,000+ years. What fantasy calls "dwarves" and "elves" are actually **evolutionary divergences** shaped by volcanic caverns, ancient forests, and isolated ecosystems. Atlanteans represent the oldest divergence—proto-humans transformed by 50,000 years of Feywild exile.

**Total Surviving Population (Year 437):** ~12.45 million
**Pre-Sundering Global Population:** ~1.8 billion (not including Atlantis, which was in Feywild exile)
**Atlantean Population:** ~47,000 (returned Year 412 from dimensional exile)
**Casualties from Theslar Event:** 99.3% mortality

---

### 1. Humans (Homo sapiens sapiens)

**Origin**: Natural evolution, identical to our Earth. Remained in temperate surface environments with no extreme environmental pressures.

**Physical Characteristics**:
- **Height**: 5'4" - 6'2" (160-188 cm)
- **Skin**: Full melanin range (pale to dark brown)
- **Hair**: All colors, grows continuously
- **Eyes**: Brown, blue, green, hazel
- **Build**: Medium frame, generalist physiology
- **Lifespan**: 60-80 years (pre-Sundering)

**Magic Sensitivity**: Rare. Approximately 1 in 10,000 humans can perceive ley lines naturally. Of those, 1 in 100 can manipulate them (mages).

**Population**:
- **Pre-Sundering**: ~1.8 billion (dominant species)
- **Year 437**: 8.2 million (68.3% of survivors)
- **Primary Factions**: Church, Ossuarium, Exchange, Nomads

**Cultural Development**: Humans dominated the Old World numerically but were unaware of the full extent of non-human species. Most believed elves and dwarves were myths. **Nikolas Theslar himself was human and had no idea his experiment would affect non-human civilizations.**

**Post-Sundering**: The dominant species numerically. No biological differences between Church/Ossuarium/Exchange members - "Human" is a cultural identity, not a separate species.

---

### 2. Elves (Homo Sylvanus)

**Origin**: ~50,000 BCE - Divergent human evolution in ancient Amazon Basin and Congo rainforests. Exposed to concentrated **ley line energy** for 50,000+ years (geomantic radiation). Developed **symbiotic relationship with fungal networks** (mycelial integration). Ley magic shaped cellular structure (chlorophyll analogs developed).

**Physical Characteristics**:

**Skin**:
- **Chlorophyll-infused epidermis** (pale green to olive-green tint)
- Semi-photosynthetic (absorb ~15% of energy needs from sunlight)
- Bark-like texture on extremities (elbows, knees, spine)
- **Lichen growth on shoulders/back** (symbiotic, not parasitic)
- Wounds weep **green sap** (plant-based coagulant)

**Hair**:
- **Living plant fibers** (cellulose-based, not keratin)
- Colors: Moss green, bark brown, autumn red (seasonal changes)
- Hair can photosynthesize (chloroplasts in strands)
- Can be "pruned" but regrows like vines
- Some elves cultivate **flowering hair** (blossoms in spring)

**Eyes**:
- **Compound iris structure** (like insect eyes - thousands of micro-lenses)
- See into infrared spectrum (detect heat signatures)
- Eye colors: Amber, gold, deep green (plant-based pigments)
- Vertical slit pupils (enhanced night vision)

**Build**:
- **Height**: 5'8" - 6'6" (173-198 cm) - tall and willowy
- **Weight**: 110-150 lbs (hollow bones like birds)
- Elongated limbs (arboreal adaptation)
- Fingers 20% longer than baseline human (grasping branches)
- Prehensile toes (can grip with feet)

**Adaptations**:
- **Mycorrhizal nervous system** (fungal tendrils in bloodstream connect to forest networks)
- **Photosynthetic supplementation** (reduce food needs by 15%)
- **Regeneration** (regrow fingers/toes over weeks via root grafting)
- **Poison immunity** (liver processes plant toxins)
- **Seasonal dormancy** (enter hibernation in winter)

**Casket Integration**:
- Elves undergo **"Root-Grafting"** - legs replaced with living vine prosthetics
- Vines plug directly into Casket hydraulics (plant-machine hybrid interface)
- Can photosynthesize energy for Casket systems (backup power)

**Population**:
- **Pre-Sundering**: ~200,000 globally
- **Year 437**: 480,000 (4% of survivors)
- **Primary Faction**: Verdant Covenant

**Lifespan**: 300-400 years (ley line exposure + photosynthetic supplementation)

**Cultural Development**:
- Isolationist even before the Sundering
- Built hidden forest cities (Roothold, The Grove of First Light)
- Viewed humans as "young, loud, and careless"
- View baseline humans as "severed from the roots"
- Mourning rituals for trees (they feel forest die-offs)
- Druidic practices pre-date the Sundering by 10,000 years

**How They Stayed Hidden**: Elven enclaves existed in remote forests and mountains. To humans, they were legends, folklore, or "lost tribes." The few humans who stumbled upon elven settlements were either welcomed (rarely) or turned away with memory-wiping glamours (more commonly).

**Post-Sundering Status**: Vulnerable. Elven fertility dropped catastrophically after the Cataclysm (Void energy disrupted their symbiotic biology). **Current Threat**: 40% of ancestral forests destroyed. Mycorrhizal networks collapsing. Elves who lose grove connection suffer **"The Withering"** (slow death). Remaining elves formed the Verdant Covenant, desperately trying to heal the "wounded world" before their species dies out.

### 3. Dwarves (Homo Subterra)

**Origin**: ~40,000 BCE - Divergent human evolution adapted to subterranean life. Descended into volcanic cavern systems in the Alps and Caucasus Mountains. Lived 500-2,000 meters underground for 45,000+ years. Adapted to geothermal heat, low oxygen, darkness, and volcanic gases.

**Physical Characteristics**:

**Skin**:
- **Ash-gray to charcoal-black** (melanin loss + volcanic ash exposure)
- Thick, heat-resistant dermis (3x human epidermis thickness)
- Naturally sooty appearance from constant volcanic particulates
- Facial **tattoos using crushed minerals** (cultural tradition to distinguish clans)
- Tattoos glow faintly in forge-light (phosphorescent compounds)

**Hair**:
- **Completely hairless** (head, face, body)
- Hair follicles atrophied over 40,000 years
- Eyebrows/eyelashes vestigial or absent
- Cultural practice: Runic scalp tattoos replace hair as identity marker
- **Beardlessness is NOT a flaw—it's ancestral**

**Eyes**:
- **Reflective tapetum lucidum** (like cats - light-gathering)
- Eye colors: Amber, copper, deep red (hemoglobin-rich retinas)
- Nictitating membrane (third eyelid for volcanic ash protection)
- Sensitive to bright light (sunglasses required on surface)

**Build**:
- **Height**: 4'2" - 4'10" (127-147 cm) - **stocky, not "short and stout"**
- **Weight**: 180-250 lbs (denser bones from high-gravity cavern life)
- **Bone density**: 40% denser than baseline human (silicate-calcium matrix)
- Barrel-chested (increased lung capacity for thin air)
- Short limbs, long torso (heat conservation)

**Physiology**:
- Dense bones (adapted to high-pressure underground environments)
- Enhanced low-light vision (tapetum lucidum)
- **Sulfur toxin immunity** (liver processes volcanic gases)
- **Thermal regulation** (sweat glands excrete metallic salts, not water)
- **Seismic sensitivity** (can detect tremors through footfalls)
- **Enhanced grip strength** (climbing vertical mine shafts)
- **Slow metabolism** (can survive on 800 calories/day)
- Resistance to radiation (evolutionary necessity in deep mines)
- Lifespan: 90-120 years (slow aging in stable environment)
- **Not magically inclined** - dwarven nervous systems are less sensitive to ley lines, making them naturally resistant to Taint

**Population**:
- **Pre-Sundering**: ~1.5 million globally
- **Year 437**: 1.2 million (10% of survivors)
- **Primary Faction**: Forge-Guilds, Crucible Pacts

**Cultural Identity**:
- Facial tattoos indicate clan, rank, and craft specialization
- Runesmith tattoos are most intricate (master craftsmen)
- Smooth skin considered "unmarked" (childlike/unproven)

**Cultural Development**:
- Built vast underground cities (Ironhearth, Stoneroot, The Deeps)
- Master craftsmen, metallurgists, and engineers
- Traded with surface humans through intermediaries (The Exchange acted as go-betweens)

**How They Stayed Hidden**: Dwarven cities were entirely underground. Most humans knew of dwarves as "miners in the deep mountains" but assumed they were just reclusive human clans. Dwarven-forged goods were sold under human brand names.

**Why They Survived**: When the Sundering hit, dwarves were already underground, shielded from the initial Pulse. Their cities survived largely intact, making them one of the few factions to retain pre-Cataclysm technology and knowledge.

**Post-Sundering**: Thriving (relatively). Dwarves became the industrial powerhouses of the new world, selling weapons, Caskets, and runecraft to all factions. They're pragmatic war-profiteers - they'll sell to anyone who can pay.

### 4. Goblinoids (Homo Infernus) - Crucible Pacts

**Origin**: ~35,000 BCE - Descended into Icelandic volcanic rifts and Mediterranean sulfur caves. Exposed to extreme geothermal radiation and toxic gases for 33,000+ years. Developed extreme heat resistance and accelerated metabolism.

**Physical Characteristics**:
- **Skin**: Ash-gray to soot-black. **Ritual burn scars** cover 30-60% of body (cultural rite of passage—badges of honor)
- **Hair**: White-gray to silver (thermal bleaching). Coarse texture. Often braided with obsidian beads
- **Eyes**: Yellow to orange (sulfur-pigmented retinas). Reflective in firelight
- **Height**: 3'10" - 4'8" (117-142 cm) - small but wiry
- **Weight**: 85-120 lbs. Fast-twitch muscle fibers
- **Teeth**: Filed teeth (cultural practice - sharpened canines)

**Physiology**:
- **Pyrokinetic thermoregulation** (body temp 102-105°F baseline)
- **Sulfur toxin immunity** (breathe volcanic gases safely)
- **Accelerated healing** (wounds close in 1/3 normal time)
- **Pain suppression** (endorphin overproduction from burn scarring)
- Hyperactive metabolism (eat 3,000+ calories/day)
- Lifespan: 35-50 years (fast metabolism = early burnout)

**Population**:
- **Pre-Sundering**: ~350,000 globally
- **Year 437**: 220,000 (1.8% of survivors)
- **Primary Faction**: Crucible Pacts

**Cultural Identity**: Burn scars are **badges of honor** (more scars = higher status). Fire-worship pre-dates written history. View baseline humans as "untempered" (weak, soft). Goblinoids live fast, die young - 38 years old is ancient by their standards.

**Post-Sundering**: Integrated into Crucible Pacts alongside some Dwarves. Their heat resistance and volcanic adaptation make them natural forge-workers and fire-cultists.

### 5. Desert-Adapted Nomads (Homo Aquilus)

**Origin**: ~30,000 BCE - Isolated in Sahara, Arabian, and Australian deserts. 29,000 years of extreme heat and water scarcity adaptation.

**Physical Characteristics**:
- **Skin**: Deep bronze to copper-brown (extreme melanin concentration). **No sweat glands** (conserve water). Reflective sheen (silicon-based outer layer deflects UV)
- **Hair**: Black to dark brown. Coarse texture. **Dreadlocks common** (natural formation)
- **Eyes**: **Double eyelids** (nictitating membrane for sandstorms). Brown to amber
- **Height**: 5'6" - 6'2" (168-188 cm)
- **Weight**: 130-170 lbs (lean, hollow bones)

**Physiology**:
- **Water conservation** (kidneys extract 99% moisture from waste)
- **Temperature extremes** (survive 120°F days, 40°F nights)
- **Endurance running** (can run 50+ miles/day)
- **Sandstorm breathing** (nasal filters block particulates)
- Long limbs (heat dissipation)
- Lifespan: 50-70 years (harsh environment accelerates aging)

**Population**:
- **Pre-Sundering**: ~3.2 million globally
- **Year 437**: 1.8 million (15% of survivors)
- **Primary Faction**: Nomad Collective

**Cultural Identity**: Survival-focused pragmatism. Trade networks span continents. "Home is where you survive." Genetic compatibility with baseline humans is 95%—nearly identical.

**Post-Sundering**: Thriving through adaptation. Desert-adapted physiology made them natural survivors of the post-apocalyptic wasteland.

---

### 6. Frostborn (Homo Polaris) - **CRITICALLY ENDANGERED**

**Origin**: ~25,000 BCE - Isolated in Arctic Circle (Siberia, Greenland, Northern Canada). 25,000 years of extreme cold adaptation.

**Physical Characteristics**:
- **Skin**: Alabaster white (complete melanin loss). Thick subcutaneous fat layer (4x baseline). Semi-translucent (veins visible). Blue undertone
- **Hair**: White, platinum blonde, or ice-blue. Dense (50% more follicles)
- **Eyes**: Pale blue, gray, or white (minimal pigmentation). Reflective tapetum lucidum
- **Height**: 5'0" - 5'8" (152-173 cm) - compact build
- **Weight**: 160-220 lbs (dense fat reserves)

**Physiology**:
- **Extreme cold resistance** (survive -60°F indefinitely)
- **Brown fat thermogenesis** (generate heat without shivering)
- **Hibernation capability** (can enter torpor for weeks)
- **Snow-blindness immunity** (UV-resistant retinas)
- Short limbs (heat conservation)
- Barrel-chested (increased lung capacity)
- Lifespan: 70-100 years

**Population**:
- **Pre-Sundering**: ~2.5 million
- **Year 437**: ~50,000 (0.4% of survivors - **98% CASUALTIES**)
- **Status**: Scattered (nearly extinct)

**Why Near-Extinct**: Theslar Event epicenter was North Pole (their homeland). Arctic survivors fled south (heat intolerance). Genetic bottleneck (inbreeding depression). Low birth rates in temperate climates.

**Prognosis**: Extinction within 200 years without intervention. Some survivors integrated into other factions or bound to Iron Doctrine trains.

**Post-Sundering**: One of maybe 50,000 left alive. People stare at their albino skin like they're ghosts. Most survivors remember the Arctic before it became Ground Zero.

### 7. Atlanteans (Homo Atlanticus) - **THE PHASING CITY**

**Origin**: ~62,000 BCE - Earth's first great civilization. Proto-human evolutionary divergence that existed simultaneously in Material Plane and Feywild. Have been **cyclically phasing between dimensions for 62,000 years** due to leyline surges. Not mythological—they are **evolved proto-humans transformed by repeated dimensional transitions**.

**Physical Characteristics**:

**Skin**:
- **Iridescent teal to silver-blue** (Feywild transformation - bioluminescent undertones)
- Slightly translucent (leyline veins visible glowing beneath surface)
- Shifts color based on light angle (oil-on-water effect)
- Semi-permeable to Feywild energy (can absorb ambient magic)

**Hair**:
- **White to deep ocean blue** (thermal bleaching from dimensional exposure)
- Flows as if underwater even in still air (perpetual low-gravity Feywild effect)
- Some individuals have bioluminescent strands (glow faintly in darkness)
- Texture like silk-fine kelp

**Eyes**:
- **Solid color, no visible pupils** (teal, aquamarine, silver)
- Faint inner glow (leyline-infused optic nerves)
- See in infrared and leyline spectra (detect energy flows invisible to others)
- Non-blinking (nictitating membrane instead of eyelids)

**Build**:
- **Height**: 6'2" - 6'8" (189-203 cm) - elongated by Feywild low gravity
- **Weight**: 140-180 lbs (hollow bones, reduced bone density)
- Slender, graceful, elongated limbs (arboreal Fae influence)
- Fingers 15% longer than baseline human (adapted for leyline manipulation)

**Blood**:
- **Luminescent silver-blue** (leyline-infused hemoglobin)
- Glows faintly when exposed to air (oxidizes into bioluminescence)
- Coagulates instantly (crystallizes into leyline-charged scabs)

**Physiology**:
- **Lifespan: 120-180 years** (Fey-enhanced but still mortal - NOT immortal)
- **Chronological vs Subjective Age**: Feywild time dilation means centuries there = millennia on Earth
- **Near-sterile** (1 in 1,000 conceptions succeed - Feywild exposure damaged fertility)
- **Feywild dependency** (require 6+ hours/week Feywild immersion or suffer physical degradation)
- **Phase shifting** (can partially phase into Feywild, becoming incorporeal for 30-60 seconds)
- **Leyline sight** (see leylines as glowing threads connecting locations)
- **Timeless perception** (experience time non-linearly, occasional precognition)
- **Reality editing** (minor Feywild reality-bending within 10 feet - water flows uphill, light bends)
- **Dimensional anchor** (cannot be forcibly teleported, banished, or displaced)
- High Architect Thalassar: Chronologically 62,000 years old, subjectively ~1,200 years lived

**Population**:
- **Pre-Exile (~62,000 BCE)**: ~2 million
- **Returned (Year 412)**: ~47,000 (sterility reduced population 98% during exile)
- **Year 437**: ~47,100 (near-zero population growth)
- **Prognosis**: Extinct in 3,000-5,000 years without intervention
- **Territory**: Eye of the Sahara (Richat Structure, Mauritania) - 12-fold leyline nexus

**Cultural Identity**:
- **Language**: Ancient proto-language predating all modern human tongues (sounds like water flowing, wind chimes, harmonic resonance)
- **Architecture**: Crystalline bio-luminescent cities existing simultaneously in Material + Feywild
- **Philosophy**: "We are the Between People. Neither here nor there, human nor Fae, past nor present."
- **Temporal psychosis**: 8% suffer permanent temporal disorientation (lost in non-linear time)
- **Cosmic loneliness**: Everyone they knew outside Atlantis died 50,000 years ago
- **Cultural stagnation**: Functionally immortal = no generational change, frozen civilization

**The Phasing Cycle**:
Atlantis hasn't been exiled once. It has been **phasing between Material Plane and Feywild for 62,000 years**, pulled back and forth by leyline surges. Documented returns:
- **First Founding** (~62,000-50,000 BCE): 12,000 years in Material
- **Second Return** (~10,000-8,000 BCE): 2,000 years (recorded as "Great Flood" myths)
- **Third Return** (~600-300 BCE): 300 years (Plato documented them in *Timaeus* & *Critias*)
- **Current Return** (Year 412-Present): 25 years and counting

**Draconid Secret**: This is the **seventh** return, not the fourth. Three earlier cycles lost to history. Pattern: return → brief stability → conflict → phasing back to Feywild. Atlanteans don't remember previous returns due to temporal psychosis from dimensional transitions.

**Why They Keep Returning**:
They don't choose. Leyline surges force dimensional shifts. The Theslar Event supercharged dormant leylines, reopening the Eye of the Sahara nexus in Year 412. They returned because the gateway pulled them through, not because they wanted to come home.

**Post-Sundering**:
- **Status**: Neutral isolationists. Claim only Eye of the Sahara + 100km exclusion zone
- **No alliances**: Refuse diplomatic relations with all factions
- **Self-sufficient**: Feywild conjuration + leyline farming (no need for trade)
- **Technology**: 50,000+ years ahead of post-Sundering factions (leyline engineering, dimensional anchors, memory crystals)
- **Tragedy**: They age and die like any human (120-180 years), but civilization persists across millennia. Each return, everyone they knew is dead. They're perpetual strangers in their own homeland.
- **Population Crisis**: Terminal sterility (1 in 1,000 births) + cultural stagnation = slow extinction
- **GM Secret**: Draconid archives reveal this is the **seventh** return. Pattern always repeats: return → brief hope → conflict → phasing. High Architect Thalassar knows this. He's lived through all seven cycles. He expects an eighth.

**Unique Threat**: Not hostile, but dangerously indifferent. View post-Sundering factions as "children playing with matches." Will not intervene to save humanity from itself. If Eye of the Sahara leyline nexus fails, Atlantis phases back to Feywild permanently—taking all their knowledge with them.

### 8. The Ossuarium (Undead)

**Origin**: Not a species, but a **post-Sundering phenomenon**.

**How Undeath Emerged**:
- The Void's intrusion weakened the barrier between life and death
- Necromantic magic, previously theoretical, became practical
- First undead rose spontaneously in Year 3 (corpses near Void rifts reanimating due to chaotic energy)
- **Bonelord Karath** (originally human necromancer) perfected controlled undeath by Year 10

**Types of Undead in The Ossuarium**:
1. **Revenants** (Intact corpses, semi-intelligent) - Former humans bound by contracts
2. **Skeletons** (No flesh, tireless) - Labor force
3. **Spectres** (Incorporeal, sentient) - Mages who died with unfinished business
4. **Liches** (Voluntary transformation) - Necromancers who preserved their minds

**Necromantic Pact**: The Ossuarium operates on **soul economics**. Thresh discovered that souls can be bound, traded, and stored in Soulstones. The undead faction is built on contracts: "Give me your soul when you die, and I'll give you what you want now."

**Post-Sundering**: Growing. Every year, more people sign Thresh's contracts out of desperation. The Ossuarium is patient - they don't need to conquer the world. They just need to wait for everyone else to die, then collect.

---

### The Wyrd Conclave (Fae)

**Origin**: Native to the Feywild, not the Material World.

**Physiology**: Variable. Fae don't have fixed forms.
- **Appearance**: Fae can look like anything - beautiful humanoids, talking animals, living shadows, impossible geometries
- **True Form**: Debatable if they even have one. Fae are more **concept** than creature.
- **Lifespan**: Functionally immortal (they exist outside linear time)

**How They Think**: Fae do not experience reality the way mortals do.
- **Logic**: Operates on dream-logic and narrative rules. A promise is more binding than physics.
- **Morality**: Alien. Fae aren't evil, but they value interesting outcomes over suffering/happiness.
- **Deals**: Everything is transactional. Nothing is free. Every bargain has a price, and the price is always literal (ask for "a hand" and they'll take yours).

**Post-Sundering**: Thriving. The Feywild merging with the Material World is the best thing that ever happened to the Fae. They've expanded into reality, establishing Shimmerlands (zones of reality-optional overlap). They're the only faction genuinely happy about the Cataclysm.

**Mockingbird's Identity**: A high-ranking Fae emissary. She wears dozens of masks, each one representing a different "aspect" of herself. Players who deal with her never know which aspect they're talking to - the Trickster, the Diplomat, the Predator, or the Merchant.

---

### Vestige Bloodlines (Post-Human Chimeras)

**Origin**: Humans mutated by Void exposure in the first 50 years post-Sundering.

**How They Formed**:
- Early survivors in Void-heavy regions (near Siberia, along ley line ruptures) were exposed to raw chaotic energy
- Void energy doesn't just corrupt - it **rewrites biology randomly**
- First generation: Minor mutations (enhanced senses, claws, fur patches)
- Second generation: Major mutations (human-animal hybrids - wolf-men, bear-folk, insectoid humanoids)
- Third generation: Increasingly unstable (risk of becoming full Abominations)

**Genetics**: Blighted reproduce sexually, but offspring are unpredictable. Two wolf-Blighted parents might have a raven-Blighted child. The mutations are **chaotic**, not hereditary.

**Cultural Tragedy**: The Blighted didn't choose this. They're victims. But every other faction treats them as monsters. They're hunted, exiled, and blamed for the Cataclysm even though they suffered worst from it.

**Post-Sundering**: Dying out. Each generation is less stable than the last. They know they're going extinct within 200 years unless they find a way to stabilize their genome. This desperation makes them dangerous - they have nothing left to lose.

---

### Emergent Syndicate (Arthropod Collective)

**Origin**: Human researchers at Siberia, ground zero, during the Sundering.

**How They Transformed**:
- The Siberian Research Station had bio-labs containing genetic samples (arthropods, arachnids, insects)
- When the Engine activated, Void energy fused the researchers with these samples
- **Not random mutation** - this was metamorphosis. They became post-human, multi-limbed, chitinous, insectoid

**Physiology**:
- Exoskeleton (armored carapace, molts every 5 years)
- Multiple limbs (4-8 arms, 2-6 legs depending on individual)
- Compound eyes (360° vision)
- Hive-mind communication (pheromones + telepathic link)
- **Still human minds**, but collective-oriented. Individuality exists but is secondary to hive efficiency.

**Psychology**: They remember being human. They remember their names, families, lives before. But those memories feel distant, irrelevant. They've evolved beyond humanity. They don't mourn what they lost - they embrace what they've become.

**Post-Sundering**: Expanding slowly. The Ascendancy reproduces through **conversion** - they capture humans, expose them to controlled Void energy + arthropod genetic material, and transform them. Volunteers are rare. Forced conversions are common. This makes them universally feared and hated.

## Nikolas Theslar: The Man Who Broke The World

### Biography (Pre-Sundering)

**Full Name**: Dr. Nikolas Theslar (human, born Year -43 Old Calendar)

**Background**:
- Prodigy engineer and theoretical mage
- Believed magic and technology could be unified
- Obsessed with the idea of "wireless power transmission" (inspired by Nikola Tesla's real-world experiments)
- Theorized that ley lines were planetary electromagnetic fields that could be harnessed

**The Theslar Engine Project**:
- Funded by a coalition of governments (human-only; non-human species were unaware of the project)
- Built in the Siberian Wastes at the convergence of 7 major ley lines
- Goal: Broadcast infinite clean energy wirelessly across the world
- **He genuinely believed he was saving humanity** - no more fossil fuels, no more war over resources, no more poverty

**Fatal Flaw**: Theslar didn't know about the Void. His instruments detected the dimensional membrane as "background noise." He assumed it was irrelevant. **He was wrong.**

### The Sundering (Year 0)

**What Happened**:
1. The Engine activated at full power
2. Ley lines began channeling energy as designed
3. The dimensional membrane **couldn't handle the strain** - it tore
4. Void energy flooded through the tear, mixing with ley line energy
5. The Engine became a permanent wound, unable to be shut down
6. Electromagnetic pulse destroyed all active technology within 1,000 miles
7. Magical shockwave killed or maddened every mage on the planet

**Theslar's Fate**:
- Did not die
- Became **fused with the Engine itself** (see Chronicle IX: "The Screaming Choir")
- His consciousness is trapped in the Engine's core, aware but unable to act
- He conducts the "Screaming Choir" - the voices of everyone who tried to shut down the Engine and failed
- Players who reach the Core will meet him

**Theslar's Final Words** (from recovered audio log):
> "It's singing. The world... it's singing. I can hear it all - every life, every thought, every possibility. I was right. I was *so close* to being right.
>
> But I missed something. There's... something else here. In the spaces between. It's looking at me.
>
> It's always been looking.
>
> Oh God. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I didn't—
>
> [Static. Screaming. The Pulse. Silence.]"

## The Reconciliation: Magic + Technology in the Old World

### How Magic Stayed Hidden

**Pre-Sundering Society** operated on a two-tiered system:

**Mundane Layer** (visible to 99.9% of humans):
- Mid-20th century technology (trains, factories, radio, analog computers, nuclear power)
- No knowledge of non-human species
- Magic was folklore, superstition, and stage tricks
- Science was the dominant worldview

**Arcane Layer** (hidden):
- Mages, elves, dwarves, and other sensitives operated in secret societies
- **The Veil Accords** (signed ~1,200 years ago): Agreement between human mages and non-human species to remain hidden from mundane humanity
- Why? Fear of persecution. Humans outnumbered non-humans 1000:1. If humanity knew about magic and other species, it would mean war.
- Mages acted as intermediaries, translating non-human knowledge into "human inventions"

**Examples**:
- Dwarven metallurgy became "revolutionary new steel alloys" (credited to human inventors)
- Elven herbalism became "pharmaceutical breakthroughs" (human doctors took credit)
- Fae-inspired art became "eccentric human genius" (artists were often unknowingly channeling Feywild influence)

**Why the Veil Worked**: Humans are good at ignoring what they don't want to see. Mages used memory-wiping magic, misinformation, and strategic "debunking" to keep non-humans hidden.

**When the Sundering Hit**: The Veil collapsed. Suddenly, humans couldn't ignore the elves, dwarves, and undead rising around them. The secret was out. But by then, it didn't matter - civilization had collapsed.

## Why This Matters for Gameplay

### Player Questions Answered

**Q: "Is this Earth?"**
A: Yes. An alternate Earth where magic existed in hiding. The Sundering revealed what was always there.

**Q: "Why do fantasy creatures exist?"**
A: Evolutionary divergence (elves, dwarves), dimensional natives (fae), and post-apocalyptic mutations (Blighted, Ascendancy).

**Q: "Why does Nikolas Theslar have a modern-sounding name?"**
A: Because he's human, from a human society that developed parallel to ours (late 19th/early 20th century equivalent).

**Q: "Can the world be restored to 'normal'?"**
A: Debatable. The Void can be sealed, but magic, non-humans, and Soulstones won't disappear. The world has fundamentally changed. Players must decide: restore what was lost, or adapt to what it's become?

## The Secret Truth (GM Knowledge Only)

### The Draconids Were Right

**Hidden Lore** (revealed only if players complete the Draconid questline):

The Cataclysm has happened **three times total** (including the current one):
1. **First Ending (50,000 BCE)**: Flood. Cause unknown. Survivors: primitive humans, nascent elves.
2. **Second Ending (10,000 BCE)**: Fire. Volcanic superchains + ley line destabilization. Survivors: rebuilt civilizations.
3. **Third Ending (Year 0)**: Void. Theslar's Engine. Current state.

**The Pattern**: Every 20,000-40,000 years, a civilization reaches a technological/magical peak, discovers something it shouldn't, and triggers a cataclysm.

**The Fourth Ending**: If players fix The Engine and stabilize the world, civilization will rebuild. In 20,000 years, their descendants will make the same mistake.

**The Draconids' Role**: Record-keepers. They've seen this cycle three times. They're waiting to see if *this* cycle's survivors break the pattern or repeat it.

**Player Agency**: Do they:
- Break the cycle (find a permanent solution)?
- Repeat the cycle (stabilize, but ensure it happens again)?
- Embrace the cycle (accept that endings are necessary for new beginnings)?

## Conclusion: The World of Penance

**Penance is our world**, broken by hubris. The fantasy elements aren't alien - they were always here, hidden beneath the surface. The Sundering didn't create the impossible - it **revealed** it.

Nikolas Theslar wasn't a villain. He was a scientist trying to save the world who didn't know he was playing with forces beyond comprehension. He paid for it. Everyone paid for it.

And now, 437 years later, the survivors pilot iron tombs powered by the very energy that destroyed their world, fighting over the scraps of a civilization that thought it could master the unknowable.

**The central tragedy**: The Cataclysm was preventable. If Theslar had known about the Void. If the Veil Accords hadn't hidden non-human knowledge from humanity. If the Draconids had shared their warnings instead of hoarding them.

But hubris, secrecy, and fear ensured that no one had the full picture.

And the world paid the price.

*"We were always one mistake away from the abyss. Theslar just happened to be the one who made it."*
