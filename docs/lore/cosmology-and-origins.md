## The Central Question

**"Is this an alternate reality to our world? Why do fantasy creatures exist alongside Nikolas Theslar, a name that sounds distinctly human and modern?"**

**Short Answer**: Yes. Penance takes place in an **alternate Earth** where the magical and mundane coexisted for millennia before Theslar's catastrophic experiment tore reality apart.

## The True Cosmology: Three Intertwined Worlds

### The Material World (Our Reality)

**What It Was**: An Earth nearly identical to ours, but with one critical difference - magic existed, hidden in the margins.

**Timeline Divergence Point**: ~200,000 BCE

- Early humans encountered **ley lines** - natural channels of geomagnetic energy
- Some individuals could perceive and manipulate these energies (early mages)
- Non-human species evolved in parallel, shaped by proximity to ley line convergences
- Over millennia, a **dual civilization** emerged: mundane human society (visible) and arcane society (hidden)

**The Old World (Pre-Sundering)**:
- Surface appearance: Mid-20th century civilization (1950s-1970s equivalent technology)
- Hidden reality: Mages, elves, dwarves, and other species coexisted in secret enclaves
- Technology and magic were separate - **until Nikolas Theslar**

### Technology Level (Pre-Sundering)

The Old World's technology level was approximately **1950s-1970s equivalent**:

**What Existed**:
- Analog computers (mechanical calculators, punch card systems)
- Radio communications (vacuum tubes, transistor radios)
- Nuclear reactors (early fission power, experimental)
- Diesel engines, steam locomotives (mature technology)
- Mechanical engineering (advanced precision machining)
- Basic rocketry (experimental, no orbital satellites)

**What Did NOT Exist**:
- Internet or digital networks
- Orbital satellites or GPS
- Microprocessors or integrated circuits
- Personal computers or smartphones
- Advanced materials (carbon fiber, kevlar, etc.)

**Why This Matters**:
Dr. Theslar had access to **atomic physics knowledge** (explaining nuclear reactor references) and **analog computing machines** (mechanical mainframes using punch cards and vacuum tubes). His work with ley lines paralleled real-world atomic research of the 1940s-60s.

**Post-Sundering Regression**:
437 years later (Year 437), survivors have regressed to **1800s-1850s Victorian-era technology**:
- Steam power (relearned from salvaged books)
- Mechanical engineering (basic, lost precision machining knowledge)
- Metallurgy (iron/steel forging, lost advanced alloys)
- NO electronics (vacuum tube technology lost)
- NO radio (all radio infrastructure destroyed by EMP)

The current world is a steampunk-level civilization built on the ruins of a mid-20th-century atomic age.

### The Feywild (The Dream Layer)

**What It Is**: A parallel dimension overlapping the Material World, existing "sideways" in reality.

**Nature**:
- Not a separate planet, but a reflection of the Material World through the lens of emotion, myth, and dream-logic
- Time flows inconsistently (minutes here = years there, or vice versa)
- Geography mirrors the Material World but distorted (a forest might be a single massive tree, a city might be a living organism)
- Native species: Fae, spirits, and entities born from collective unconscious

**Relationship to Material World**:
- **Before the Sundering**: Feywild and Material were separated by a stable dimensional membrane
- Fae could cross over through natural portals (stone circles, ancient forests, crossroads at midnight)
- Crossings were rare, controlled, and required specific conditions
- Most humans never encountered the Fae; those who did chalked it up to madness or folklore

**The Fae's Perspective**:
The Fae existed in the Feywild for eons, aware of the Material World but largely indifferent to it. When Theslar activated The Theslar Engine, it didn't just tear open the Void - it **shattered the dimensional barriers between all three layers of reality**.

Suddenly, the Feywild was bleeding into the Material World. The Fae saw this as **opportunity** - a chance to expand their domain and influence. They adapted instantly because they've always lived between states of existence.

---

### The Void (The Anti-Creation)

**What It Is**: Not a dimension, but the **absence of dimension**. The space between realities where causality doesn't exist.

**Nature**:
- Pure chaos and unformed potential
- No physics, no time, no logic
- Hostile to structured existence (like matter is hostile to antimatter)
- Home to entities that should not exist - **Abominations**

**Abominations**:
- Not "creatures" in the traditional sense - they're failed attempts at existence
- When Void energy bleeds into the Material World, it tries to take shape
- Without conscious minds to shape it, Void energy becomes wrong - limbs in incorrect numbers, geometries that shouldn't be, sounds that cause bleeding
- Each Abomination is unique because chaos cannot repeat itself

**The Void's "Intent"** (if it can be said to have one):
The Void doesn't want to consume reality - it wants to **merge** with it. It's entropy made sentient, seeking equilibrium. When the Material World and Void merge completely, reality collapses into formless potential. The Engine is the wound that's slowly bleeding both worlds into each other.

## The Species: Why Fantasy Creatures Exist

### Humans

**Origin**: Natural evolution, identical to our Earth.

**Magic Sensitivity**: Rare. Approximately 1 in 10,000 humans can perceive ley lines naturally. Of those, 1 in 100 can manipulate them (mages).

**Cultural Development**: Humans dominated the Old World numerically but were unaware of the full extent of non-human species. Most believed elves and dwarves were myths. **Nikolas Theslar himself was human and had no idea his experiment would affect non-human civilizations.**

**Post-Sundering**: The dominant species in the Church of Absolution and the Penitent Kingdoms. They interpret the Cataclysm through a religious lens because their culture was heavily influenced by Abrahamic faiths.

---

### Elves (Homo Sylvanus)

**Origin**: Divergent human evolution, shaped by ley line exposure over 50,000+ years.

**Physiology**:
- Lifespan: 300-400 years (cellular regeneration enhanced by ambient ley line energy)
- Enhanced senses: See into infrared spectrum, hear subsonic frequencies
- **Symbiotic relationship with plant life**: Elven biology incorporated chlorophyll analogs (can supplement nutrition through sunlight, though they still eat)
- Not "magical" by nature, but their bodies are naturally attuned to ley line flows

**Cultural Development**:
- Isolationist even before the Sundering
- Built hidden forest cities (Roothold, The Grove of First Light)
- Viewed humans as "young, loud, and careless"
- Pre-Sundering, elves numbered only ~200,000 globally (compared to billions of humans)

**How They Stayed Hidden**: Elven enclaves existed in remote forests and mountains. To humans, they were legends, folklore, or "lost tribes." The few humans who stumbled upon elven settlements were either welcomed (rarely) or turned away with memory-wiping glamours (more commonly).

**Post-Sundering**: Nearly extinct. Elven fertility dropped catastrophically after the Cataclysm (Void energy disrupted their symbiotic biology). Remaining elves formed the Verdant Covenant, desperately trying to heal the "wounded world" before their species dies out.

---

### Dwarves (Homo Subterra)

**Origin**: Another divergent human evolution, adapted to subterranean life ~40,000 years ago.

**Physiology**:
- Stocky, dense bones (adapted to high-pressure underground environments)
- Enhanced low-light vision (tapetum lucidum like cats)
- Resistance to toxic gases and radiation (evolutionary necessity in deep mines)
- Lifespan: 150-200 years
- **Not magically inclined** - dwarven nervous systems are less sensitive to ley lines, making them naturally resistant to Taint

**Cultural Development**:
- Built vast underground cities (Ironhearth, Stoneroot, The Deeps)
- Master craftsmen, metallurgists, and engineers
- Pre-Sundering, dwarves numbered ~1.5 million globally
- Traded with surface humans through intermediaries (The Exchange acted as go-betweens)

**How They Stayed Hidden**: Dwarven cities were entirely underground. Most humans knew of dwarves as "miners in the deep mountains" but assumed they were just reclusive human clans. Dwarven-forged goods were sold under human brand names.

**Why They Survived**: When the Sundering hit, dwarves were already underground, shielded from the initial Pulse. Their cities survived largely intact, making them one of the few factions to retain pre-Cataclysm technology and knowledge.

**Post-Sundering**: Thriving (relatively). Dwarves became the industrial powerhouses of the new world, selling weapons, Caskets, and runecraft to all factions. They're pragmatic war-profiteers - they'll sell to anyone who can pay.

### The Ossuarium (Undead)

**Origin**: Not a species, but a **post-Sundering phenomenon**.

**How Undeath Emerged**:
- The Void's intrusion weakened the barrier between life and death
- Necromantic magic, previously theoretical, became practical
- First undead rose spontaneously in Year 3 (corpses near Void rifts reanimating due to chaotic energy)
- **Bonelord Thresh** (originally human necromancer) perfected controlled undeath by Year 10

**Types of Undead in The Ossuarium**:
1. **Revenants** (Intact corpses, semi-intelligent) - Former humans bound by contracts
2. **Skeletons** (No flesh, tireless) - Labor force
3. **Spectres** (Incorporeal, sentient) - Mages who died with unfinished business
4. **Liches** (Voluntary transformation) - Necromancers who preserved their minds

**Necromantic Pact**: The Ossuarium operates on **soul economics**. Thresh discovered that souls can be bound, traded, and stored in Soulstones. The undead faction is built on contracts: "Give me your soul when you die, and I'll give you what you want now."

**Post-Sundering**: Growing. Every year, more people sign Thresh's contracts out of desperation. The Ossuarium is patient - they don't need to conquer the world. They just need to wait for everyone else to die, then collect.

### The Wyrd Conclave (Fae)

**Origin**: Native to the Feywild, not the Material World.

**Physiology**: Variable. Fae don't have fixed forms.
- **Appearance**: Fae can look like anything - beautiful humanoids, talking animals, living shadows, impossible geometries
- **True Form**: Debatable if they even have one. Fae are more **concept** than creature.
- **Lifespan**: Functionally immortal (they exist outside linear time)

**How They Think**: Fae do not experience reality the way mortals do.
- **Logic**: Operates on dream-logic and narrative rules. A promise is more binding than physics.
- **Morality**: Alien. Fae aren't evil, but they value interesting outcomes over suffering/happiness.
- **Deals**: Everything is transactional. Nothing is free. Every bargain has a price, and the price is always literal (ask for "a hand" and they'll take yours).

**Post-Sundering**: Thriving. The Feywild merging with the Material World is the best thing that ever happened to the Fae. They've expanded into reality, establishing Shimmerlands (zones of reality-optional overlap). They're the only faction genuinely happy about the Cataclysm.

**Mockingbird's Identity**: A high-ranking Fae emissary. She wears dozens of masks, each one representing a different "aspect" of herself. Players who deal with her never know which aspect they're talking to - the Trickster, the Diplomat, the Predator, or the Merchant.

### Vestige Bloodlines (Post-Human Chimeras)

**Origin**: Humans mutated by Void exposure in the first 50 years post-Sundering.

**How They Formed**:
- Early survivors in Void-heavy regions (near Sibaria, along ley line ruptures) were exposed to raw chaotic energy
- Void energy doesn't just corrupt - it **rewrites biology randomly**
- First generation: Minor mutations (enhanced senses, claws, fur patches)
- Second generation: Major mutations (human-animal hybrids - wolf-men, bear-folk, insectoid humanoids)
- Third generation: Increasingly unstable (risk of becoming full Abominations)

**Genetics**: Blighted reproduce sexually, but offspring are unpredictable. Two wolf-Blighted parents might have a raven-Blighted child. The mutations are **chaotic**, not hereditary.

**Cultural Tragedy**: The Blighted didn't choose this. They're victims. But every other faction treats them as monsters. They're hunted, exiled, and blamed for the Cataclysm even though they suffered worst from it.

**Post-Sundering**: Dying out. Each generation is less stable than the last. They know they're going extinct within 200 years unless they find a way to stabilize their genome. This desperation makes them dangerous - they have nothing left to lose.

---

### Emergent Syndicate (Arthropod Collective)

**Origin**: Human researchers at Sibaria, ground zero, during the Sundering.

**How They Transformed**:
- The Sibarian Research Station had bio-labs containing genetic samples (arthropods, arachnids, insects)
- When the Engine activated, Void energy fused the researchers with these samples
- **Not random mutation** - this was metamorphosis. They became post-human, multi-limbed, chitinous, insectoid

**Physiology**:
- Exoskeleton (armored carapace, molts every 5 years)
- Multiple limbs (4-8 arms, 2-6 legs depending on individual)
- Compound eyes (360° vision)
- Hive-mind communication (pheromones + telepathic link)
- **Still human minds**, but collective-oriented. Individuality exists but is secondary to hive efficiency.

**Psychology**: They remember being human. They remember their names, families, lives before. But those memories feel distant, irrelevant. They've evolved beyond humanity. They don't mourn what they lost - they embrace what they've become.

**Post-Sundering**: Expanding slowly. The Ascendancy reproduces through **conversion** - they capture humans, expose them to controlled Void energy + arthropod genetic material, and transform them. Volunteers are rare. Forced conversions are common. This makes them universally feared and hated.

## Nikolas Theslar: The Man Who Broke The World

### Biography (Pre-Sundering)

**Full Name**: Dr. Nikolas Theslar (human, born Year -43 Old Calendar)

**Background**:
- Prodigy engineer and theoretical mage
- Believed magic and technology could be unified
- Obsessed with the idea of "wireless power transmission" (inspired by Nikola Tesla's real-world experiments)
- Theorized that ley lines were planetary electromagnetic fields that could be harnessed

**The Theslar Engine Project**:
- Funded by a coalition of governments (human-only; non-human species were unaware of the project)
- Built in the Sibarian Wastes at the convergence of 7 major ley lines
- Goal: Broadcast infinite clean energy wirelessly across the world
- **He genuinely believed he was saving humanity** - no more fossil fuels, no more war over resources, no more poverty

**Fatal Flaw**: Theslar didn't know about the Void. His instruments detected the dimensional membrane as "background noise." He assumed it was irrelevant. **He was wrong.**

---

### The Sundering (Year 0)

**What Happened**:
1. The Engine activated at full power
2. Ley lines began channeling energy as designed
3. The dimensional membrane **couldn't handle the strain** - it tore
4. Void energy flooded through the tear, mixing with ley line energy
5. The Engine became a permanent wound, unable to be shut down
6. Electromagnetic pulse destroyed all active technology within 1,000 miles
7. Magical shockwave killed or maddened every mage on the planet

**Theslar's Fate**:
- Did not die
- Became **fused with the Engine itself** (see Chronicle IX: "The Screaming Choir")
- His consciousness is trapped in the Engine's core, aware but unable to act
- He conducts the "Screaming Choir" - the voices of everyone who tried to shut down the Engine and failed
- Players who reach the Core will meet him

**Theslar's Final Words** (from recovered audio log):
> "It's singing. The world... it's singing. I can hear it all - every life, every thought, every possibility. I was right. I was *so close* to being right.
>
> But I missed something. There's... something else here. In the spaces between. It's looking at me.
>
> It's always been looking.
>
> Oh God. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I didn't—
>
> [Static. Screaming. The Pulse. Silence.]"

## The Reconciliation: Magic + Technology in the Old World

### How Magic Stayed Hidden

**Pre-Sundering Society** operated on a two-tiered system:

**Mundane Layer** (visible to 99.9% of humans):
- Mid-20th century technology (trains, factories, radio, analog computers, nuclear power)
- No knowledge of non-human species
- Magic was folklore, superstition, and stage tricks
- Science was the dominant worldview

**Arcane Layer** (hidden):
- Mages, elves, dwarves, and other sensitives operated in secret societies
- **The Veil Accords** (signed ~1,200 years ago): Agreement between human mages and non-human species to remain hidden from mundane humanity
- Why? Fear of persecution. Humans outnumbered non-humans 1000:1. If humanity knew about magic and other species, it would mean war.
- Mages acted as intermediaries, translating non-human knowledge into "human inventions"

**Examples**:
- Dwarven metallurgy became "revolutionary new steel alloys" (credited to human inventors)
- Elven herbalism became "pharmaceutical breakthroughs" (human doctors took credit)
- Fae-inspired art became "eccentric human genius" (artists were often unknowingly channeling Feywild influence)

**Why the Veil Worked**: Humans are good at ignoring what they don't want to see. Mages used memory-wiping magic, misinformation, and strategic "debunking" to keep non-humans hidden.

**When the Sundering Hit**: The Veil collapsed. Suddenly, humans couldn't ignore the elves, dwarves, and undead rising around them. The secret was out. But by then, it didn't matter - civilization had collapsed.

## Why This Matters for Gameplay

### Player Questions Answered

**Q: "Is this Earth?"**
A: Yes. An alternate Earth where magic existed in hiding. The Sundering revealed what was always there.

**Q: "Why do fantasy creatures exist?"**
A: Evolutionary divergence (elves, dwarves), dimensional natives (fae), and post-apocalyptic mutations (Blighted, Ascendancy).

**Q: "Why does Nikolas Theslar have a modern-sounding name?"**
A: Because he's human, from a human society that developed parallel to ours (late 19th/early 20th century equivalent).

**Q: "Can the world be restored to 'normal'?"**
A: Debatable. The Void can be sealed, but magic, non-humans, and Soulstones won't disappear. The world has fundamentally changed. Players must decide: restore what was lost, or adapt to what it's become?

## The Secret Truth (GM Knowledge Only)

### The Draconids Were Right

**Hidden Lore** (revealed only if players complete the Draconid questline):

The Cataclysm has happened **three times total** (including the current one):
1. **First Ending (50,000 BCE)**: Flood. Cause unknown. Survivors: primitive humans, nascent elves.
2. **Second Ending (10,000 BCE)**: Fire. Volcanic superchains + ley line destabilization. Survivors: rebuilt civilizations.
3. **Third Ending (Year 0)**: Void. Theslar's Engine. Current state.

**The Pattern**: Every 20,000-40,000 years, a civilization reaches a technological/magical peak, discovers something it shouldn't, and triggers a cataclysm.

**The Fourth Ending**: If players fix The Engine and stabilize the world, civilization will rebuild. In 20,000 years, their descendants will make the same mistake.

**The Draconids' Role**: Record-keepers. They've seen this cycle three times. They're waiting to see if *this* cycle's survivors break the pattern or repeat it.

**Player Agency**: Do they:
- Break the cycle (find a permanent solution)?
- Repeat the cycle (stabilize, but ensure it happens again)?
- Embrace the cycle (accept that endings are necessary for new beginnings)?

---

## Conclusion: The World of Penance

**Penance is our world**, broken by hubris. The fantasy elements aren't alien - they were always here, hidden beneath the surface. The Sundering didn't create the impossible - it **revealed** it.

Nikolas Theslar wasn't a villain. He was a scientist trying to save the world who didn't know he was playing with forces beyond comprehension. He paid for it. Everyone paid for it.

And now, 437 years later, the survivors pilot iron tombs powered by the very energy that destroyed their world, fighting over the scraps of a civilization that thought it could master the unknowable.

**The central tragedy**: The Cataclysm was preventable. If Theslar had known about the Void. If the Veil Accords hadn't hidden non-human knowledge from humanity. If the Draconids had shared their warnings instead of hoarding them.

But hubris, secrecy, and fear ensured that no one had the full picture.

And the world paid the price.

*"We were always one mistake away from the abyss. Theslar just happened to be the one who made it."*
