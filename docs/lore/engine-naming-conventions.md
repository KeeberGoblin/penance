# The Many Names of the Apocalypse

**Player-Facing Name**: **The Engine** (universal, simple - use this in rules and gameplay)
**Full Name**: The Theslar Engine (T.E.) - for technical documentation
**Historical Term**: The Theslar Engine (pre-Sundering scientific jargon)

**Note for Players**: Throughout this game, when you see "The Engine," we're talking about the machine that ended the world in Year 0. Keep it simple—no need to track different names unless you're reading faction lore for immersion.

## Faction-Specific Names (For Flavor & Immersion)

Each faction interprets the cataclysm through their own cultural, religious, or philosophical framework. These names reveal how they understand what happened—and who they blame. **NPCs and flavor text use these names**, but players can just say "The Engine" and everyone knows what you mean.

### Church of Absolution
**"The Theslar Sin"**
- Religious framing: The Engine was humanity's ultimate hubris
- Nikolas Theslar committed the Original Sin of the new age
- The Sundering was divine punishment for attempting to play God
- Common phrases:
  - "Before the Sin" (pre-Year 0)
  - "The Day of Judgment" (the activation)
  - "Theslar's Penance" (the 437 years since)

**In Church Scripture**:
> "And Theslar, in his pride, reached beyond the veil. He sang the forbidden harmonies, and the world answered with screaming silence. His sin is our inheritance. Our penance is eternal."

---

### Dwarven Forge-Guilds
**"The Engine" or "Theslar's Folly"**
- Practical, engineering-focused language
- Less interested in blame, more in understanding mechanics
- View it as a catastrophic prototype failure
- Common phrases:
  - "The Folly" (shorthand)
  - "The Cascade Breach"
  - "The Failed Experiment"

**In Dwarven Records**:
> "Theslar's calculations were sound. His materials were not. An energy cascade of that magnitude requires containment we still cannot forge. He built the greatest machine ever conceived—and it killed the world."

---

### The Ossuarium
**"The Ledger's Opening"** or "The First Harvest"
- See it as the beginning of their power, not a disaster
- Bonelord Thresh opened The Ledger during the chaos
- The Engine created the conditions for soul-binding
- Common phrases:
  - "The Opening" (when Thresh founded the Ossuarium)
  - "The Great Reaping"
  - "The Soul Breach"

**In Ossuarium Chronicles**:
> "When Theslar tore the world, he opened a door. Thresh walked through it. What humanity calls disaster, we call genesis. The Engine did not end the world—it revealed its true nature: a ledger of debts unpaid."

---

### Elven Verdant Covenant
**"The Withering"** or "The Sundering Scream"
- Ecological catastrophe framing

- Less about Theslar, more about the wound itself
- Common phrases:
  - "The Scream" (the moment forests began dying)
  - "The Root-Death"
  - "The Void Wind"

**In Elven Oral Tradition**:
> "The roots heard it first. A note that should not be. The trees screamed as their souls were pulled from the earth. Theslar did not build a machine—he built a hunger. And it still feeds."

---

### The Wyrd Conclave (Fae)
**"The Unmaking"** or "The Wyrd Collapse"

  - "The Day Reality Forgot Itself"
  - "The Echo Event"

**In Wyrd Whispers**:
> "Theslar thought he built a machine. He did not. He found something that was always there, sleeping beneath perception. He woke it. The Theslar Engine is not an invention—it is a summoning."

---

### Nomadic Scrap-Takers
**"The Break"** or "Old Nik's Bomb"
- Colloquial, irreverent language

- Common phrases:
  - "The Break" (most common)
  - "The Big Crack"

  - "The Great Bankruptcy"

  - "The Change" (most common)
  - "The Awakening Flesh"
  - "The First Shift"

**In Bloodline Songs**:
> "Theslar cracked the world, and we crawled from the wound. His Engine broke the chains of form. Flesh became fluid. Bone became choice. We are not cursed—we are free."

---

## Cross-Cultural Terms

Some terms are used across multiple factions:

- **"Year 0"** - Universal historical marker (neutral, adopted by all record-keepers)
- **"The Sundering"** - Poetic term used by scholars and historians
- **"The Cascade Event"** - Scientific term (used by engineers, researchers)
- **"The Day the World Sang"** - Ironic phrase (references Theslar's final words: "It's singing")

---

## Theslar's Final Transmission

The last words heard from Dr. Nikolas Theslar before the world ended:

> **"Activation successful. Readings are... wrong. No, not wrong. Different. It's not generating power—it's amplifying something already there. Something vast. Oh god. It's singing. IT'S SINGING—"**
>
> [Signal lost. Year 0 begins.]

Every faction knows these words. Every faction interprets them differently.

---

## Historical Note

**For Players**: Just call it **"The Engine."** Simple, universal, no confusion.

**For Lore Nerds**: The artifact's full technical name is "The Theslar Engine" (T.E.), but no one in-world actually uses that sterile term. To call it by its proper name feels inadequate for something that killed 90% of humanity.

Everyone has their own word for the end of the world.

And The Engine is still out there. Somewhere. Still humming.

**Design Note**: This document allows NPCs, flavor text, and faction dialogue to use culturally appropriate names for the apocalypse. A Church zealot would never say "The Engine"—they'd say "The Theslar Sin." A dwarf engineer would say "The Folly." An elf would whisper "The Withering."

**Players don't need to memorize these.** Just say "The Engine" during gameplay and you're good. The faction names are for immersion when reading lore or hearing NPC dialogue.
