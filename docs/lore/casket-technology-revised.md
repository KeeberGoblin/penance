## What Is a Casket?

**Caskets** are humanity's most powerful—and most horrifying—technology. These war machines are the only equipment capable of fighting Abominations, controlling territory, and projecting power in the post-Sundering world.

But they are neither autonomous robots nor simple vehicles.

A Casket is a **hybrid system**:

1. **Living Pilot** (volunteer human, strapped inside the casket core)
2. **Bound Soul** (trapped in Soulstone crystal, provides power)
3. **Neural Thread Interface** (10 strings drilled into pilot's fingertips, puppet control)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Official Name** | Soulstone-Powered Neural Combat Chassis (SPNCC) |
| **Common Name** | Caskets ("coffins with legs") |
| **Size** | 12-15 feet tall, 800-2,400 lbs depending on class |
| **Power Source** | Soulstone Core (bound soul trapped in crystal battery) |
| **Control System** | Living pilot inside, 10 neural threads through fingertips |
| **Pilot Life Expectancy** | Variable (combat mortality, not soul degradation) |
| **Moral Status** | Heavily debated (necessary evil vs. abomination) |

## The Three-Layer Horror

### 1. The Living Pilot (The Operator)

**Who They Are:**
- Volunteers who undergo the Flesh Bargain ritual
- Strapped into the casket core with arms crossed (mummy position)
- Kneeling or seated (legs removed in some factions to save space)
- Conscious, awake, aware during all operations

**What They Experience:**
- **Vision:** Direct line-of-sight through a narrow **viewing slit** in the casket lid
  - No cameras, no sensors—just a thin gap inches from their face
  - Damage to the slit = instant blindness
  - Claustrophobic, vulnerable, visceral
- **Control:** Neural threads pierce through all 10 fingertips (drilled into fingerbeds/bones)
  - Move fingers = casket moves (literal puppet strings)
  - Feel every impact as phantom pain
  - Thread Snap = lost control of that limb
- **Restraints:** Straps, harnesses, bindings keep them secured inside
  - Cannot move more than a few inches
  - Cannot escape without assistance
  - Some pilots describe it as "being buried alive, but upright"
- **Breathing:** Normal air circulation (not submerged in fluid)
  - Can speak via radio (voice echoes inside casket)
  - Hear battle sounds directly (no audio dampening)

**The Flesh Bargain:**
- To fit inside the cramped casket interior, many pilots undergo **leg removal**
- Church: "The Shortening" (legs amputated at hip)
- Dwarves: "Compact Form" (all four limbs removed, runic stumps)
- Ossuarium: "Efficient Form" (ALL flesh removed except skull/spine)
- Elves: "Root-Grafting" (legs replaced with living vines)

### 2. The Bound Soul (The Battery)

**What It Is:**
- A **human soul** trapped inside the Soulstone Core (crystal mounted on casket's back)
- One primary consciousness (usually a recently deceased person)
- Bound via resonance chamber at moment of death
- Powers the casket's hydraulics, servos, and systems

**The Ethical Nightmare:**
- The pilot (living human) is NOT the soul in the Soulstone
- You are piloting a machine **powered by someone else's trapped consciousness**
- The soul is **aware, suffering, unable to escape**
- Most souls scream constantly (pilots learn to tune it out)

**Soul Degradation:**
- Unlike the living pilot, the **Soulstone soul** degrades over time
- 20-50 missions before the soul "burns out" (becomes inert)
- As energy depletes, the soul becomes **fragmented, incoherent**
- Final stages: whispers, pleas, then silence

### 3. The Neural Thread Interface (The Strings)

**Physical Design:**
- 10 bio-mechanical threads (5 per hand)
- Drilled/pierced through pilot's **fingertips into bone**
- Threads route from fingers through casket interior to limb actuators
- Literally puppet strings—pull the right one, casket moves

**How It Works:**
- Pilot moves fingers in specific patterns
- Neural threads transmit bioelectric signals to casket joints
- Casket mirrors the motion at larger scale
- Fine motor control = precise casket movements
- Damaged thread = lost control of that function

**Thread Snap:**
- Combat damage can sever neural threads
- Pilot feels **agonizing phantom pain** when thread snaps
- Lost function until repaired (field repairs difficult)
- Multiple snaps = casket becomes uncontrollable

**The Horror:**
- Threads cannot be removed without surgery
- Permanent nerve damage if installed incorrectly
- Some pilots describe "feeling the machine's weight" through the strings
- Others say they can "hear the Soulstone screaming through the threads"

## The Casket's Anatomy

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Soulstone Core** | Bound soul (power source). Mounted on back, glows purple/green. Contains distorted screaming face visible in crystal facets. |
| **Pilot Capsule** | Interior chamber where living pilot is strapped (chest-height in torso). Open lid design with viewing slit. |
| **Neural Threads (10)** | Bio-mechanical strings piercing pilot's fingertips. Puppet control system. |
| **Chassis** | Reinforced steel/titanium frame (800-2,400 lbs depending on class: Scout, Assault, Heavy, Support) |
| **Limbs** | Modular arms/legs with standardized attachment points (Gunpla-style O-ring/C-clip system). Faction-customizable. |
| **Viewing Slit** | Narrow gap in casket lid/face. Pilot's only visual access to battlefield. Vulnerable to damage. |
| **Restraint System** | Straps, harnesses, bindings securing pilot inside capsule. Prevents movement during combat impacts. |
| **Deck System** | Cards represent casket's structural integrity. 0 cards = casket destroyed, pilot may survive if extracted quickly. |

## Casket Weight Classes

Caskets are classified by **torso size and limb weight**. Each class has different core dimensions and attachment point sizes.

| Class | Torso Height | Weight | Role | Deck Size |
|-------|--------------|--------|------|-----------|
| **Scout** | 10-12 feet | 800-1,200 lbs | Reconnaissance, speed, hit-and-run | 30 cards |
| **Assault** | 12-14 feet | 1,200-1,800 lbs | Frontline combat, balanced offense/defense | 40 cards |
| **Heavy** | 14-16 feet | 1,800-2,400 lbs | Tank, area denial, siege warfare | 50 cards |
| **Support** | 11-13 feet | 900-1,400 lbs | Buffs, healing, logistics, command | 35 cards |

**Modular Limb System:**
- All casket classes use **standardized attachment points** (O-ring peg + C-clip socket)
- Players can **mix and match limbs** from different factions (scavenged parts, custom builds)
- Limbs come in different weights/styles:
  - **Light Limbs:** Fast, low armor, precision weapons
  - **Medium Limbs:** Balanced, general-purpose
  - **Heavy Limbs:** Slow, high armor, siege weapons

## Pre-Sundering Origins

**What Were Caskets Before Year 0?**
- **Industrial Exoskeletons** for construction, mining, disaster response
- NOT military equipment—purely civilian/industrial use
- Built by Titan Industries, Prometheus Corp, Atlas Engineering

**Why Caskets Survived the EMP:**
- Shielded fusion cells (radiation protection blocked EMP)
- Analog hydraulics (mechanical backups, not purely electronic)
- Bioelectric interface (neural control used organic signals)
- Result: Most primitive modern tech became most advanced post-Sundering tech

**The Irony:**
Construction equipment designed to lift steel beams became humanity's greatest weapons.

## Year 0, Day 6: The First Soul-Binding

**Dr. Marcus Thresher's Discovery:**
- Trapped in collapsing research facility after Sundering
- Surrounded by corpses, wearing failing exoskeleton
- Theory: If souls are bioelectric, maybe they can power machines
- **The Breakthrough:** Connected corpse's nervous system to exoskeleton's power interface
- It worked—dead colleague's soul began powering the machine

**The First Hybrid Casket:**
- Dr. Thresher (living pilot) inside the exoskeleton
- His wife Dr. Elena Thresher's soul (trapped in improvised Soulstone)
- He piloted, she powered the machine
- Both were suffering, both were trapped
- But they survived

> *"Elena... I'm sorry. But you're still here. In a way. I can feel you in the machine. You're angry. But you're here."*
> — Dr. Marcus Thresher, later Bonelord Thresh

## The Pilot Experience

**What Does It Feel Like to Pilot a Casket?**

From rare interviews with surviving pilots:

**Before Deployment:**
- Strapped into casket by ground crew (takes 10-15 minutes)
- Neural threads checked for connection integrity
- Soulstone Core inspected (is it glowing? cracked? screaming?)
- Lid sealed shut (viewing slit is your only window)
- First few seconds in darkness before Soulstone activates
- Then: servos hum, hydraulics pressurize, the machine wakes up

**During Combat:**
- **Vision:** Narrow slit view (tunnel vision, hard to track flanking enemies)
- **Sound:** Every impact reverberates through the casket (deafening)
- **Touch:** Phantom pain through neural threads (every hit feels like being stabbed)
- **Smell:** Your own sweat, metal, ozone from Soulstone discharge
- **Taste:** Blood (from biting tongue during impacts)
- **The Screaming:** If you listen carefully, you can hear the Soulstone soul's agony

**After Battle:**
- Lid opened by ground crew (blinding sunlight after hours in dim slit)
- Neural threads disconnected (agonizing nerve pain)
- Restraints released (legs don't work if you've been Shortened)
- Carried out on stretcher (even uninjured pilots can't walk afterward)
- Phantom sensations for hours (feeling 15 feet tall, fingers twitching)

## Faction Approaches to Casket Technology

| Faction | Philosophy | Casket Customization |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Church of Absolution** | Penance through service—pilot and soul earn redemption together | Blessed steel, prayer bells, flagellation attachments |
| **Dwarven Forge-Guilds** | Engineering perfection—refine both machine and operator | Runic inscriptions, modular components, precision-crafted joints |
| **The Ossuarium** | Efficiency obsession—remove all unnecessary flesh/sentiment | Bone plating, skeletal motifs, soul-binding chains |
| **Elven Verdant Covenant** | Reluctant symbiosis—merge nature with machine, mourn the necessity | Living wood chassis, vine hydraulics, thorn weapons |
| **The Exchange** | Economic asset—caskets are investments, pilots are operators | Vault-plated armor, currency storage, repossession kill-switches |
| **Nomad Collective** | Pragmatic survival—patchwork repairs, salvaged parts | Jury-rigged components, scrap armor, lucky charms |
| **Wyrd Conclave** | Reality manipulation—caskets as art installations | Impossible geometry, phase-shifting, stolen aesthetics |
| **Vestige Bloodlines** | Bio-mechanical evolution—graft pilot and machine into one organism | Organic plating, adaptive limbs, mutation integration |
| **Emergent Syndicate** | Hive-mind coordination—multiple pilots share consciousness | Chitinous armor, pheromone emitters, collective targeting |
| **Crucible Packs** | Explosive worship—bombs on legs, glory in detonation | Scavenged explosives, fireproof plating, dead-man switches |

## The Moral Debate

### Arguments For Caskets

**Survival Necessity:**
- Without Caskets, humanity cannot fight Abominations or defend territory
- The alternative is extinction

**Voluntary Service:**
- Pilots volunteer (sign contracts, receive compensation for families)
- Soul-binding for Soulstones is often consensual (pre-death agreements)

**Dual Sacrifice:**
- Both pilot and soul are suffering together
- Some factions view this as "shared penance" (Church doctrine)

### Arguments Against Caskets

**Slavery (Twice Over):**
- Living pilot is trapped, strapped, mutilated, cannot escape
- Bound soul is imprisoned, powerless, screaming in crystal prison
- Both are exploited for military/economic purposes

**Exploitation:**
- Many pilots are desperate (starving, debt-ridden, dying)
- Many souls are bound involuntarily (battlefield recovery, executions)
- "Voluntary" is debatable when the alternative is starvation

**Moral Corruption:**
- Using trapped souls as batteries is fundamentally wrong
- Mutilating living humans for performance is inhumane
- Society becomes desensitized to horror (normalization of atrocity)

> *"Every Casket is two prisons. One for the living. One for the dead. We built them because we were desperate. We keep building them because we've forgotten how to be horrified."*
> — Rootwarden Kess

## Manufacturing in Year 437

**Can New Caskets Be Built?**

Yes, but with difficulty:

| Type | Quality | Availability | Source |
|------|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Pre-Sundering Originals** | Excellent | Rare (finite supply) | Scavenged from ruins |
| **Ossuarium Refurbished** | Very Good | Uncommon | Original frames + new components |
| **Dwarven Custom Builds** | Good craftsmanship, inferior materials | Limited (slow production) | Forged from scratch |
| **Faction Patchwork** | Fair to Poor | Common | Salvaged parts + improvisation |

**The Problem:**
- No factories, no industrial infrastructure
- Lost engineering knowledge (400+ years of decay)
- Scarce advanced materials (titanium, fusion cells)
- Every new casket is inferior to pre-Sundering originals

## Designer Notes

**For 3D Printing:**
- Casket core = modular torso with standardized limb attachment points
- Soulstone Core = separate swappable piece (back-mounted socket)
- Viewing slit = thin gap in front face (can see pilot interior if desired)
- Neural threads = optional detail (thin rods/wires from pilot hands to casket joints)
- Faction variants = different limb designs, armor plating, aesthetic customization

**Key Visual Element:**
When you look at a Casket from the front, you should see:
1. The narrow viewing slit (pilot's eyes barely visible inside)
2. The Soulstone glow on the back (purple/green halo)
3. The modular limbs (clearly attachable/swappable)
4. The faction aesthetic (Church crosses, Dwarf runes, Ossuarium bones, etc.)

**The Horror Should Be Visible:**
This isn't a sleek sci-fi mech. This is an industrial coffin with a living person strapped inside, powered by a screaming crystal, puppeted via strings drilled through their fingers.

Make it look uncomfortable. Make it look wrong. Make it look desperate.

Because that's what it is.
