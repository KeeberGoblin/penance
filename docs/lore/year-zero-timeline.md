## Day 4-7: The Hunker-Down

### Day 4-5 - Finding Shelter

**Survivor Strategies**:
- **Underground**: Subway tunnels, basements, bunkers (safest)

- **Fortified**: Barricaded buildings (temporary safety)

**Who Survives**:
- **Preppers**: Those with emergency supplies (water, food, weapons)
- **Military**: Organized units with command structure intact
- **Rural communities**: Already self-sufficient (wells, livestock, generators)
- **Lucky**: Right place, right time (pure chance)

**Who Dies**:
- **Urban populations**: 95% mortality (density, dependence on infrastructure)

## Week 2-4: Stabilization Attempts

### Week 2 (Day 8-14) - Scavenging Phase

**Survivor Priorities**:
1. **Water**: Find clean sources (rivers, wells, rain collection)
2. **Food**: Scavenge stores, hunt/fish (agriculture impossible during Ashfall Winter)
3. **Shelter**: Fortify against cold, Void creatures, raiders

**Void Activity Increases**:
- Abominations appear daily (spreading from the Scar)
- **The Pattern**: More active at night, avoid daylight
- Survivors learn: Stay inside after dark

**Proto-Factions Form**:
- **Religious survivors** → (future Church of Absolution)
- **Mining communities** → (future Dwarven Forge-Guilds)
- **Refugee caravans** → (future Nomad Collective)

### Week 3 (Day 15-21) - Violence Peaks

**Warlord Era Begins**:
- Strongest survivors claim territory (warlordism)
- "Might makes right" becomes default law
- No central authority (survival of the fittest)

**Resource Wars**:
- Battles over: Fuel, food, weapons, medicine
- Former friends/neighbors turn on each other
- **Trust evaporates** (paranoia becomes survival trait)

**Bonelord Thresh's Expansion**:
- Thresh experiments with more soul-bindings
- Finds 23 additional corpses, binds all of them
- **The First Casket Platoon** (24 soul-powered exoskeletons)

### Week 4 (Day 22-30) - The New Normal

**Ashfall Winter Intensifies**:
- Global temperature now -10°C below pre-Sundering
- Snow in tropical regions (unprecedented)
- Agriculture completely failed (starvation looming)

**Survivor Count**: ~750 million (50 million died week 2-4)

**Social Structure**:
- Tribal groups (10-500 members)

**Casualties Month 2**: 120 million dead (cumulative: 6.87 billion)

### Month 3-5 (Day 61-150) - Adaptation

- **Fire worship** (Crucible Packs): Volcanoes provide heat, light, and sulfur for explosives
- **Underground living** (proto-Dwarves): Deep shelters warmer, safer from Void
- **Nomadic lifestyle** (proto-Nomads): Keep moving, scavenge new areas
- **Faith** (proto-Church): Religion provides hope, social cohesion

- Survivors realize: *The Void is learning*

**The First Defender**:
- Bonelord Thresh's Casket army defends survivor camp (500 people)
- **Victory**: 24 Caskets kill 80+ Abominations
- Survivors see value in Thresh's "necromancy"
- **Church protests** but can't deny effectiveness

**Casualties Month 6**: 20 million dead (cumulative: 6.97 billion)

## Month 7-12: The Thaw

### Month 7-8 (Day 181-240) - Ash Settles

**Climate Shift**:
- Volcanic ash begins settling from atmosphere
- Sunlight increases (still dim, but visible)
- Temperature rises slightly (-5°C below pre-Sundering)

**Agriculture Attempts**:
- First crops planted (ash-resistant grains)
- 80% fail (soil contaminated, climate unstable)
- 20% succeed (hope returns)

### Month 9-10 (Day 241-300) - Faction Coalescence

### Month 11-12 (Day 301-365) - Year 0 Ends

**Survivor Count (Day 365)**: ~680 million (down from 7.5 billion)

**What Changed in One Year**:
- **Civilization ended**: No nations, no governments, no global order
- **Technology regressed**: From digital age to medieval-style warfare (with Caskets)
- **Society splintered**: Factions replace countries
- **Reality corrupted**: Void is permanent (not healing)

**What Survived**:
- Humanity (barely)
- Hope (fragile)
- Records (some knowledge preserved)
- **The Scar** (still bleeding Void energy, still singing)

---

## Legacy of Year 0

**437 Years Later**:
- Factions still tell stories of "The First Year" (oral tradition)
- Holidays mark Day 0 (Day of Screaming, Day of Ash, Day of Silence)
- Survivors of Year 0 are legendary (all dead by Year 50)
- **The Question**: Could humanity have prevented this?

**The Answer**: Probably not. Theslar didn't know what he was building.
