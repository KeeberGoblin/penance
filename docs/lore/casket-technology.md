# Casket Technology - Origins & Mechanics

**Official Designation**: Soul-Powered Autonomous Combat Chassis (SPACC)
**Common Name**: Caskets (because they're "coffins with legs")
**Inventor**: Dr. Bonelord Thresh (Year 0, Day 6)

---

## Pre-Sundering Origins

### What Were Caskets Before Year 0?

**Industrial Exoskeletons** (Year -50 to Year 0):
- Heavy-duty powered armor for construction, mining, disaster response
- Powered by compact fusion cells (pre-Void technology)
- **Not military**: Civilian/industrial use only (military had powered armor, but different designs)
- Common in: deep-sea drilling, space construction, hazardous material handling

**Key Manufacturers**:
- **Titan Industries**: Heavy mining exoskeletons ("Titan-class frames")
- **Prometheus Corp**: Disaster response suits (fireproof, radiation-shielded)
- **Atlas Engineering**: Construction frames (load-bearing, precision tools)

**Technical Specs (Pre-Sundering)**:
- **Power Source**: Miniature fusion reactors (20-year lifespan)
- **Strength**: Could lift 2-5 tons depending on model
- **Speed**: 8-12 mph walking speed (not designed for combat)
- **Armor**: Reinforced steel plating (protection from industrial hazards, not weapons)
- **Control**: Neural interface headset (user's brainwaves control movement)

## The Theslar Event Impact

### Why Caskets Survived When Everything Else Failed

**The EMP (Year 0, Day 0, 14:32 UTC)**:
- Theslar Engine detonation released massive electromagnetic pulse
- **94% of electronics destroyed** (computers, phones, cars, power grids)
- Modern civilization's technology instantly obsolete

**But Caskets Endured**:
- Fusion cells were **shielded** (radiation protection for industrial safety)
- Mechanical systems were **analog backups** (hydraulics, not just electronics)
- Neural interface used **bioelectric signals** (organic, not digital)
- **Result**: Caskets continued functioning when everything else died

**Irony**: The most primitive modern tech became the most advanced post-Sundering tech

## Year 0, Day 6: The First Soul-Binding

### Dr. Marcus Thresher's Discovery

**The Situation**:
- Dr. Marcus Thresher (mechanical engineer, age 42)
- Trapped in collapsing research facility (aftershock from Theslar Event)
- Surrounded by corpses of colleagues (27 dead, including his wife Dr. Elena Thresher)
- Wearing experimental Titan-class mining exoskeleton

**The Desperation**:
- Exoskeleton's fusion cell damaged in collapse (power failing)
- No rescue coming (all communications dead)
- **Choice**: Die in the rubble, or try anything

**The Experiment**:
- Thresher was studying "bioelectric resonance" before Sundering
- **Theory**: Human nervous system generates electromagnetic field (the "soul" is electrical)
- **Hypothesis**: If souls are electrical, maybe they can power machines

**The Breakthrough** (Day 6, Hour 14):
1. Thresher connected corpse's nervous system to exoskeleton's power interface
2. Used improvised resonance chamber (scavenged from lab equipment)
3. "Tuned" corpse's residual bioelectric field to exoskeleton's frequency
4. **It worked**: Dead colleague's soul began powering the machine

**Dr. Thresher's First Words as Bonelord Thresh**:
> "Elena... I'm sorry. But you're still alive. In a way. I can feel you in the machine. You're angry. But you're *here*."

## Soul-Binding Mechanics

### How It Works

**The Science** (as understood by Ossuarium):

1. **Soul = Bioelectric Pattern**
   - Human consciousness is electromagnetic field generated by brain
   - At death, this field persists briefly (30 seconds to 2 minutes)
   - Void energy allows this field to persist *indefinitely* (Theslar Event side-effect)

2. **The Resonance Chamber**
   - Device that "captures" soul's electromagnetic signature
   - Binds soul to mechanical system (Casket's power core)
   - Soul's energy output powers Casket's hydraulics, servos, and systems

3. **The Ledger**
   - Ossuarium's master record of all bound souls
   - Tracks: Original identity, binding date, current Casket assignment, "debt" owed
   - **Bonelord Thresh's obsession**: Maintaining perfect records (guilt over using corpses)

**The Ethics**:
- **Ossuarium View**: Souls are willing participants (most signed contracts pre-death)
- **Church View**: Abomination (enslaving the dead is sin)
- **Dwarven View**: Pragmatic (if it works, use it, but keep detailed records)
- **Exchange View**: Profitable (souls are currency, Caskets are assets)

## Modern Casket Construction (Year 437)

### Can New Caskets Be Built?

**Short Answer**: Sort of.

**Manufacturing Status**:
- **Pre-Sundering Caskets**: Scavenged from ruins (original fusion-cell models)
- **Post-Sundering Caskets**: Rebuilt from scrap (inferior to pre-Sundering models)
- **Custom Caskets**: Faction-specific designs (Church uses blessed steel, Dwarves use runic plating)

**Why Not Mass-Produce?**:
1. **No factories**: Industrial infrastructure destroyed in Sundering
2. **Lost knowledge**: Engineers who built Caskets are 400+ years dead
3. **Resource scarcity**: Advanced materials (titanium alloys, fusion cells) rare
4. **Soul scarcity**: Requires constant supply of corpses (ethical limits)

**Faction Production Capabilities**:

| Faction | Can Build New Caskets? | Method |
|---------|------------------------|--------|
| **The Ossuarium** | Yes (best) | Industrial-scale scavenging + soul-binding expertise |
| **Dwarven Forge-Guilds** | Yes (limited) | Forge custom frames from scrap metal, inferior to pre-Sundering |
| **Church of Absolution** | No (repair only) | Maintain existing Caskets via prayer and penance |
| **The Exchange** | No (broker only) | Buy/sell Caskets, don't manufacture |
| **Nomad Collective** | No (scavenge only) | Salvage broken Caskets from battlefields |
| **Others** | No | Entirely dependent on Ossuarium/Dwarves for new frames |

## Casket Components

### Anatomy of a Casket

**1. Soul Core** (Power Source):
- Resonance chamber containing bound soul
- Located in chassis center (most protected component)
- **Damage to Soul Core**: Releases soul (instant Casket shutdown)
- **Soul Escape**: Soul dissipates into Void (true death, no afterlife)

**2. Chassis** (Body):
- Reinforced steel/titanium frame
- Houses soul core, hydraulic systems, and armor plating
- **Weight**: 800-2,400 lbs depending on class (Scout to Fortress)

**3. Limbs** (Arms & Legs):
- Hydraulic-powered (soul energy drives pumps)
- Modular (can be replaced if damaged)
- **Right Arm**: Primary weapon mount
- **Left Arm**: Shield/off-hand weapon mount
- **Legs**: Locomotion + balance systems

**4. Head** (Sensor Suite):
- Optics, audio sensors, targeting systems
- **No brain**: Soul Core controls movement, not a physical pilot
- Purely functional (some factions add decorative helms for intimidation)

**5. Deck System** (Soul Manifestation):
- Cards represent soul's memories/skills manifesting as actions
- Deck size = soul's remaining vitality (damage reduces deck)
- **Death**: When deck reaches 0 cards, soul burns out (Casket falls)

## Soul Procurement

### Where Do Souls Come From?

**The Ossuarium's Methods**:

1. **Voluntary Contracts** (70% of souls):
   - Citizens sign soul-binding contracts before death
   - **Terms**: Serve 20 years in Casket, then soul released (supposedly)
   - **Payment**: Family receives compensation (food, housing, protection)
   - **Reality**: Most souls serve indefinitely (Thresh "extends" contracts)

2. **Criminal Souls** (20% of souls):
   - Convicted criminals sentenced to "soul servitude"
   - No contract, no release clause
   - **Church View**: Just punishment (better than execution)

3. **Battlefield Salvage** (10% of souls):
   - Corpses scavenged from wars
   - **No consent**: Morally questionable, but desperate times
   - **Faction Wars**: Major source of new souls (Ossuarium benefits from conflict)

**Other Factions**:
- **Church**: Only binds martyrs who volunteered (extremely rare)
- **Dwarves**: Bind honored dead with family permission
- **Crucible**: Don't bind souls (cremate dead, consider soul-binding heresy)

---

## The Soul Experience

### What Does It Feel Like to Be a Casket?

**According to Ossuarium Soul Interviews** (rare, controversial):

**Sensory Experience**:
- **Vision**: See through Casket's optical sensors (monochrome, thermal, or night vision modes)
- **Hearing**: Hear through audio pickups (can't speak, but can transmit via radio)
- **Touch**: Feel pressure/damage via hydraulic feedback (phantom pain)
- **Taste/Smell**: None (souls report "sensory deprivation" as worst part)

**Emotional State**:
- **Awareness**: Fully conscious, aware of being dead
- **Emotion**: Range from acceptance to rage to despair
- **Time Perception**: Distorted (some souls experience centuries as minutes)
- **Degradation**: Soul's memory/personality erodes over time (20-50 year decline)

**The Horror**:
- Souls cannot sleep, cannot dream, cannot die naturally
- Trapped until Casket is destroyed or soul core fails
- **Church's Argument**: This is worse than death (enslavement of consciousness)

## Faction Relationships with Caskets

### Cultural Attitudes

**The Ossuarium** (Creators):
- **View**: Caskets are tools, souls are fuel
- **Bonelord Thresh**: Views soul-binding as tragic necessity (haunted by guilt)
- **The Ledger**: Obsessive record-keeping to honor the dead (or assuage conscience)

**Church of Absolution** (Condemners):
- **Doctrine**: Soul-binding is sin (prevents souls from reaching afterlife)
- **Hypocrisy**: Church uses Caskets (justifies as "penance for martyrs")
- **Tension**: Church needs Caskets to fight, but hates relying on them

**Dwarven Forge-Guilds** (Pragmatists):
- **View**: Caskets are engineering marvels (respect the craftsmanship)
- **Ethics**: Only bind souls with consent and honor contracts
- **Innovation**: Dwarves modify Caskets with runic enhancements

**The Exchange** (Merchants):
- **View**: Caskets are commodities (buy low, sell high)
- **Soul Contracts**: Exchange brokers soul-binding agreements (profit from both sides)
- **Morality**: None (profit trumps ethics)

**Crucible Packs** (Rejectors):
- **View**: Soul-binding is heresy (fire purifies, ash honors dead)
- **Belief**: Bound souls can't reach the First Forge (denied afterlife)
- **Exception**: Some goblinoids use Caskets grudgingly (scavenged, never custom-built)

## Lost Technology

### What Can't Be Replicated?

**Pre-Sundering Innovations** (no longer possible):

1. **Fusion Cells**: Modern Caskets use soul cores exclusively (can't make new fusion reactors)
2. **Neural Lace**: Original exoskeletons had brain-computer interfaces (lost knowledge)
3. **Nanotech Armor**: Some military exoskeletons had self-repairing plating (extinct)
4. **AI Assistants**: Pre-Sundering Caskets had onboard AI (now inert or corrupted)

**Why Lost?**:
- Engineers who understood the technology are dead (400+ years)
- Manufacturing facilities destroyed (can't reverse-engineer without tools)
- **Some knowledge preserved**: Dwarven engineers hoard pre-Sundering technical manuals

---

## Campaign Integration

### Quest Hooks

**Quest: The Conscience Core**
- Players discover Casket with fully sentient soul (rare, most degrade)
- Soul begs for release (destroy core, free soul)
- **Choice**: Free soul (destroy valuable Casket) OR ignore pleas (keep asset)

**Quest: The Ledger Heist**
- Ossuarium's master Ledger contains names of all bound souls
- Faction wants Ledger stolen (blackmail material, or to free souls)
- **Moral Choice**: Steal Ledger (chaos) OR protect it (maintain order)

**Quest: Lost Fusion Cell**
- Pre-Sundering Casket found with functional fusion cell (priceless)
- Multiple factions want it (research, power source, or destroy as heresy)
- **Combat**: Factions war over ancient tech

---

## The Future of Caskets

**Year 437 and Beyond**:
- Soul supply dwindling (fewer deaths, more soul-binding competition)
- Factions research alternatives (Void-powered Caskets, risky and unstable)
- **Bonelord Thresh's Fear**: What happens when souls run out?

**Possible Futures**:
1. **Soul Scarcity War**: Factions fight over corpses (dystopian cannibalism)
2. **Void Alternative**: Caskets powered by Void energy (monstrous, corrupted)
3. **Technological Breakthrough**: Dwarves rediscover fusion cells (renaissance)
4. **Abolition**: Church successfully bans soul-binding (societal collapse)
