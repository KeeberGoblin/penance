## Design Philosophy

The Resonance Engine is **not a MacGuffin** - it's an interactive, dangerous location that players can attempt to influence, sabotage, or exploit. Inspired by Kingdom Death's sense of looming dread and asymmetric consequences, the Engine is:
- **A ticking clock** - it grows more unstable over time
- **A risk/reward zone** - entering the Sibarian Wastes is suicidal but lucrative
- **Factionally divisive** - each faction wants a different outcome
- **Never fully controllable** - players can influence, but not master

## What Is The Resonance Engine?

### Physical Description

The **Resonance Engine** is a miles-high tower of corroded brass and crystalline structures, standing in the exact center of the **Sibarian Wastes**. It pulses with a rhythmic thrum that can be felt for hundreds of miles - a heartbeat of reality-tearing energy.

**Appearance**:
- **Lower Levels (The Roots)**: Buried in corrupted earth, overgrown with Soulstone formations like cancerous tumors. Abominations nest here.
- **Mid-Levels (The Machine)**: Colossal gears, crackling arcane conduits, and catwalks suspended over Void rifts. The air is toxic with Taint.
- **Upper Levels (The Crown)**: A fractal spire where physics breaks down. Space folds, time loops, reality is... negotiable.
- **The Core**: At the heart of the Engine is **The Wound** - a tear in reality that bleeds Void energy into the world. It's beautiful. It's horrific. Looking at it too long causes madness.

**The Pulse**:
Every 6 hours, the Engine releases a **Resonance Pulse** - a wave of energy that:
- Causes Soulstones within 100 miles to glow brightly
- Triggers Strain rolls for any active Caskets in the Wastes
- Spawns 1d6 Abominations near the Engine
- Can be felt as a distant tremor across the entire continent

## The Engine's Threat Level

### Instability Track

The Resonance Engine has an **Instability Score**, ranging from 0 (dormant) to 20 (catastrophic).

**Current Instability**: Starts at **10** in Year 100 (game start)

Each campaign session, the Instability increases by +1 naturally (the Engine is degrading).

**Instability Effects**:

| Score | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0-5 | **Stable** - Engine is quiet. Abomination spawns are rare. Soulstones are scarce. |
| 6-10 | **Active** - Current state. Void rifts appear regularly. Soulstone growth is steady. |
| 11-15 | **Critical** - Resonance Pulses occur every 3 hours. Weather near the Engine becomes erratic (storms, gravity fluctuations). |
| 16-19 | **Cascading** - Reality begins breaking down beyond the Sibarian Wastes. Void rifts appear in civilized territories. Panic spreads. |
| 20+ | **The Second Sundering** - Campaign failure. The Engine detonates, triggering a second Cataclysm. World ends. |

### The Doomsday Clock

If players ignore the Engine, it **will** destroy the world. The campaign has a built-in timer:
- **15-20 missions** before Instability reaches 20 (depending on player actions)
- Players must decide: Destroy it? Stabilize it? Exploit it?

## Interacting With The Engine

### Expedition Missions

Players can undertake **Sibarian Wastes Expeditions** - high-risk missions into the exclusion zone.

**Expedition Structure**:
1. **Approach Phase**: Travel through corrupted terrain (2-3 encounters with Abominations)
2. **Engine Zone**: Reach the Engine itself, attempt objective
3. **Escape Phase**: Flee before the next Resonance Pulse (timed pressure)

**Standard Objectives**:
- **Soulstone Harvest**: Collect 1d6 Soulstone Fragments (300 Credits value each)
- **Sabotage**: Reduce Instability by 2 (risky, requires skill checks)
- **Research**: Gather data on the Engine (unlocks lore, potential solutions)
- **Scavenging**: Loot Old World tech from the ruins (rare equipment)

---

## Engine Interactions (Player Choices)

### 1. **Siphon Power** (Exploit)
**Action**: Install a Soulstone extractor near the Engine
**Cost**: 500 Credits, 5 Scrap, 1 mission to install
**Effect**:
- Generates 2 Soulstone Fragments per settlement phase (massive income)
- **Consequence**: Instability increases by +2 per phase (you're destabilizing it further)
- **Faction Response**: Forge-Guilds approve, Church condemns, Elves declare you enemies

**Narrative**: You're bleeding the Engine for resources, accelerating the apocalypse for short-term gain.

---

### 2. **Stabilize Core** (Repair)
**Action**: Reinforce the Engine's containment wards
**Cost**: 300 Credits, rare components (requires 3 successful research missions)
**Effect**:
- Reduces Instability by 3
- Slows natural decay (Instability increases by +1 every 2 phases instead of every phase)
- **Consequence**: Soulstone production drops by 50% globally (prices skyrocket)
- **Faction Response**: Dwarves approve, Scrap-Clans are angry (they profit from chaos), Fae are amused

**Narrative**: You're buying time, but at the cost of the resource everyone depends on.

---

### 3. **Destroy The Engine** (Church Endgame)
**Action**: Plant explosives at the Engine's core
**Cost**: 1,000 Credits, suicide mission (high chance of pilot death)
**Effect**:
- **If successful**: Instability drops to 0. Void rifts seal. Abominations stop spawning.
- **If successful (hidden consequence)**: ALL Soulstones become inert. Caskets lose power. World reverts to pre-Cataclysm tech levels. Famine follows.
- **If failed**: Instability jumps to 18. You've made it worse.
- **Faction Response**: Church celebrates, everyone else declares war on you

**Narrative**: You've "fixed" the problem... by removing magic entirely. Civilization collapses in a different way.

---

### 4. **Control The Engine** (Aberrant Endgame)
**Action**: Merge a pilot with the Engine's core (requires Taint 10, Aberrant Casket)
**Cost**: 1 pilot's life (permanently lost)
**Effect**:
- Instability locks at 10 (stable but active)
- Player gains control of **1 Resonance Pulse per mission** - can trigger Void rifts, spawn Abominations, or energize Soulstones at will
- **Consequence**: Merged pilot becomes an NPC - **The New Theslar**, a godlike entity with alien motivations
- **Faction Response**: Everyone fears you. You've become the villain.

**Narrative**: You've achieved godhood, but lost your humanity. The campaign continues with you as the final boss.

---

### 5. **Redirect The Tear** (Fae Endgame)
**Action**: Bargain with The Wyrd Conclave to move the Void rift elsewhere
**Cost**: A price determined by Mockingbird (see Iconic NPCs) - usually a soul, a memory, or a loved one
**Effect**:
- Instability drops to 5
- The Void rift moves to the **Feywild**, becoming the Fae's problem
- **Consequence**: Feywild and Material worlds merge partially - geography becomes unstable, time flows inconsistently, bargains become mandatory
- **Faction Response**: Fae are delighted, everyone else is horrified

**Narrative**: You've traded one apocalypse for a different, stranger one.

## Engine Hazards (Environmental Mechanics)

### Void Exposure

Any pilot operating within **5 hexes of the Engine** suffers:
- +1 Taint per round of exposure
- Strain rolls at -2 (increased malfunction chance)
- Heat does not vent naturally (must use active cooling)

**Madness Effects**:
If a pilot reaches Taint 8+ while near the Engine, roll 1d6:
1. **Visions**: Pilot sees alternate timelines. -2 Initiative for the mission.
2. **Compulsion**: Pilot is drawn toward the Core. Must make a willpower check or move 1 hex closer each turn.
3. **Conversion**: Pilot begins to crystallize (like Sister Vex). Gain +1 Defense but lose 1 movement permanently.
4. **Communion**: Pilot hears the Engine "speaking." Gain 1 piece of forbidden knowledge (GM reveals a secret).
5. **Rejection**: Pilot's body rejects the Soulstone. Lose 1 SP permanently.
6. **Apotheosis**: Pilot begins merging with their Casket. Gain +2 SP but cannot leave the Casket (ever).

---

### Resonance Pulse (Timed Event)

Every 6 hours (in-game time), the Engine releases a Pulse.

**Players in the Wastes when a Pulse occurs**:
1. All Caskets take 2 damage (ignores armor)
2. All pilots gain +1 Taint
3. Roll 1d6 per player:
   - 1-2: **Void Rift Opens** - 1d3 Abominations spawn in random hexes
   - 3-4: **Gravity Fluctuation** - All movement costs +1 SP this round
   - 5-6: **Time Skip** - 1 random player loses their next turn (frozen in looped time)

**Narrative Pressure**: Players have a ~2 hour window to complete objectives and escape before the next Pulse.

---

## The Core (Final Zone)

If players venture to the **Engine's Core** (the innermost chamber):

### The Wound

**Description**: A tear in reality, 50 feet across, hovering in mid-air. Through it, you can see:
- Impossible colors that hurt to perceive
- Stars that shouldn't exist
- Reflections of yourself making different choices

**Mechanical Effect**:
- **Looking at The Wound**: Make a willpower check (roll 1d6, succeed on 4+)
  - **Success**: Gain insight. Draw 2 cards.
  - **Failure**: Gain 2 Taint. Your character sees something they cannot unsee.

### The Control Mechanism

At the Core is a **Runic Interface** - the original controls Theslar used.

**Interactive Elements**:
1. **Power Regulator** - Can be set from 1-10
   - Higher setting = more Soulstone growth, higher Instability
   - Lower setting = less power, but Engine stabilizes
2. **Dimensional Anchor** - Can be toggled On/Off
   - Off = Void rift begins to close (Instability drops, but Soulstones die)
   - On = Current state
3. **Emergency Overload** - Red lever, clearly labeled "DO NOT PULL"
   - Triggers immediate Resonance Pulse
   - Instability +3
   - Everyone in the zone takes 5 damage
   - ??? (Players discover what happens if they pull it)

## Faction Goals (What They Want)

### Church of Absolution
**Goal**: Destroy the Engine completely
**Method**: Crusade missions, suicide bombers, holy wards
**Offer to Players**: 500 Credits + religious legitimacy if you help them

### Verdant Covenant
**Goal**: Harmonize the Engine with the Worldheart (stabilize without destroying)
**Method**: Plant World-Tree roots into the Engine's base, creating symbiosis
**Offer to Players**: Living weapon upgrades + access to Elven territories

### Forge-Guilds
**Goal**: Reverse-engineer the Engine, build a controlled version
**Method**: Research, data extraction, component salvage
**Offer to Players**: Cutting-edge tech, Runic inscriptions, 1,000 Credits

### Scrap-Clans
**Goal**: Don't care, just want to raid the Wastes for loot
**Method**: Smash and grab
**Offer to Players**: Fuck-all. They're competing with you for resources.

### The Ossuarium
**Goal**: Let it run forever (Void energy makes necromancy easier)
**Method**: Sabotage attempts to shut it down
**Offer to Players**: Undead reinforcements, forbidden knowledge

### The Wyrd Conclave
**Goal**: Keep the dimensional overlap active (benefits them)
**Method**: Bargains, deals, ensuring players make short-sighted choices
**Offer to Players**: Anything you want... for a price.

### Draconids
**Goal**: Survive the cycle, preserve knowledge
**Method**: Observe and record, but don't interfere
**Offer to Players**: Truth. They'll tell you what *really* happens if you destroy/stabilize/control it.

## Campaign Integration

### Early Campaign (Missions 1-5)
- Players hear rumors of the Engine
- Instability is 10-12 (not urgent yet)
- Optional scouting missions to the Wastes' edge

### Mid Campaign (Missions 6-10)
- Instability hits 13-15 (critical)
- Factions begin making aggressive moves toward the Engine
- Players must choose: Align with a faction, or go independent?

### Late Campaign (Missions 11-15)
- Instability at 16-18 (cascading failure imminent)
- Final assault on the Engine (players commit to an endgame choice)
- Consequences ripple across the world

---

## Sample Mission: "Heart of the Storm"

**Objective**: Reach the Engine's Core and retrieve data logs (for Forge-Guilds research)

**Map**: 15-hex linear path through the Wastes, ending at the Engine

**Encounters**:
- **Hex 1-5**: Corrupted terrain, Void exposure begins
- **Hex 6-10**: 2 waves of Abominations (Carrion Swarm, Shrieking Colossus)
- **Hex 11-15**: Engine interior - gravity fluctuations, time loops, environmental hazards
- **Core Chamber**: Download data (requires 3 turns of interaction). Resonance Pulse triggers in 6 rounds.

**Success**: 300 Credits, 1d3 Soulstone Fragments, research data (unlocks Stabilization project)

**Failure**: Lose 1 pilot to Void exposure, Instability +1

---

## Design Notes

### Why This Works
1. **Agency**: Players can interact with the Engine meaningfully
2. **Tension**: The Doomsday Clock creates urgency
3. **No Right Answer**: Every solution has brutal trade-offs (very Kingdom Death)
4. **Factional Conflict**: Players must navigate competing interests

### Avoiding Railroading
- Players can ignore the Engine entirely (they lose, but it's their choice)
- Multiple valid endgames (destroy, stabilize, control, redirect, exploit)
- Consequences are logical, not punitive

*"The Engine doesn't care about your plans. It simply is. The question is: what will you do about it?"*
