# Iconic NPC Pilots
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Version**: 0.1
**Last Updated**: October 10, 2025

---

## Design Philosophy

These NPCs are designed to be **memorable, flawed, and non-generic**. Inspired by Kingdom Death's approach:
- **No pure heroes or villains** - everyone is broken in different ways
- **Bodies tell stories** - physical mutations, scars, and modifications matter
- **Contradiction and irony** - their beliefs often conflict with their actions
- **Asymmetric abilities** - unique mechanics that can't be replicated
- **Tragic trajectories** - their stories end badly, one way or another

## 1. Sister Vex (Church of Absolution)
### "The Hollow Penitent"

**Faction**: Church of Absolution
**Casket Type**: Heavy - "The Confessional" (1,600 lbs)
**Taint Level**: 7 (Advanced Corruption)

#### Physical Description
Sister Vex no longer has a face. Where her eyes, nose, and mouth once were, there is now a smooth expanse of scar tissue, ritually burned away in an act of "purification." She navigates through a network of communion-stones surgically embedded in her skull, which pulse with dull red light when she "sees." Her body is covered in prayer-chains welded directly to her ribs, which jingle and tear at the skin when she moves.

She wears the robes of a High Penitent, but beneath them her flesh has begun to crystallize - patches of Soulstone growing directly from her bones like tumors. The Church calls this "blessed stigmata." She knows better.

#### Backstory
Vex was once the Inquisition's most feared prosecutor - a woman who burned suspected Taint-bearers with righteous fury. When her own daughter tested positive for Void corruption, Vex faced an impossible choice: execute her own child or admit the Church's doctrine was flawed.

She chose a third option: she took her daughter's Taint into herself through a forbidden blood ritual, hoping to "purify" it through her own penance. It didn't work. Her daughter died anyway, consumed by the transfer. Vex survived, but the Taint took root in her soul.

Rather than face execution, she mutilated herselfâ€”removing her face so she could no longer weep, becoming a "living penance." The Church, desperate for propaganda, declared her a saint. She piloted The Confessional into battle, seeking death with every sortie. Death refuses to take her.

#### Personality
- **Monotone and hollow** - speaks without inflection, as if reading from a script
- **Obsessive about ritual** - performs hourly self-flagellation, even mid-conversation
- **Paradoxically kind to the corrupted** - shows mercy to Taint-bearers, harshness to the "pure"
- **Suicidal but cannot die** - her Soulstone keeps regenerating fatal wounds

#### Unique Casket Abilities

**The Confessional** is a walking iron cathedral, covered in hanging chains and prayer bells. Its interior is a torture chamber where Vex pilots from a throne of nails.

**Special Mechanics**:
1. **Martyrdom Protocol** (Passive)
   - When The Confessional takes lethal damage, instead of dying, Vex may **sacrifice 1 Permanent Injury** to remain at 1 HP
   - Each use adds +2 Taint permanently
   - *"Pain is proof of devotion."*

2. **Penitent's Burden** (2 SP, Action)
   - Choose an ally within Range 2
   - Transfer up to 3 damage cards from their deck to yours
   - Gain 1 Heat per card transferred
   - *"I will bear your sins."*

3. **The Weight of Sin** (3 SP, Attack - Melee Range 1)
   - Deal 4 damage
   - For each point of Taint Vex has, deal +1 additional damage (max +7)
   - After resolving, Vex takes 1 damage per 2 Taint (rounded up)
   - *"Suffering sanctifies."*

#### Combat Behavior (AI Deck Pattern)
- **Prioritizes protecting corrupted units** over mission objectives
- **Will not retreat**, even at critical damage
- **Ignores self-preservation** - actively moves into dangerous positions
- **Focuses on enemies with lowest Taint** (views the "pure" as ignorant, needing to be taught pain)

#### Story Hooks
- The Church wants Vex as propaganda, but she's becoming a liability - players might be hired to "retire" her quietly
- Vex knows a secret ritual to remove Taint permanently, but it requires a sacrifice she refuses to make again
- She's been seen speaking to something that isn't there - is it her dead daughter, or something worse?

## 2. Rootwarden Kess (Verdant Covenant)
### "The Pruner"

**Faction**: Verdant Covenant (Elven)
**Casket Type**: Scout - "The Briar-Thorn" (650 lbs)
**Taint Level**: 0 (Immune - see below)

#### Physical Description
Kess is not entirely elven anymore. Her lower body has fused with her Casket - roots and vines growing through her legs, spine, and pelvis in a symbiotic nightmare. She cannot leave The Briar-Thorn; to do so would be to tear herself in half. Her skin has a greenish tint, and bark-like growths cover her shoulders and forearms.

Most disturbing are her hands: the fingers have split into twig-like appendages, allowing her to interface directly with her Casket's living wood. When she pilots, she *becomes* the machine, feeling its pain as her own.

Her eyes are solid amber - no pupils, no whites - and sap occasionally leaks from the corners like tears.

#### Backstory
Kess was a Rootwarden - a druidic order responsible for "pruning" corrupted sections of the Worldheart's ley lines. When a Void rift opened in her grove, she made a desperate choice: rather than let the corruption spread, she grafted herself to a juvenile World-Tree sapling and used it as a living filter, absorbing the Taint through the plant before it could reach the ley line.

It worked. The ley line was saved. But Kess paid the price: the sapling and her body merged irreversibly, and she became something neither plant nor elf. The Covenant calls her a hero. She calls herself a mistake.

Now she "prunes" in a different way - hunting sources of corruption and cutting them away with surgical precision. She believes the entire world is a garden, and she is the gardener. Everything that doesn't belong must be *removed*.

#### Personality
- **Eerily calm, even when killing** - violence is just pruning to her
- **Speaks in agricultural metaphors** - "Your roots are diseased." "You've overgrown your soil."
- **No concept of moral complexity** - things are either "healthy" or "blighted"
- **Obsessed with symmetry and balance** - will rearrange corpses after battle into aesthetically pleasing patterns

#### Unique Casket Abilities

**The Briar-Thorn** is a lithe, insectoid Casket made of living wood, constantly sprouting thorny vines that retract and extend like muscles.

**Special Mechanics**:
1. **Rootbound** (Passive - Curse)
   - Kess cannot be separated from The Briar-Thorn
   - If the Casket is destroyed, Kess dies instantly
   - In exchange: **Immune to Taint corruption** (her Casket filters it)
   - *"I am the soil. The world grows through me."*

2. **Pruning Strike** (1 SP, Attack - Melee Range 1)
   - Deal 2 damage
   - **Sever:** Choose one equipment slot on target (Right Arm, Left Arm, Legs, Chassis)
   - That component is disabled until repaired (even if not destroyed)
   - *"Cut away the diseased limb."*

3. **Overgrowth** (3 SP, Action - Range 0)
   - Place a **Vine Token** on Kess's current hex
   - Vine hexes count as Difficult Terrain for enemies
   - Allies may spend 1 SP while in a Vine hex to remove 1 Heat
   - Vine hexes last until end of mission
   - Kess may have up to 5 Vine hexes at once
   - *"The world heals where I walk."*

4. **Photosynthesis** (Passive)
   - At the start of each round, if Kess is standing in a Vine hex, draw 1 card
   - If the drawn card is a Damage card, instead remove it from the game (composted)
   - *"Life feeds on death."*

#### Combat Behavior (AI Deck Pattern)
- **Prioritizes high-Taint targets** - views them as "blighted"
- **Creates kill-zones** using Overgrowth, then lures enemies into them
- **Avoids direct confrontation** - Scout mobility for hit-and-run
- **Will execute downed opponents** rather than let them retreat (pruning must be thorough)

#### Story Hooks
- Kess has begun "pruning" settlements she deems "overgrown" - even those inhabited by innocents
- A faction wants to study her symbiosis with the Casket, believing it could cure Taint exposure
- Her sapling is still growing - eventually it will consume her entirely, and she knows it

## 3. Forgemaster Durr "The Calculator" (Forge-Guilds)
### "The Dwarven Equation"

**Faction**: Forge-Guilds (Dwarven)
**Casket Type**: Support - "The Abacus" (1,100 lbs)
**Taint Level**: 3 (Controlled/Measured)

#### Physical Description
Durr has replaced 60% of his body with clockwork prosthetics. His left arm is a multi-tool apparatus, his right leg is a piston-driven hydraulic limb, and his lungs have been augmented with brass bellows that wheeze audibly when he breathes. One eye has been replaced with a magnifying lens array that clicks and rotates when he focuses.

He's covered in self-inflicted scars from "measurement experiments" - testing pain thresholds, burn tolerance, and structural integrity of his own bones. His beard is singed and patchy from forge accidents, and his hands are covered in acid burns from Soulstone refinement.

Most disturbing: he's installed a pressure gauge in his own chest, visible through a glass window in his sternum, which tracks his blood pressure in real-time. He obsessively checks it, adjusting his breathing to keep it at exactly 120/80.

#### Backstory
Durr was the lead engineer on Project Echo Project - a Dwarven attempt to replicate Theslar's original Engine on a smaller, controlled scale. The experiment failed catastrophically, killing his entire research team and leaving Durr buried under rubble for three days.

When they dug him out, he'd calculated the exact engineering failure that caused the collapse - a rounding error in the 47th decimal place of a load-bearing formula. The realization broke something in him: if a single rounding error could kill 200 dwarves, then the entire universe was a poorly designed machine running on faulty math.

He now treats everything - emotions, combat, morality - as engineering problems to be solved through calculation. He rebuilt himself with prosthetics to "eliminate biological inefficiencies," and pilots The Abacus with cold, mathematical precision.

#### Personality
- **Emotionally flat** - expresses everything in equations and probabilities
- **Obsessed with efficiency** - will sacrifice allies if the math favors it
- **Compulsively measures everything** - carries calipers, scales, and timers at all times
- **Views organics as inferior machines** - increasingly contemptuous of "flesh-logic"

#### Unique Casket Abilities

**The Abacus** is a boxy, geometric Casket covered in measurement instruments, gears, and clicking counters. It hums with mechanical precision.

**Special Mechanics**:
1. **Probability Matrix** (Passive)
   - Durr always knows the **exact number of cards** remaining in all decks (his, allies', enemies', AI behavior decks)
   - Once per turn, he may look at the top 3 cards of any deck, then return them in any order
   - *"Randomness is just insufficient data."*

2. **Calculated Sacrifice** (2 SP, Action - Range 3)
   - Choose an ally within range
   - That ally takes 2 damage
   - All other allies within Range 2 of the target gain +2 to their next attack this round
   - *"Acceptable losses for optimal outcome."*

3. **Emergency Overdrive** (3 SP, Reaction - Self)
   - When Durr would take damage, he may activate this ability
   - Redirect the damage to a random component (roll 1d4: 1=R.Arm, 2=L.Arm, 3=Legs, 4=Chassis)
   - That component takes double damage
   - *"Targeted failure is superior to systemic collapse."*

4. **Field Refit** (2 SP, Action - Range 1)
   - Choose an ally
   - They may swap 2 cards between their hand and discard pile
   - Remove 1 Heat from target
   - *"Recalibration complete."*

#### Combat Behavior (AI Deck Pattern)
- **Calculates optimal targets** using Probability Matrix (attacks weakest statistical link in enemy formation)
- **Will sacrifice allies** if it improves win probability by >15%
- **Retreats precisely at 40% HP remaining** - never fights to the death (inefficient)
- **Ignores emotional appeals** - cannot be intimidated, cannot be bargained with

#### Story Hooks
- Durr has calculated that destroying The Engine has a 73% chance of global extinction - he'll kill anyone trying to shut it down
- He's been secretly replacing his organic brain with mechanical components - how much of "Durr" is left?
- A rival Forge-Guild wants his Probability Matrix tech - players might be hired to extract his brain (literally)

## 4. Bonelord Thresh (The Ossuarium)
### "The Debt Collector"

**Faction**: The Ossuarium (Undead)
**Casket Type**: Assault - "The Creditor" (2,200 lbs)
**Taint Level**: N/A (Undead - immune to corruption via technicality)

#### Physical Description
Thresh is a skeletal lich wrapped in tattered finery - nobleman's robes from the Old World, now moth-eaten and bloodstained. His skull is pristine ivory, polished to a mirror sheen, with rubies socketed in his eye sockets that glow with cold light.

His bones are inscribed with contracts - thousands of names etched in microscopic script, covering every surface of his skeleton. These are souls he "owns" through predatory necromantic pacts. When he speaks, the names whisper in chorus.

Most unsettling: Thresh has *too many bones*. Extra ribs, redundant finger bones, spare vertebrae - all from previous owners, grafted onto his frame like grotesque trophies. He occasionally removes a bone and offers it as "payment" for services rendered.

#### Backstory
Before the Cataclysm, Thresh was a loan shark and contract lawyer - a man who made fortunes exploiting the desperate. When the Sundering occurred, he saw opportunity: in the chaos, he made necromantic pacts with dying survivors, promising "eternal life" in exchange for "small favors after death."

Hundreds took the deal. They didn't read the fine print.

Thresh kept his promises - he did grant eternal life. But the contracts stipulated that the soul remained *his property*, to be called upon for labor, combat, or experimentation. He's built an undead empire on predatory lending, and his "collection agency" enforces debts with brutal efficiency.

He pilots The Creditor into battle not for glory, but for **acquisition** - every enemy killed is a potential asset to be repossessed.

#### Personality
- **Relentlessly polite** - always uses formal titles, never raises his voice
- **Obsessed with contracts and debts** - views all relationships as transactions
- **Patient and calculating** - willing to wait centuries for the "right moment" to collect
- **Surprisingly honest** - never lies, but always finds loopholes

#### Unique Casket Abilities

**The Creditor** is a massive, iron sarcophagus on legs, covered in ledgers and tally marks. Souls scream from its vents.

**Special Mechanics**:
1. **Predatory Pact** (2 SP, Action - Range 2)
   - Choose an enemy within range
   - Offer them a bargain: "Take 2 damage now, or owe a *debt*"
   - If they refuse (take damage), nothing happens
   - If they accept (owe debt), place a **Debt Token** on them
   - **Debt Mechanic**: At any point before the end of the mission, Thresh may **collect the debt** as a free action:
     - The debtor must immediately discard 3 cards OR take 4 damage (their choice)
     - If this would kill them, Thresh gains control of their corpse for 1 round
   - *"All debts come due."*

2. **Soul Harvest** (Passive)
   - When an enemy dies within Range 2 of Thresh, gain a **Soul Token**
   - Spend 1 Soul Token: Draw 1 card
   - Spend 2 Soul Tokens: Remove 2 Heat
   - Spend 3 Soul Tokens: Summon a **Bonded Thrall** (minion) in an adjacent hex
   - *"Your death is merely a change of employer."*

3. **Compound Interest** (Passive - Debuff)
   - For each **Debt Token** on the battlefield, Thresh gains +1 Defense (max +5)
   - *"Insolvency is its own punishment."*

4. **Foreclosure** (4 SP, Attack - Range 3)
   - Deal 5 damage to target
   - If target has a **Debt Token**, this attack deals double damage (10) and removes the token
   - *"I'm calling in your loan."*

#### Combat Behavior (AI Deck Pattern)
- **Prioritizes spreading Debt Tokens** early in combat
- **Collects debts** at the worst possible moment for the debtor (when they're low on cards/HP)
- **Focuses on weakened enemies** to maximize Soul Harvest
- **Never pursues fleeing enemies** - "they'll be back to settle their accounts eventually"

#### Story Hooks
- Players discover one of them unknowingly signed a contract with Thresh in a past life - he's come to collect
- A resistance movement wants to destroy Thresh's "Ledger of Souls" - a relic containing all his contracts
- Thresh offers players a deal too good to refuse... with predictably terrible fine print

## 5. Mockingbird (The Wyrd Conclave - Fae)
### "The Many-Masked Bargainer"

**Faction**: The Wyrd Conclave (Fae)
**Casket Type**: Aberrant - "The Mirror-Dance" (800 lbs - variable)
**Taint Level**: ??? (Unmeasurable - Fae physiology is weird)

#### Physical Description
Mockingbird doesn't have a face. Or rather, she has too many. She wears a constantly shifting array of porcelain masks, each representing a different identity she's stolen over the centuries. The masks phase in and out of existence, flickering like reflections in broken mirrors.

Beneath the masks, there's nothing - just a void filled with distant stars and impossible geometries.

Her body is similarly unstable: sometimes she has two arms, sometimes six, sometimes none. Her height varies by several feet from moment to moment. Her voice is a chorus of stolen identities, speaking in overlapping echoes.

The only constant is her Casket's core - a mirror-polished sphere that reflects not what *is*, but what *could be*.

#### Backstory
Mockingbird is old - old enough that she doesn't remember her true name, if she ever had one. She is a collector of *possibilities* - alternate versions of events that never happened. When the Sundering opened dimensional rifts, she walked through, fascinated by this new, broken world.

She doesn't fight for territory or resources. She fights for *stories* - collecting the "what-ifs" of every battle. What if the hero turned coward? What if the villain showed mercy? What if the dead lived and the living died?

She steals these alternate outcomes and wears them like masks, becoming a walking archive of roads not taken. Some say she's trying to find the version of reality where the Cataclysm never happened. Others say she's the reason it happened in the first place.

#### Personality
- **Playful and cruel in equal measure** - treats combat like performance art
- **Speaks in riddles and hypotheticals** - "What if I told you the sky was the ground?"
- **Obsessed with bargains** - will trade anything for a good story
- **No concept of linear time** - references events that haven't happened yet

#### Unique Casket Abilities

**The Mirror-Dance** is an impossible Casket - its parts don't connect logically, suspended in space like a cubist painting given motion.

**Special Mechanics**:
1. **Stolen Reflection** (2 SP, Action - Range 2)
   - Choose an enemy
   - Copy one ability from their Casket (weapon attack, special ability, racial trait)
   - Mockingbird may use that ability for the rest of the mission (costs normal SP)
   - May have up to 3 stolen abilities at once
   - *"I'll borrow that, thank you."*

2. **What-If Paradox** (3 SP, Reaction - Self)
   - When Mockingbird would take damage, she may activate this ability
   - Declare a "What-If" alternate outcome: "What if that attack missed?" "What if I was standing 2 hexes to the left?" "What if I was made of glass?"
   - Roll 1d6:
     - **1-2:** The What-If fails, take double damage
     - **3-4:** The What-If partially succeeds, take half damage (round up)
     - **5-6:** The What-If fully succeeds, negate all damage
   - *"Reality is negotiable."*

3. **Mirror-Walk** (1 SP, Movement - Special)
   - Mockingbird does not move normally
   - Instead, she may **teleport** to any hex within Range 3 that is:
     - Currently occupied by an ally OR
     - Adjacent to an enemy OR
     - Reflecting terrain (water, ice, metal debris)
   - *"I am wherever you see me."*

4. **Bargain of Masks** (0 SP, Passive - Ongoing)
   - At the start of the mission, Mockingbird may offer each player a **Mask Bargain**:
     - Player gains +2 to all attacks this mission
     - In exchange: Mockingbird may, once this mission, force the player to reroll any single die roll of hers
   - Players who accept receive a **Mask Token**
   - *"A small price for power, don't you think?"*

#### Combat Behavior (AI Deck Pattern)
- **Unpredictable targeting** - rolls randomly to choose targets (she's "collecting stories")
- **Prioritizes stealing unique abilities** - ignores basic attacks, focuses on rare powers
- **Retreats at 50% HP** - only to return 2 rounds later fully healed (she "wasn't really there")
- **Offers mid-combat bargains** to players - terribly tempting, always cursed

#### Story Hooks
- Mockingbird claims she can undo any event - even death - for the right price
- She's been collecting "masks" of the players - alternate versions where they made different choices
- She knows where the original Engine blueprints are hidden - but wants a "story worth telling" in trade

## Using These NPCs in Play

### As Antagonists
Each NPC can serve as a **Raid Boss** with their own AI behavior deck, or as recurring campaign villains with shifting motivations.

### As Allies
Players might temporarily ally with these NPCs during crisis events (Abomination raids, faction wars), creating uncomfortable partnerships.

### As Faction Representatives
Use these NPCs during **Faction Negotiation scenes** - they embody their faction's philosophy but in twisted, extreme ways.

### As Cautionary Tales
These NPCs show players what happens when you lean too hard into Casket piloting:
- **Vex** - martyrdom becomes addiction
- **Kess** - you merge with your machine
- **Durr** - you lose your humanity to optimization
- **Thresh** - you exploit others until you're hollow
- **Mockingbird** - you forget what's real

---

## Alternate NPC Concepts (Brief)

If you want additional NPCs for variety:

### 6. **Skarn "The Unbroken"** (Scrap-Clans - Orc)
- **Archetype**: The sole survivor of a Casket battle royale who refuses to leave his destroyed Casket
- **Hook**: His Casket is technically non-functional, held together by spite and scar tissue
- **Twist**: He's piloting a corpse, but keeps winning anyway

### 7. **Duskwind the Chronicler** (Draconid Remembrance)
- **Archetype**: Ancient Draconid who's seen the Cataclysm happen *three times before*
- **Hook**: Fatalistic, bored, pilots a Casket built from actual dragon bones
- **Twist**: Trying to engineer the *fourth* Cataclysm because "maybe this time it'll stick"

---

## 6. "Three-Card" Morrow (Nomad Collective)
### "The Drifter King"

**Faction**: Nomad Collective
**Casket Type**: Scout - "The Tumbledown" (720 lbs, heavily modified)
**Taint Level**: 4 (Fluctuating - see below)

#### Physical Description
Morrow has the weathered look of someone who's spent decades in the Wastes. His skin is tanned leather, crisscrossed with radiation scars and frostbite damage. What makes him memorable is the **three playing cards** permanently embedded in his left eye socket - the Ace of Spades, Nine of Hearts, and Joker - fused there by a Soulstone explosion. He claims he can see the future through them. Sometimes he's right.

His right arm is entirely prosthetic - not military-grade Church steel, but **scavenged junk** held together with wire and prayers. It's covered in trinkets: rabbit feet, dice, compass needles, all welded onto the forearm like armor. He says each one is a "good luck charm from someone who didn't need it anymore."

The Tumbledown is a patchwork Casket - no two armor plates match, and half the systems are held together with duct tape and spite. It shouldn't work. But it does.

#### Backstory
Morrow used to run a convoy across the Wastes - twelve rigs, forty souls, enough supplies to start a settlement. On Day 6 of the crossing, they hit an unmarked Void rift. The entire convoy was swallowed except for Morrow's truck. He survived. Everyone else died screaming.

The guilt broke something in him. He became a **drifter** - wandering the Wastes, gambling with death, taking insane risks as if daring fate to finally collect. He started carrying **three playing cards** as a reminder: "You're dealt three chances. I used mine. Everyone I meet is on borrowed time."

The cards embedded in his eye when a Soulstone engine detonated two feet from his face. Should've killed him. Didn't. Now he "reads" fortunes from the embedded cards, and traders say if Morrow warns you to turn back, **you turn back**.

#### Personality
- **Fatalistic gambler** - treats every decision like a card game, always betting against himself
- **Superstitious to a fault** - refuses to enter buildings with even numbers, won't fight on Tuesdays
- **Darkly humorous** - jokes about his own death constantly ("I'm on borrowed luck. Interest is compounding.")
- **Protects convoys obsessively** - will sacrifice himself to save traders, trying to "pay back" the forty he lost

#### Unique Casket Abilities

**The Tumbledown** is a scrapyard nightmare - asymmetrical, wheezing, held together by luck. It has **Improvised Systems**: every turn, roll 1d6 to see what's working today.

**Special Mechanics**:
1. **Lucky Draw** (1 SP, Reaction - once per turn)
   - When you would take damage, flip a coin (or roll 1d6: 1-3 fail, 4-6 succeed)
   - **Success**: Negate all damage (the shot missed by sheer luck)
   - **Failure**: Take double damage (your luck ran out)
   - *"Three-Card Morrow doesn't dodge. Fate does it for him."*

2. **Scavenger's Gambit** (2 SP, Action)
   - Search the battlefield for improvised weapons/tools
   - Roll 1d6:
     - **1-2**: Find nothing (wasted action)
     - **3-4**: Find scrap (draw 1 card)
     - **5**: Find equipment (draw 2 cards, add to deck)
     - **6**: Find Soulstone shard (heal 3 HP, gain 1 Taint)
   - *"One man's trash is another man's artillery."*

3. **All-In** (4 SP, Attack - Range 1-6)
   - Declare "All-In" and discard your entire hand
   - Deal damage equal to **cards discarded Ã— 2**
   - After attack resolves, Morrow's Casket shuts down for 1 turn (cannot spend SP)
   - *"You either win big or lose everything. That's the game."*

#### Combat Behavior (AI Deck Pattern)
- **Highly unpredictable** - AI rolls 1d6 each turn to determine behavior:
  - 1-2: Defensive (retreats, uses Lucky Draw)
  - 3-4: Standard attack (normal combat)
  - 5-6: Reckless (uses All-In, charges into danger)
- **Protects allies obsessively** - will block shots meant for NPCs/convoys
- **Fights dirty** - uses terrain, improvised explosives, ambush tactics

#### Story Hooks
- Morrow knows the location of the **Dead Convoy** - twelve wrecked rigs with Soulstones still intact, but cursed
- He's being hunted by the **Church Inquisition** for "blasphemous gambling" (his luck defies their doctrine)
- Players can hire him as a guide through the Wastes, but his superstitions may clash with mission parameters
- His embedded cards sometimes show visions of **other players' deaths** - do they believe him?

## 7. Proctor Ilyara Voss (Merchant Guilds)
### "The Actuary of Ash"

**Faction**: Merchant Guilds
**Casket Type**: Heavy - "The Ledger" (1,400 lbs, reinforced vault-class)
**Taint Level**: 2 (Controlled via quarterly "cleansing" fees paid to Church)

#### Physical Description
Ilyara Voss looks like she stepped out of a corporate boardroom and into Hell. She wears a **pristine business suit** under her pilot harness, complete with gold cufflinks and a silk tie. Her hair is pulled back into a severe bun, graying at the temples but still immaculately groomed.

What betrays her humanity is the **mechanical jaw** - half her face was blown off in a "hostile acquisition," and the Guild replaced it with a hinged steel prosthetic. It clicks audibly when she speaks, giving her voice a metallic rasp. She never smiles. Physically cannot.

Her left hand is covered in **contract scars** - ritual cuts where blood oaths were sealed. Each scar represents a deal worth over 100,000 Soulstone shards. She has 14.

The Ledger is not a Casket built for war - it's a **mobile vault**. Reinforced plating, no offensive weapons, but equipped with a communication suite that can call in **Guild mercenaries, orbital artillery, and legal injunctions** from up to 50 miles away.

#### Backstory
Ilyara Voss was born into the Merchant Guilds as a **debt collector** - the kind sent to settlements that defaulted on loans. Her job was simple: extract payment or extract assets. She was very good at it.

Her rise to Proctor (executive rank) came during the **Scorched Sky Auction** - a bidding war over the rights to an entire region's Soulstone deposits. Ilyara realized both bidders were fronts for the same faction and exposed the scheme, bankrupting both and claiming the deposits for the Guild. She was promoted. Her rivals were liquidated.

She pilots The Ledger not for glory, but **to protect Guild interests**. Every mission is a business transaction. Every casualty is a line item. She's responsible for the **Ashen Credit System** - a wartime economy where settlements can borrow Soulstones at 40% interest. Can't pay? Your survivors become indentured labor.

She's the most hated woman in three provinces. She's also the richest.

#### Personality
- **Cold and transactional** - views every interaction as a negotiation
- **Obsessed with contracts** - will not break a deal, even if it costs her life (reputation is currency)
- **Openly mercenary** - doesn't pretend to care about morality ("I sell you hope. You buy it. We both profit.")
- **Surprisingly honorable** - if you fulfill your contract, she will too (even if it hurts the Guild)

#### Unique Casket Abilities

**The Ledger** is not built to fight - it's built to **survive and negotiate**. Its primary weapon is economics.

**Special Mechanics**:
1. **Hostile Buyout** (3 SP, Action - once per battle)
   - Target an enemy Casket within Range 4
   - Offer a contract: "Stand down for 3 turns, receive 1 Soulstone + 1 Equipment card"
   - Enemy pilot rolls Willpower check (TN 5+ on 1d6):
     - **Fail**: They accept the deal and cannot attack for 3 turns
     - **Pass**: They refuse, and Voss gains +2 SP next turn (insulted by rejection)
   - *"Everyone has a price. Even you."*

2. **Call in Debt** (4 SP, Interrupt - Range 8)
   - Voss contacts Guild HQ and calls in a favor
   - Roll 1d6:
     - **1-2**: Artillery strike on target hex (4 damage, ignores armor)
     - **3-4**: Medical evac (heal 3 HP, draw 3 cards)
     - **5-6**: Mercenary reinforcement (spawn 1 Support Unit ally)
   - Can only be used **once per mission**
   - *"I own people. Useful people."*

3. **Foreclosure** (Passive)
   - If an enemy Casket is reduced to **5 HP or less**, Voss may offer a **surrender contract**
   - Terms: Pilot surrenders Casket and equipment, walks away alive
   - If accepted, Voss gains +1 Equipment card permanently (salvaged from wreck)
   - If refused, Voss's next attack deals +3 damage (breach of negotiation)
   - *"Bankruptcy is just death by another name."*

#### Combat Behavior (AI Deck Pattern)
- **Avoids direct combat** - prefers to negotiate, bribe, or call in reinforcements
- **Focuses on high-value targets** - attacks pilots with rare equipment or valuable Caskets
- **Retreats at 50% HP** - survival is profit, death is loss (bad for quarterly reports)
- **Offers surrender frequently** - views killing as "wasting potential assets"

#### Story Hooks
- Voss holds the debt contracts for **half the settlements in the region** - players may owe her money
- She's being targeted by a Nomad assassin whose family was sold into Guild labor
- Players can hire her mercenaries... but the interest rate is predatory
- She knows the location of **The Vault of Ledgers** - a Guild archive with every contract ever signed (leverage on everyone)

## 8. "Woundwright" Tallis (Blighted Packs)
### "The Stitcher"

**Faction**: Blighted Packs
**Casket Type**: Assault - "The Abattoir" (1,200 lbs, biomechanical horror)
**Taint Level**: 12 (Permanent Mutation - no longer measures on standard scale)

#### Physical Description
Tallis is no longer entirely human. His body is a patchwork of **grafted animal parts** - fur, scales, chitin, feathers - all stitched together with surgical precision. His left arm is a wolf's forelimb, complete with claws. His right eye is that of an eagle, golden and unblinking. His legs are those of a deer - digitigrade, allowing him to run at inhuman speeds.

Most disturbing is his torso: he's **sewn shut** with thick black thread, as if his entire body is a quilt of stolen flesh. When he moves, the stitches creak and sometimes tear, leaking black ichor.

His face is still mostly human, but his mouth is too wide - split at the corners like a Glasgow smile, revealing too many teeth. He wears a **leather apron** covered in surgical tools, blood stains, and vials of mutagenic serum.

The Abattoir is a biomechanical Casket - half machine, half living tissue. It **breathes**. Observers report it has a heartbeat.

#### Backstory
Tallis was a **field medic** for the Church, stationed in the Blighted Wastes when a Void rift tore open. The entire garrison was exposed to raw mutation energy. Most died. Some transformed. Tallis was one of the few who stayed *conscious* during the change.

As his body mutated, he realized he could **control the process** - directing where fur grew, which limbs elongated, what organs shifted. He became the first **Woundwright** - a surgeon who grafts Blighted mutations onto others, creating hybrid soldiers.

He left the Church and joined the Blighted Packs, offering his services to those desperate enough to trade humanity for power. He's created abominations. He's also saved lives by grafting resistant tissue onto radiation-scarred patients.

His philosophy: **"The body is just meat. Meat can be rewritten."**

#### Personality
- **Clinically detached** - treats mutilation like art, shows no emotion during surgery
- **Obsessed with "improvement"** - views baseline humanity as "unfinished" (needs more teeth, more eyes, more claws)
- **Polite and soft-spoken** - despite his appearance, he's disarmingly courteous ("May I borrow your arm? I need the bones.")
- **Fascinated by Caskets** - sees them as "metal bodies" that can also be "improved"

#### Unique Casket Abilities

**The Abattoir** is a living workshop - it can **graft mutations onto itself mid-battle**, adapting to threats.

**Special Mechanics**:
1. **Battlefield Surgery** (3 SP, Action)
   - Target self or ally within Range 1
   - **If self**: Graft a mutation (choose one):
     - **Claws**: +1 damage on melee attacks (this mission only)
     - **Scales**: +1 Defense (this mission only)
     - **Extra Eyes**: Ignore facing penalties (this mission only)
   - **If ally**: Heal 2 HP, but target gains 1 Taint (mutation side effect)
   - *"Hold still. This won't hurt. Much."*

2. **Harvest Tissue** (2 SP, Reaction - when enemy is destroyed)
   - Salvage biomass from destroyed enemy Casket
   - Gain 1 **Mutation Token** (max 3)
   - Spend tokens to activate Battlefield Surgery for free (1 token per use)
   - *"Waste not."*

3. **The Stitcher's Gift** (5 SP, Ultimate - once per mission)
   - Tallis ejects from The Abattoir and **physically grafts himself onto an ally's Casket**
   - For the next 3 turns:
     - Ally gains +2 SP per turn
     - Ally's attacks deal +2 damage
     - Ally gains 2 Taint per turn (Tallis's mutations are infectious)
   - After 3 turns, Tallis detaches (Abattoir is remotely piloted back to him)
   - *"Let me show you what you could become."*

#### Combat Behavior (AI Deck Pattern)
- **Focuses on wounded enemies** - prefers to harvest tissue from near-death targets
- **Allies with other Blighted units** - uses Battlefield Surgery to buff allies
- **Adapts mid-combat** - changes mutations based on enemy tactics (claws vs melee, scales vs ranged)
- **Retreats at 25% HP** - only to graft emergency mutations, then re-engages

#### Story Hooks
- Players may need Tallis's surgery to remove a **cursed mutation** or graft resistant tissue
- The Church wants him dead for "crimes against nature" - players could be hired as assassins OR bodyguards
- Tallis is searching for **The First Blighted** - the original patient zero of the mutation plague, rumored to still be alive
- He offers to "improve" player Caskets with bio-enhancements... but the side effects are permanent
