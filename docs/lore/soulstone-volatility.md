# Soulstone Volatility: The Price of Power

> *"The first refiners thought soulstones were just crystals. Then one screamed back. Then one exploded. Then we learned to be afraid."*
> — Master Refiner Kael, Ossuarium Safety Protocols Manual

## The Fundamental Danger

**Soulstones are not inert minerals.** They are **imprisoned consciousness trapped in crystalline form**, constantly struggling against the Void-warped lattice that binds them. Every soulstone is a volatile pressure vessel containing raw bioelectric energy, Void contamination, and the tortured psychic emissions of a trapped soul.

**The horror is simple:** You are not handling a battery. You are handling a **screaming bomb**.

---

## Why Soulstones Are Volatile

### 1. Contained Consciousness Fights Imprisonment

The trapped soul does not accept its fate passively. At a subconscious level, the bound consciousness **constantly attempts to escape**, creating electromagnetic fluctuations within the crystal lattice. This resistance generates:

- **Psychic pressure** (measurable as electromagnetic flux)
- **Structural stress** (visible as hairline fractures in poorly-maintained stones)
- **Energy spikes** (sudden output surges, especially during refinement)

### 2. Void Contamination Destabilizes Matter

All soulstones form through exposure to **Void energy**—the extradimensional radiation that allows souls to crystallize in the first place. This Void contamination makes soulstones fundamentally **unstable in baseline reality**:

- **Phase instability**: Soulstones exist partially "outside" normal space
- **Reality friction**: Contact with normal matter generates heat/energy discharge
- **Spontaneous fragmentation**: High-Taint stones can shatter without warning

### 3. Refinement = Forced Soul Cannibalism

During refinement, a smaller soulstone (containing soul fragments) is **crushed and fed** to a larger Core soul. This is not a gentle process. The Core soul:

1. **Resists absorption** (defensive reaction to forced merger)
2. **Screams psychically** (electromagnetic burst audible through electronics)
3. **Releases energy spikes** (20-40% power surge during integration)

If this process is **mismanaged**, the energy discharge can:
- **Overload containment** (crystal shatters)
- **Ignite volatile materials** (fuel, ammunition, flesh)
- **Trigger cascade failures** (nearby soulstones resonate and destabilize)

## Refinement Disasters: What Goes Wrong

### The Three Categories of Failure

| Disaster Type | Cause | Consequence | Frequency |
|---------------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Explosive Overload** | Energy discharge exceeds containment capacity | Shard detonates (3-hex radius, 2d6 damage) | 5-10% (amateur), 0.5% (expert) |
| **Corruption Cascade** | Void contamination spreads from unstable stone | Taint spikes in area, nearby souls infected | 2-4% (amateur), 0.2% (expert) |
| **Psychic Backlash** | Core soul rejects fragment violently | Refiner suffers neural damage (Thread Snap, sanity loss) | 8-15% (amateur), 1% (expert) |

### Historical Disasters

#### The Forge-Maw Incident (Year 12)
**Location:** Dwarven Forge-Guilds, Deepforge Refinery
**Cause:** Apprentice attempted to refine **3 T2 Fragments simultaneously** (standard protocol: one at a time)
**Result:**
- Cascade detonation destroyed entire refinery wing (14 dead)
- Void contamination rendered the area uninhabitable for 6 months
- All soulstones within 30 meters **shattered simultaneously** (Sympathetic Echo)
- Surviving workers reported "hearing hundreds of voices screaming in unison"

**Lesson Learned:** Refinement must **never be rushed**. One shard at a time. Always.

#### The Scream of Ashfields (Year 8)
**Location:** Nomad salvage camp, contested territory
**Cause:** Untrained scavenger attempted field refinement without proper shielding
**Result:**
- Psychic backlash transmitted through neural threads
- Refiner's brain suffered catastrophic neural damage (permanent vegetative state)
- Core soul "woke up" during process, seized control of Casket
- Casket rampaged for 2 hours before self-destructing (8 casualties)

**Lesson Learned:** Field refinement is **desperately dangerous**. Proper shielding is not optional.

#### The Exchange Vault Fire (Year 15)
**Location:** Exchange central repository, merchant district
**Cause:** Poorly-maintained T3 Crystal stored near combustible trade goods
**Result:**
- Crystal spontaneously fractured (age + Taint accumulation)
- Energy discharge ignited surrounding materials
- Fire spread to soulstone storage vault (400+ Shards)
- Chain reaction of detonations leveled 3 city blocks (200+ dead)

**Lesson Learned:** Soulstone storage requires **constant monitoring**. Old stones are ticking time bombs.

## Why Standard Methods Fail

### "Just Crush It and Move On" (Nomad Approach)
**What It Looks Like:**
- No containment chamber
- No energy shielding
- Manual crushing (hammer/rock/Casket hand)
- Minimal time investment

**Why It Fails:**
- **No dampening**: Energy discharge is uncontrolled
- **No isolation**: Void contamination spreads to refiner
- **No preparation**: Soul resistance is maximum (unprepared Core)

**Failure Rate:** 15-20%
**Consequence:** Burns, Taint spikes, crystal shrapnel injuries, occasional death

### "Fast Batch Processing" (Early Ossuarium Experiments)
**What It Looked Like:**
- Multiple Shards refined simultaneously to save time
- Industrial-scale chambers with high throughput
- Minimal monitoring per individual refinement

**Why It Failed:**
- **Sympathetic Echo**: Multiple souls screamed at once, amplifying each other
- **Cascade overload**: One failure triggered chain reaction
- **Taint accumulation**: Concentrated Void energy overwhelmed containment

**Failure Rate:** 8-12% (catastrophic when it failed)
**Outcome:** Protocol **permanently banned** after Deepforge Incident (Year 12)

---

## Extreme Measures Required: Safe Refinement Protocols

### Ossuarium Standard Protocol (87% Success Rate)

#### Equipment Required:
- **Reinforced containment chamber** (6-inch bone-steel walls)
- **Void dampening field** (suppresses energy spikes)
- **Psychic shielding** (blocks neural backlash)
- **Emergency venting system** (redirects explosive discharge)

#### Procedure (2-5 Days Per Shard):
1. **Soul Preparation (Day 1):** Core soul is "calmed" via electromagnetic lullaby (reduces resistance)
2. **Shard Inspection (Day 1):** Fragment examined for cracks, Taint levels, structural integrity
3. **Isolation (Day 2):** Chamber sealed, Void dampening activated
4. **Controlled Crushing (Day 2):** Mechanical press applies gradual pressure over 6 hours
5. **Essence Extraction (Day 2-3):** Soul essence liquefies, drained into containment flask
6. **Feeding (Day 3-4):** Essence injected slowly into Core (1ml per hour maximum)
7. **Integration Monitoring (Day 4-5):** Core soul observed for rejection signs, stabilization confirmed

**Cost:** 40 Credits per refinement (equipment, time, expertise)
**Failure Rate:** 0.5%

### Church of Absolution Ritual Method (60% Success Rate)

#### Equipment Required:
- **Consecrated refinement altar** (blessed bone-steel)
- **Prayer focus** (trained clergy maintain chant during process)
- **Holy shielding** (sacred oils suppress Void contamination)

#### Procedure (3-7 Days Per Shard):
1. **Confession (Day 1-2):** Core soul "confesses" sins via radio transmission (psychologically prepares soul for integration)
2. **Fragment Consecration (Day 3):** Shard blessed, cleansed of "impurities"
3. **Ritual Crushing (Day 4):** Shard crushed during prayer ceremony (8-hour service)
4. **Sanctified Feeding (Day 5-6):** Essence mixed with holy water, poured slowly into Core
5. **Penance Vigil (Day 7):** Clergy monitor Core soul, intervene if rejection occurs

**Cost:** 20 Credits (prayer time) + risk of divine "disapproval" (random events)
**Failure Rate:** 2-3% (higher than Ossuarium, but emphasizes soul "consent")

### Dwarven Forge-Guild Method (65% Success Rate)

#### Equipment Required:
- **Runic containment circle** (carved into stone floor)
- **Geometric precision press** (hydraulic crusher with micrometer control)
- **Stabilization runes** (etched into Core socket)

#### Procedure (1-3 Days Per Shard):
1. **Structural Analysis (Day 1):** Shard measured, flaws catalogued, optimal crush angle calculated
2. **Rune Activation (Day 1):** Containment circle powered, forms electromagnetic cage
3. **Precision Crushing (Day 2):** Shard crushed along calculated fracture planes (minimizes resistance)
4. **Controlled Feeding (Day 2-3):** Essence funneled directly into Core via runic channels

**Cost:** 30 Credits (runesmith time, equipment use)
**Failure Rate:** 1-2% (efficiency-focused, low tolerance for failure)

### The Elven "Mourning Method" (40% Success Rate, Lowest Taint)

#### Equipment Required:
- **Living wood containment** (roots absorb excess Void energy)
- **Natural attunement** (Core soul placed near sacred grove)
- **No mechanical crushing** (fragment allowed to dissolve naturally)

#### Procedure (7-30 Days Per Shard):
1. **Mourning Ritual (Day 1-7):** Both Core and Shard "mourned" by druids (psychological preparation)
2. **Natural Dissolution (Day 8-28):** Shard placed in soil, allowed to liquefy slowly (no force applied)
3. **Willing Absorption (Day 29-30):** Core soul "invited" to accept essence (consensual integration)

**Cost:** 0 Credits (natural process) + massive time investment
**Failure Rate:** 10% (but failures are "gentle"—soul dissipates, no explosion)
**Taint Gain:** -50% (natural method reduces Void contamination)

**Why It's Rarely Used:** Takes 10-30 days per refinement. Most factions can't afford the time.

## Extreme Precautions: Why Every Step Matters

### 1. Containment Chambers Prevent Explosions

**Without Containment:**
- Energy discharge is uncontrolled (3-6 hex blast radius)
- Shrapnel scatters (crystal fragments pierce flesh/armor)
- Void contamination spreads (area becomes hazardous)

**With Containment:**
- Reinforced walls absorb shock
- Venting channels redirect discharge safely
- Shielding prevents Taint spread

**The Math:** A T2 Fragment contains ~15 Energy. During refinement, 20-40% discharges as waste heat/force. That's **3-6 Energy worth of explosive force** (equivalent to 2d6 damage in 3-hex radius). Containment redirects this energy **away from the refiner**.

### 2. Psychic Shielding Prevents Neural Damage

**Without Shielding:**
- Core soul's scream transmits through electromagnetic field
- Refiner's neural threads act as "antennas" (if installed)
- Brain suffers electrical overload (Thread Snap, seizures, permanent damage)

**With Shielding:**
- Electromagnetic dampening blocks psychic transmission
- Core soul still screams (it's trapped), but refiner doesn't "hear" it
- Neural threads remain stable

**The Horror:** Refiners report that **unshielded refinement feels like someone screaming inside your skull**. Extended exposure causes permanent psychological damage.

### 3. Slow Integration Reduces Rejection

**Fast Feeding (1 hour):**
- Core soul has no time to adapt
- Defensive reactions are violent (energy spikes, rejection)
- Failure rate: 15-25%

**Slow Feeding (24-48 hours):**
- Core soul "accepts" new fragments gradually
- Energy spikes are manageable
- Failure rate: 0.5-2%

**Analogy:** Imagine force-feeding someone an entire meal in 30 seconds vs. letting them eat slowly over hours. The body (or soul) needs time to process.

## Field Refinement: The Desperate Gamble

### Why Pilots Risk It

**Scenario:** Casket energy is critical (< 20/100). Mission is not over. Pilot has Shards in inventory. Options:
1. **Retreat** (abandon mission, lose credits/reputation)
2. **Continue** (risk shutdown, death)
3. **Field refine** (emergency recharge, massive risk)

Most pilots choose #3.

### The Reality of Field Refinement

**Equipment Available:**
- No containment chamber (middle of battlefield)
- No psychic shielding (pilot is strapped inside Casket)
- No slow feeding (needs to be done in 1 turn = ~30 seconds)
- Manual crushing (pilot uses hands/rock/Casket's own fist)

**The Process:**
1. Pilot retrieves Shard from storage pouch
2. Reaches behind, places Shard against Core socket
3. **Smashes the crystal** (brutal, desperate)
4. Fragments spray soul essence directly onto Core
5. Core screams (pilot hears it through neural threads)
6. Energy surge courses through Casket systems

**Risk Table (Roll 1d6):**

| Roll | Result | Consequence |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **1-3** | Success | Energy restored, normal Taint gain |
| **4-5** | Partial Overload | Energy restored, **+2x Taint** (double corruption) |
| **6** | Critical Overload | Energy restored, **+3x Taint**, **immediate Thread Snap** (neural feedback), **1d6 damage** to pilot (crystal shrapnel) |

**Narrative Horror:**
- Crystal shards pierce pilot's gloves (blood mixes with soul essence)
- Core soul screams **so loudly** nearby pilots hear it through closed caskets
- Pilot's hands burn (Void energy discharge)
- Neural threads feel "on fire" (psychic backlash)
- Other players witness smoke/sparks venting from Casket

**Why Pilots Do It Anyway:** Because the alternative is **casket shutdown mid-combat** (certain death).

## Taint Accumulation: The Hidden Cost

### Every Refinement Adds Corruption

Refinement is **never clean**. Even with perfect protocols, Void energy seeps through:

| Refinement Method | Base Taint Gain | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Ossuarium Standard** | +1 per T1, +2 per T2, +5 per T3 | Controlled, but still corrupting |
| **Church Ritual** | +1 per T1, +2 per T2, +5 per T3 | Prayer doesn't reduce Taint (it comforts souls, not Void) |
| **Dwarven Precision** | +1 per T1, +2 per T2, +5 per T3 | Efficiency doesn't reduce corruption |
| **Elven Natural** | **+0.5 per T1, +1 per T2, +2.5 per T3** | Only method that reduces Taint (but takes weeks) |
| **Field Refinement (Success)** | +2 per T1, +4 per T2, +10 per T3 | **Double Taint** (no containment) |
| **Field Refinement (Overload)** | +3-6 per T1, +6-12 per T2, +15-30 per T3 | **Triple Taint** (catastrophic) |

### Taint Accumulation = Casket Instability

High Taint leads to:
- **Void Corruption Events** (Taint 21+): Roll 1d6 per mission
  - **1-2:** The Whispers (Core begs for more fragments)
  - **3-4:** Thread Rebellion (equipment malfunctions)
  - **5:** Soul Fragmentation (disadvantage on attacks)
  - **6:** **Void Breach** (Core takes control, Casket goes rogue)

**The Trap:** You need refinement to keep fighting. But refinement accumulates Taint. High Taint makes your Casket unstable. Instability can kill you. **There is no escape from this cycle.**

## Why "Normal Means" End in Disaster

### The Illusion of Safety

**Common Mistakes:**
1. **"It's just a rock"** → Treating soulstones like inert minerals
2. **"We're in a hurry"** → Rushing refinement to save time
3. **"We don't have proper equipment"** → Improvising with inadequate tools
4. **"We've done this before"** → Overconfidence from past successes
5. **"This one looks fine"** → Skipping inspection of high-Taint stones

**Each of these has killed refiners.**

### The Math of Disaster

**Amateur Refinement (No Protocol):**
- Failure rate: **15-20%**
- 100 refinements = **15-20 disasters**
- Each disaster = death, injury, or equipment destruction

**Professional Refinement (Full Protocol):**
- Failure rate: **0.5-2%**
- 100 refinements = **0.5-2 disasters** (manageable)

**The Difference:** Protocols reduce failure rate by **90%**. But they require:
- Expensive equipment (500-2,000 Credits initial investment)
- Trained personnel (2-5 years training)
- Time investment (1-7 days per refinement)

**Most factions can't afford this.** So they cut corners. And people die.

## Faction-Specific Disasters

### Nomad Collective: "The Scavenger's Curse"

**Common Practice:**
- No containment chambers (too expensive to haul)
- Field refinement is standard (not emergency measure)
- Equipment is improvised (hammers, rocks, Casket fists)

**Disaster Rate:** 15-20% of refinements fail
**Annual Casualties:** 200-400 dead from refinement accidents
**Nickname:** "Blood price for fuel"

**Why They Accept It:** Nomads are desperate. Proper refinement costs 30-40 Credits + days of downtime. They don't have either. So they gamble. And lose.

### The Exchange: "Profit Over Safety"

**Common Practice:**
- Buy Shards from questionable sources (high Taint, poor maintenance)
- Store large quantities in dense urban areas (fire risk)
- Hire untrained staff (cheap labor)

**Disaster Rate:** 5-8% (moderate, but high consequences)
**Worst Incident:** Vault Fire (Year 15), 200+ dead, 3 city blocks destroyed
**Response:** Increased insurance premiums, minimal safety improvements

**Why They Accept It:** Safety costs money. Dead customers don't sue. Math checks out.

### Church of Absolution: "Divine Protection Fallacy"

**Common Practice:**
- Belief that prayer protects from disasters
- Reduced physical safeguards (reliance on faith)
- Untrained clergy performing refinement (priesthood, not engineers)

**Disaster Rate:** 2-3% (better than amateurs, worse than experts)
**Failure Mode:** "God's will" justification for deaths
**Reality:** Prayer comforts souls, but doesn't prevent explosions

**Why They Accept It:** Faith is non-negotiable. Safety protocols are seen as "lack of trust in divine protection."

---

## The Unspoken Truth

**Every Casket pilot relies on soulstone refinement.** Without it, Caskets run out of power and die. But refinement is **inherently dangerous**. Even with perfect protocols, there is risk. The Void does not forgive mistakes.

**The horror is systemic:** Civilization runs on trapped souls. Those souls must be fed. Feeding them is dangerous. But if you stop feeding them, everything collapses.

**You cannot opt out.** You can only manage the risk.

And sometimes, the risk kills you anyway.

## Designer Notes

**For GMs:**
- Use refinement disasters as **campaign tension points**
- Roll secretly for players using field refinement (surprise them with failures)
- Describe failures **viscerally** (screaming, explosions, blood, Taint)
- Make safe refinement **expensive** (forces tough resource choices)

**For Players:**
- Field refinement is **gambling with your life**
- High Taint = ticking time bomb (manage it proactively)
- Cheap refinement = high risk (you get what you pay for)
- Elven method is safest but slowest (trade-off)

**Narrative Goal:**
Every time a player refines a soulstone, they should **feel the weight** of what they're doing. This isn't clicking "Recharge Battery" in a video game menu. This is **crushing a screaming soul and feeding it to another screaming soul** while gambling that the process doesn't explode in your face.

Make it horrible. Make it dangerous. Make it **necessary**.

Because that's what it is.
