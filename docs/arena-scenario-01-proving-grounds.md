### 4 Phases Per Turn

#### PHASE 1: REFRESH
1. Restore SP to maximum
   - Church: 5 SP (Medium Frame)
   - Dwarves: 5 SP (Medium Frame)
2. If Heat 5+: Roll Strain (1d6 + current Heat)

- Move (1 SP per hex, 2 SP for difficult terrain)
- Continue until out of SP or pass turn

#### PHASE 3: DRAW PHASE
1. Draw cards until hand size = 6
2. If deck is empty:
   - Shuffle discard pile
   - Add 1 "Damage" card (blank, dead draw)
   - This is your new deck

#### PHASE 4: END TURN
- Resolve end-of-turn effects
- Remove temporary buffs (e.g., Shield Wall)
- Opponent begins their turn

---

## COMBAT RESOLUTION

### Attack Steps
1. **Declare attack**: Play attack card, spend SP
2. **Check range**: Is target in range?
   - Melee: 1 hex
   - Close: 2-3 hexes
   - Medium: 4-6 hexes
   - Long: 7+ hexes
3. **Check LOS**: Can you see target? (forest blocks LOS)
4. **Calculate damage**:
   - Base damage (from card)
   - + Facing modifier (Rear +2, Side +1, Front +0)
   - + Elevation modifier (E1 +1, E2 +2)
   - - Defense modifiers (cover, buffs)
5. **Apply damage**: Defender discards X cards from top of deck

### Damage Example
Church plays **Faithful Thrust** (4 damage, Melee) against Dwarven Casket:
- Church is attacking from **Rear arc**: +2 damage
- Church is on **Elevation 1**: +1 damage
- Dwarf has **1 Rune Counter**: -1 damage
- Total: 4 + 2 + 1 - 1 = **6 damage**
- Dwarf discards top 6 cards from deck

### Component Damage
When you discard cards from damage:
1. Count how many **Primary Weapon cards** were discarded
2. Each Primary Weapon card = 1 **Component Damage**
3. Track Component Damage by location:
   - Arms (weapon systems)
   - Legs (movement systems)
   - Head (sensors)
   - Chassis (core systems)
4. When **3 Component Damage** to same location = **Component Destroyed**

#### Component Destruction Effects
- **Right Arm Destroyed**: Lose all Primary Weapon cards from hand (discard them)
- **Left Arm Destroyed**: Lose all Secondary Equipment cards from hand
- **Legs Destroyed**: Movement costs +1 SP per hex
- **Head Destroyed**: -1 damage to ranged attacks, no sensor abilities
- **Chassis Destroyed**: -1 SP maximum permanently

---

## VICTORY CONDITIONS

### Primary Victory: Reduce Opponent to 0 HP
When opponent's deck is empty AND they cannot reshuffle (discard pile also empty), they are defeated.

### Secondary Victory: Death Spiral (4+ Reshuffles)
After 4 reshuffles, opponent's deck contains:
- 26 real cards
- 4 Damage cards (13% of deck is dead draws)

At this point, most players concede. You can declare victory if opponent agrees.

### Tertiary Victory: Concession
Either player may concede at any time.

## SCENARIO OBJECTIVES (Optional Victory Points)

These are OPTIONAL goals for learning/practice. Not required for victory.

### Church Objectives
- [ ] **Aggressive Martyr**: Deal 20+ damage in a single turn using Blood Offering combo
- [ ] **Righteous Fury**: Trigger Righteous Fury (+1 dmg per kill) - destroy 1 component
- [ ] **Faithful Execution**: Kill opponent with Divine Judgment (6-8 dmg execute)

### Dwarven Objectives
- [ ] **Immovable Object**: Survive 5+ turns with 3 Rune Counters active
- [ ] **Armor Piercer**: Deal 15+ damage with armor-piercing attacks in one turn
- [ ] **Forge Eruption**: Use Forge Fury with 5+ Heat (8+ damage total)

---

## SPECIAL RULES FOR THIS SCENARIO

### 1. Simplified Component Damage
For beginner learning, track Component Damage as a **single pool** (not by location).
- 3 Component Damage total = Destroy **1 random component** (roll 1d4: 1=Arms, 2=Legs, 3=Head, 4=Chassis)

Advanced players should track by location.

### 2. No Pilot Wounds (Optional)
For faster learning games, ignore Pilot Wound Decks.
- Casket destruction = immediate defeat
- No capsule breach, no neural feedback

Once comfortable, add Pilot Wounds for full brutality.

### 3. Terrain Interaction Encouraged
The map is designed to teach terrain usage:
- **Forest corners**: Defensive positions (+1 Defense)
- **Central elevation**: High-risk, high-reward positioning (+2 dmg)
- **Water/Mud ring**: Heat management and mobility challenge
- **Rubble lines**: Cover without mobility penalty

Players should experiment with terrain advantages.

---

## EXPECTED GAME FLOW

### Turns 1-3: Positioning
- Both players navigate terrain toward center
- Church moves faster (Desperate Lunge, Overextend)
- Dwarves set up defensive buffs (Rune of Protection)
- Minimal damage, mostly movement and setup

### Turns 4-6: First Engagement
- Church closes to Melee range
- Dwarves activate Shield Wall
- First attacks land (4-6 damage each)
- Heat begins building (especially Dwarves)
- First Component Damage tracked

### Turns 7-10: Brutal Exchange
- Both sides trading heavy blows
- Church using Blood Offering for burst (discard 2 cards for +3 dmg)
- Dwarves stacking Rune Counters (reducing damage)
- First reshuffle likely (add 1 Damage card)
- Heat Strain checks begin (5+ Heat)

### Turns 11-15: Death Spiral
- Decks contain Damage cards (dead draws)
- Component destruction occurs (3+ Component Damage)
- Players desperate, using ultimate cards (Hammerfall, Divine Judgment)
- One side collapses

### Expected Winner
**51/49 Church favor** - slightly more aggressive, can burst down Dwarves before attrition matters.

However, if Dwarves survive to Turn 12+, attrition favors them (32 HP vs 30 HP).

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

This scenario teaches:
1. **SP economy**: When to spend, when to save
2. **Heat management**: Risk/reward of high-Heat cards
3. **Deck cycling**: When to reshuffle, when to delay
4. **Component damage**: Tracking and destruction effects
5. **Facing modifiers**: Importance of positioning (rear arc +2 dmg)
6. **Terrain usage**: Cover, elevation, difficult terrain
7. **Reactive cards**: 0 SP interrupts (Brace for Impact, Unbreakable)
8. **Death spiral**: How Damage cards accumulate

After playing this scenario 2-3 times, players should understand all core mechanics.

---

## POST-GAME DEBRIEF

### Questions to Consider
1. When did you feel most powerful? Most vulnerable?
2. How many reshuffles occurred? (Track Damage card accumulation)
3. Did Component Destruction happen? Which component?
4. How did terrain affect positioning choices?
5. Did Heat Strain matter? (5+ Heat rolls)
6. Which cards felt most/least useful?

### Balance Observations
- Did armor-piercing (Dwarven Crushing Blow) feel oppressive?
- Did Church's burst damage (Blood Offering) feel fair?
- Did 32 HP (Stone Endurance) make Dwarves too tanky?
- Did Reactive cards (0 SP) disrupt gameplay positively or negatively?

### Suggested Variations
- **Swap Tactics**: Try different Tactic combinations
- **Swap Secondary**: Church uses Tower Shield, Dwarves use Siege Cannon
- **Full Pilot Wounds**: Add Pilot Wound Decks for maximum brutality
- **Component Tracking**: Track Component Damage by specific location

## MAP STRATEGY GUIDE

### For Church (Aggressive Striker)
1. **Opening**: Deploy in Forest hex (top-left) for initial cover
2. **Turn 1-2**: Rush toward center elevation using Desperate Lunge + Overextend
3. **Turn 3**: Reach Elevation 1 (E1), use Quick Shot to harass
4. **Turn 4+**: Close to Melee, attack from elevated rear arc (4 base + 2 rear + 1 elevation = 7 dmg)
5. **Heat**: Use Water hexes to cool down if overheating
6. **Win**: Burst damage from favorable position before Dwarves stabilize

**Key Hexes**: Elevation 1 (center ring), Forest corners (fallback)

### For Dwarves (Defensive Anchor)
1. **Opening**: Deploy in Rubble hex (bottom-right) for +1 Defense
2. **Turn 1-2**: Advance slowly, play Rune of Protection (stack counters)
3. **Turn 3**: Activate Shield Wall, position near Water (Heat management)
4. **Turn 4+**: Let Church come to you, counter-attack with Crushing Blow
5. **Heat**: High Heat generation, use Water hexes frequently
6. **Win**: Outlast Church through superior HP and damage reduction

**Key Hexes**: Rubble (defensive positions), Water (Heat cooling), Elevation 2 (if safe)
