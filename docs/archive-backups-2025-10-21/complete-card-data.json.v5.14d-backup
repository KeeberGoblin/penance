    "description": "Complete Penance card database v5.13 - STRUCTURAL REBALANCE: Moved 6 Church weapons to universal pool (Mace, Greatsword, Warhammer, Halberd, Chain Whip, Flail = 37 cards). Church now has 19 faction-specific cards (Tower Shield, Blessed Talisman, Codex of Light, Divine Scepter) matching other factions. This addresses the root cause: Church had 56 cards vs 13-18 for others, creating 3-4× card pool advantage. All factions now have equal access to heavy weapons.",
