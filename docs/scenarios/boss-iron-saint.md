Version: 1.0
Last Updated: October 10, 2025

---

## Overview

The Iron Saint is a playable boss encounter designed for 2-4 players. Like Kingdom Death: Monster, this fight uses an HP deck system where the boss gets more dangerous as it takes damage, adding new ability cards at specific thresholds.

**Recommended Player Level**: Pilots with 3+ missions completed
**Estimated Duration**: 60-90 minutes
**Difficulty**: BRUTAL

---

## Lore

Sister Vex was once a devout believer. Now she is the Church's most terrifying instrument. Taint Level 7. Pilots "The Confessional" - a 1,600lb heavy Casket dripping with scripture and scars. She believes suffering purifies. Every wound brings salvation closer. She will show you the path to redemption. You will beg for damnation instead.

## Design Notes (For Game Master)

### Why This Works Like Kingdom Death

1. **HP Deck = Dynamic Fight**: Boss doesn't just lose health, she changes strategy
2. **Phase Escalation**: Each phase adds difficulty cards, increasing pressure
3. **Risk/Reward**: Players must balance speed (kill before Phase 4) vs safety (avoid Taint)
4. **False Defeat**: "Absolution Denied" creates dramatic final stand moment
5. **Minion Summons**: Forces target prioritization like KDM
6. **Corruption Mechanic**: Taint acts like KDM's insanity/disorders - long-term consequence

### Playtesting Notes

- First playtest: Adjust card counts based on player damage output
- If fight ends before Phase 3: Add +5 cards to starting deck
- If fight drags past 90 minutes: Reduce starting deck by 5 cards
- Taint accumulation should threaten 1-2 players by Phase 3, not all of them
- Minions should be dangerous but not overwhelming - max 2 on field at once

## Variant: The Twins (4-6 Players)

For larger groups, fight both Sister Vex AND Bonelord Thresh simultaneously.

- Each boss has 30-card deck
- They share a turn (both activate after all players)
- When one dies, the other gains +2 to all damage
- New Phase 4 card for survivor: "Avenge the Fallen" - Attack all enemies for 6d6
