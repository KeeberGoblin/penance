# SCENARIO #5: SABOTAGE MISSION

**Type**: Stealth & Destruction
**Players**: 1 vs 1 (Saboteur vs Defender) or Solo
**Estimated Playtime**: 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert
**Victory Condition**:
- **Saboteur**: Destroy 3 of 5 Reactor Cores OR eliminate the Defender
- **Defender**: Prevent the Saboteur from destroying 3 Reactors for 10 turns OR eliminate the Saboteur

---

## SCENARIO OVERVIEW

A heavily fortified facility houses five unstable Reactor Cores. The Saboteur must sneak in, plant explosives, and escape before the Defender can stop them. The twist? **The Saboteur starts HIDDEN** and can move undetected... until they attack.

**What This Teaches**: Stealth mechanics, asymmetric information, bluffing, area denial, high-stakes decision-making

### Terrain Legend

- **[W] Water/Perimeter**: Impassable terrain (can't enter or see through)
- **[##] Walls**: Impassable, blocks LOS
- **[R1-R5] Reactor Cores**: Objectives (5 total)
- **[EN] Entry Point**: Where the Saboteur enters
- **[  ] Open Floor**: Normal movement (1 SP), no defensive bonus

---

## THE REACTOR CORES (5 Objectives)

### Reactor Locations
- **Reactor 1**: Top-left (hex [2,2])
- **Reactor 2**: Top-right (hex [11,2])
- **Reactor 3**: Center (4-hex cluster, [6,5], [7,5], [6,6], [7,6])
- **Reactor 4**: Bottom-left (hex [2,10])
- **Reactor 5**: Bottom-right (hex [11,10])

### Destroying a Reactor

**Step 1: Plant Explosive** (Costs 3 SP)
- Stand adjacent to a Reactor hex
- Spend 3 SP and discard 1 card to plant an explosive
- Place an "Explosive" token on the Reactor hex

**Step 2: Detonate** (Costs 1 SP, can be done from anywhere)
- On a later turn, spend 1 SP to detonate ALL planted explosives simultaneously
- All Reactors with Explosive tokens are destroyed
- Detonation creates a **Shockwave** (see below)

**Step 3: Escape**
- After detonating, the Saboteur must exit through the Entry Point [6,12] or [7,12]

### Shockwave Effect (When Reactors Detonate)

When explosives detonate:
1. All Caskets within **5 hexes** of ANY destroyed Reactor take **8 damage** (ignore armor)
2. All Caskets are **Stunned** until their next turn (cannot spend SP on their next turn)
3. The facility loses power: **All lights go out** (see Darkness rules)

---

## STEALTH MECHANICS (HIDDEN MOVEMENT)

### The Saboteur Starts Hidden

**Setup**:
- The Saboteur does NOT place their Casket on the map at the start
- Instead, the Saboteur secretly writes down their starting location (must be within 3 hexes of [6,12] or [7,12])
- The Saboteur moves in secret, tracking their position on paper or a hidden map

**Hidden Movement**:
- While hidden, the Saboteur can move normally but does NOT reveal their position
- The Defender cannot attack or see the Saboteur
- The Saboteur can plant explosives while hidden

### Revealing the Saboteur

The Saboteur becomes **Revealed** (place their Casket model on the map) when:
1. The Saboteur **attacks** the Defender
2. The Saboteur **moves within 3 hexes** of the Defender (Defender's sensors detect movement)
3. The Saboteur **detonates explosives** (explosion reveals their position)
4. The Defender **scans** the area and catches the Saboteur (see Scanning)

**Once Revealed**: The Saboteur remains revealed for the rest of the game (normal combat rules apply)

---

## DEFENDER MECHANICS

### Scanning for the Saboteur

**Scan Action** (Costs 4 SP):
- The Defender can spend 4 SP to scan a **5-hex radius area**
- Choose a center hex within 8 hexes of the Defender
- If the Saboteur is within that 5-hex area, they are **Revealed** (place their Casket on the map)
- If the Saboteur is NOT in the area, they remain hidden (wasted SP)

**Sensor Range**:
- The Defender automatically detects the Saboteur if the Saboteur moves within **3 hexes** (no SP cost)

### Patrolling

The Defender starts in the **center of the facility** (hex [7,7]) and must patrol to protect the Reactors.

**Strategic Dilemma**:
- Do you stay near the **Center Reactor** (R3, most valuable) or patrol the corners?
- Do you **scan aggressively** (costs SP) or **move defensively**?

---

## DEPLOYMENT

### Saboteur Deployment (Hidden)
- The Saboteur does NOT place their model on the map
- Secretly write down starting position within 3 hexes of [6,12] or [7,12] (Entry Point)
- Use a hidden map or paper to track movement

### Defender Deployment (Visible)
- Place Defender's Casket on hex [7,7] (center of facility)
- Facing any direction

---

## VICTORY CONDITIONS

### Saboteur Wins If:
1. **3 or more Reactors are destroyed** (detonate explosives on 3+ Reactors) **AND**
2. The Saboteur escapes through the Entry Point [6,12] or [7,12] (after detonation) **OR**
3. The Defender is reduced to 0 HP

### Defender Wins If:
1. The Saboteur is reduced to 0 HP **OR**
2. **Turn 10 ends** and the Saboteur has not destroyed 3+ Reactors (time runs out, Saboteur mission fails)

---

## SPECIAL RULES

### Darkness (After Detonation)

When the first Reactor explodes, the facility loses power:
- **All Caskets have -2 to Attack Dice rolls** (fighting in darkness)
- **LOS is reduced to 6 hexes maximum** (can't see far in the dark)
- **Defender's Scan action costs 6 SP** instead of 4 SP (sensors are damaged)

### Reactor Alarm

If the Defender **sees** the Saboteur planting an explosive (i.e., the Saboteur is Revealed and adjacent to a Reactor):
- The Defender gains **+2 SP immediately** (alarm boosts power systems)
- The Defender can interrupt the Saboteur's turn with a single attack (costs 2 SP)

### Escape Under Fire

If the Saboteur is Revealed and tries to exit through the Entry Point:
- The Defender gets **one free attack** (no SP cost) as the Saboteur flees
- If the Saboteur survives, they escape successfully

---

## TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Saboteur Strategy
- **Stay Hidden**: Avoid the Defender's patrols and scans
- **Plant Multiple Explosives**: Plant on 3+ Reactors BEFORE detonating (simultaneous explosions)
- **Bait the Defender**: Move loudly in one area, then sneak to another
- **Know When to Fight**: If caught, decide: fight the Defender or run?

### Defender Strategy
- **Patrol Efficiently**: Cover multiple Reactors in each patrol route
- **Scan Smart**: Don't waste SP on empty areas, predict where Saboteur will go
- **Protect High-Value Reactors**: Center Reactor (R3) is hardest to defend (4 hexes, multiple angles)
- **Force Reveals**: Stand near choke points to trigger the 3-hex detection

---

## BALANCING NOTES

**If Saboteur Wins Too Easily**:
- Reduce turn limit to Turn 8 (more pressure on Saboteur)
- Increase Defender's scan range to 6 hexes
- Require Saboteur to destroy 4 Reactors instead of 3

**If Defender Wins Too Easily**:
- Increase turn limit to Turn 12 (more time for Saboteur)
- Reduce Defender's scan cost to 3 SP
- Allow Saboteur to plant explosives for 2 SP instead of 3 SP

---

## VARIANTS

### **Variant: Co-Op Mode (Solo Saboteur vs AI Defender)**

The Defender follows a simple AI patrol pattern:
1. **Turn 1-2**: Move to Reactor 1 (top-left), scan 5-hex radius
2. **Turn 3-4**: Move to Reactor 2 (top-right), scan 5-hex radius
3. **Turn 5-6**: Move to Reactor 3 (center), scan 5-hex radius
4. **Turn 7-8**: Move to Reactor 4 (bottom-left), scan 5-hex radius
5. **Turn 9-10**: Move to Reactor 5 (bottom-right), scan 5-hex radius
6. If Saboteur is Revealed, AI moves toward Saboteur and attacks

**Solo Victory**: Destroy 3 Reactors without getting caught by AI patrols

### **Variant: Reversed Roles**

- The **Defender** starts hidden and must survive 10 turns without being found
- The **Saboteur** patrols and scans to find the Defender
- Tests the opposite skill set (Saboteur hunts, Defender hides)

### **Variant: Time Bomb**

- The Saboteur can only detonate explosives on **Turn 7** (exactly)
- Must plant all explosives by Turn 6, then detonate on Turn 7
- Creates predictable timing, increases tension

### **Variant: Multiple Saboteurs**

- 2 Saboteurs vs 1 Defender (2v1 asymmetric)
- Both Saboteurs start hidden separately
- Defender must catch both before Turn 10

---

## RECOMMENDED FACTIONS

**Good Saboteur Choices**:
- **Elven Verdant Covenant**: High mobility, can plant and escape quickly
- **The Ossuarium**: Lifesteal survives shockwave damage
- **Church of Absolution**: Burst damage if caught (can fight way out)

**Good Defender Choices**:
- **Dwarven Forge-Guilds**: Tanky, can patrol aggressively
- **Church of Absolution**: High damage stops Saboteur before escape
- **Elven Verdant Covenant**: Mobile, can patrol multiple areas quickly

---

## DESIGN NOTES

This scenario introduces **hidden information** and **bluffing**. The Saboteur player must think like a stealth game protagonist, while the Defender plays a tense game of cat-and-mouse.

The **Scan action** is expensive but necessary. Defenders must balance aggression (chasing the Saboteur) with information-gathering (scanning for hidden threats).

The **turn limit** creates urgency. Saboteurs can't turtle forever—they must take risks to plant explosives and escape.

**Lesson**: Information is a resource. Sometimes what you DON'T know is more dangerous than what you DO know.
