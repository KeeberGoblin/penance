## TURN 3: ALICE (CHURCH) - THE COMBO

### PHASE 1: REFRESH
- Restore SP: 5/5
- Heat check: 2 Heat (below 5, no check)

### PHASE 2: ACTION PHASE

**Alice's Thoughts**: *"Bob has SIXTEEN damage reduction. My strongest attack won't scratch him. I need Blood Offering (+3 dmg, ignore 1 Armor) + rear arc (+2 dmg) to break through."*

**Action 1: Play Blood Offering** (0 SP)
- Cost: 0 SP
- Effect: Discard 2 cards from hand, next attack +3 dmg and ignore 1 Armor
- Discard: Martyrdom Protocol, Emergency Vent

- Movement: (9,8) → (10,9) [Water, Bob's side]
- SP Remaining: 3/5

**Action 3: Move** (2 SP)
- Cost: 2 SP (Water)
- Movement: (10,9) → (11,10) [Bob's rear hex]
- SP Remaining: 1/5

**Alice is now in Bob's REAR ARC**

**Action 4: Play Faithful Thrust** (2 SP, -1 from Crusader's Vow = 1 SP)
- **Crusader's Vow**: While ≥20 HP, attacks cost -1 SP (Alice at 28/30 HP ✓)
- Cost: 1 SP
- Target: Bob at (10,10)
- Range: Melee (1 hex) ✓
- **ATTACK DECLARED**

**COMBAT RESOLUTION (WITH DICE)**:

**Step 1: Calculate To-Hit Number**
- Base: 5+
- Range: Melee (Short) = +0
- Attacker moved 4 hexes this turn (2 Water + 2 Water) = +2 (need 7+)
- Defender moved 0 hexes last turn = +0
- Hex-side facing: Attacking rear (hex 4) = -2 (need **5+**)
- Cover: Rubble = +1 (need **6+**)
- **Final To-Hit**: Need **6+**

**Step 2: Roll Attack Dice** (Alice rolls 2d6 Attack Dice)
- **Roll**: (5) + (4) = **9 total**
- **Result**: **CRITICAL HIT** (+2 damage, bypass 1 Defense)

**Step 3: Calculate Damage**:
- Base damage: 4 (Faithful Thrust)
- Blood Offering buff: +3 damage
- Critical Hit: +2 damage
- Facing: Rear arc = +3 damage
- **Total damage: 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 12 damage**

**Step 4: Roll Defense Dice** (Bob rolls 12 Defense Dice)
- **Roll**: 
- **Blocks**: 5 () = Reduce damage by 5
- **Criticals**: 2 () = +2 Component Damage
- **Heat**: 1 () = +1 Heat to Bob
- **Pierce**: 1 () = Cannot use reactive cards
- **Reduced damage**: 12 - 5 = **7 damage**

**Step 5: Apply Defense Modifiers**:
- Bob's Rune Counters: -12 damage (3 counters × 4)
- Bob's Shield Wall: -3 damage
- Bob's terrain (Rubble): -1 damage (but Critical Hit bypasses 1 Defense)
- **Total reduction**: -16 damage + 1 (Critical bypass) = **-15 damage**
- **Blood Offering**: Ignore 1 additional Armor = -14 instead of -15

**Final Damage: 7 - 14 = 0 damage** (minimum 1)

**Bob takes 1 damage (minimum damage rule)**

**Bob's Discarded Card**:
1. Crushing Blow (Primary Weapon - Runic Warhammer) ← COMPONENT DAMAGE

**Component Damage Check**:
- 1 Primary Weapon card discarded = +1 Component Damage
- 2 Defense Dice CRITICAL symbols = +2 Component Damage
- **Total Component Damage: +3** (Right Arm)
- Bob's Right Arm Component Damage: 0 → **3**
- **3 COMPONENT DAMAGE = RIGHT ARM DESTROYED**

**RIGHT ARM DESTRUCTION EFFECT** (Triggered Early!):
- Bob must **discard all Primary Weapon cards from hand immediately**
- Bob's current hand:
 - Crushing Blow (Primary) → DISCARD
 - Runic Overcharge (Tactic - keep)
 - Shield Wall (Secondary - keep)
 - Survey the Field (Universal - keep)
 - Earthshaker (Primary) → DISCARD
 - Iron Bulwark (Secondary - keep)

**Bob discards 2 Primary Weapon cards from hand**

**Bob's Reaction**: "My Right Arm is destroyed on Turn 3! I can't use Runic Warhammer attacks anymore. This is catastrophic."

**Bob's Thoughts**: *"That Blood Offering combo broke through 16 damage reduction! Even with max Rune Counters, she still destroyed my Right Arm."*

- Blood Offering buff consumed (used on this attack)
- SP Remaining: 0/5

### PHASE 3: DRAW PHASE
- Current hand: 4 cards
- Draw: 2 cards
- New hand size: 6 cards

**New cards drawn**:

## OUTCOME PROJECTION

**Current State**:
- **Alice**: 28/30 HP, Right Arm intact, full offense
- **Bob**: 29/32 HP, **Right Arm Destroyed** (no Primary Weapons), 12 damage reduction from Rune Counters

**Next 5-8 Turns**:
1. Bob can only play Universal cards (movement, Heat management) and Secondary Equipment (Siege Shield)
2. Bob's 12 damage reduction from Rune Counters means Alice can only deal minimum damage (1 per attack)
3. Alice needs to land 29 attacks to kill Bob (at 1 damage each)
4. Bob will eventually reshuffle, adding Damage cards, which accelerates his death
5. Alice wins through slow attrition, but it takes many turns

**Victor**: **Alice (Church of Absolution)**
**Victory Method**: Component destruction (Right Arm) → Bob loses offense → slow minimum-damage grind

**Estimated Turns to Victory**: Turn 15-20 (very slow due to Rune Counter defense)

---

## KEY LESSONS FROM THIS GAME

### 1. Component Destruction is Devastating
- Losing Primary Weapon = losing your faction identity
- Bob became defenseless after Right Arm destruction
- **Takeaway**: Protect components with Reactive cards (Unbreakable)

### 2. Blood Offering (Self-Harm Mechanic) is Powerful
- Alice discarded 2 cards for +3 damage + ignore 1 Armor
- This burst damage broke through Bob's 7-point damage reduction
- **Takeaway**: Self-harm for power is Church's core identity

### 3. Facing Modifiers Matter
- Rear arc attacks deal +2 damage
- Alice's Turn 3 rear attack dealt 9 damage (before mitigation)
- **Takeaway**: Positioning for rear arc is worth spending SP

### 4. Rune Counters Are Extremely Powerful
- Bob's 3 Rune Counters reduced every attack by 12 (4 damage per counter)
- This reduced all of Alice's attacks to minimum damage (1) after Turn 3
- However, losing the Right Arm meant Bob had no way to win
- **Takeaway**: Pure defense without offense is a slow death, not victory

### 5. SP Economy: Safe Zone vs Danger Zone
- Neither player entered Danger Zone (Heat Strain checks)
- Conservative SP spending avoided risk
- **Takeaway**: Danger Zone is high-risk, high-reward

### 6. Armor-Piercing Counters Defensive Builds
- Bob's Crushing Blow ignored Alice's defenses
- Dealt full 5 damage, causing 2 Component Damage
- **Takeaway**: Armor-piercing shuts down defense-stacking

### 7. Death Spiral Didn't Trigger (Yet)
- Neither player reshuffled by Turn 5
- Game would have continued 5-8 more turns
- **Takeaway**: Damage cards from reshuffles cripple deck consistency

---

## WHAT COULD BOB HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?

### Mistake 1: Didn't Use Unbreakable
- Bob had **Unbreakable** (Reactive, prevent 1 Component Damage) in hand
- Should have played it on Turn 5 when taking 3 damage
- Would have reduced Component Damage from 3 to 2, saving Right Arm

### Mistake 2: Moved Away Turn 3
- Turn 3: Bob played Advance and moved 2 hexes away
- Left Alice time to reposition and attack again
- Should have stayed adjacent and counter-attacked immediately

### Mistake 3: Didn't Stack Armor Early
- Bob had defensive cards (Shield Wall, Reinforced Hull) but used them Turn 2
- Should have saved Shield Wall for Turn 5 (when Divine Judgment hit)
- Would have reduced damage from 6 to 3 (before Rune Counters)

---

## BALANCE OBSERVATIONS

### Church Strengths Confirmed
- Blood Offering (0 SP, discard 2 cards, +3 dmg + ignore 1 Armor) is devastating
- Crusader's Vow (-1 SP while healthy) enabled extra actions
- Righteous Fury didn't trigger (no component destruction = no "kills")

### Dwarven Weaknesses Exposed
- Component destruction = complete loss of offense
- 32 HP (Stone Endurance) didn't matter (game ended at 23 HP)
- Defensive build requires surviving to late game

### Potential Balance Changes
1. **Component Destruction**: May be too punishing
 - Consider: Destroyed components reduce effectiveness (not eliminate)
 - Example: Right Arm Destroyed = Primary Weapon cards cost +1 SP (not discarded)

2. **Blood Offering**: May be too efficient
 - 0 SP cost, discard 2 cards, +3 dmg + ignore 1 Armor
 - Consider: Increase to 1 SP cost OR reduce buff to +2 dmg

3. **Unbreakable**: Bob had counter-play available but didn't use it
 - This is player error, not balance issue
 - Reward good reactive card timing

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Playtest this scenario 3-5 times** with different players
2. **Swap Tactics** (try different Church/Dwarven builds)
3. **Add Pilot Wound Decks** for full brutality (capsule breach, neural feedback)
4. **Test death spiral** mechanics (force games to 15+ turns, multiple reshuffles)
5. **Create Scenario #2** with different terrain/factions
