## OUTCOME PROJECTION

**Current State**:
- **Alice**: 23/30 HP, 2/3 Right Arm Component Damage, full offense
- **Bob**: 23/32 HP, **Right Arm Destroyed** (no Primary Weapons), pure defense

**Next 5-8 Turns**:
1. Bob can only play Universal cards (movement, Heat management) and Secondary Equipment (Siege Shield)
2. Bob will turtle with Shield Wall, but cannot deal damage back
3. Alice will chain attacks (Quick Shot, Faithful Thrust if she draws more)
4. Bob's deck will reshuffle first, adding 1 Damage card
5. Alice systematically reduces Bob to 0 HP

**Victor**: **Alice (Church of Absolution)**
**Victory Method**: Component destruction (Right Arm) → inability to counter-attack → slow attrition death

**Estimated Turns to Victory**: Turn 10-12

---

## KEY LESSONS FROM THIS GAME

### 1. Component Destruction is Devastating
- Losing Primary Weapon = losing your faction identity
- Bob became defenseless after Right Arm destruction
- **Takeaway**: Protect components with Reactive cards (Unbreakable)

### 2. Blood Offering (Self-Harm Mechanic) is Powerful
- Alice discarded 2 cards for +3 damage + ignore 1 Armor
- This burst damage broke through Bob's 7-point damage reduction
- **Takeaway**: Self-harm for power is Church's core identity

### 3. Facing Modifiers Matter
- Rear arc attacks deal +2 damage
- Alice's Turn 3 rear attack dealt 9 damage (before mitigation)
- **Takeaway**: Positioning for rear arc is worth spending SP

### 4. Rune Counters Delay but Don't Prevent Death
- Bob's 3 Rune Counters reduced every attack by 3
- However, Blood Offering "ignore 1 Armor" countered this partially
- **Takeaway**: Damage reduction is strong but not invincible

### 5. SP Economy: Safe Zone vs Danger Zone
- Neither player entered Danger Zone (Heat Strain checks)
- Conservative SP spending avoided risk
- **Takeaway**: Danger Zone is high-risk, high-reward

### 6. Armor-Piercing Counters Defensive Builds
- Bob's Crushing Blow ignored Alice's defenses
- Dealt full 5 damage, causing 2 Component Damage
- **Takeaway**: Armor-piercing shuts down defense-stacking

### 7. Death Spiral Didn't Trigger (Yet)
- Neither player reshuffled by Turn 5
- Game would have continued 5-8 more turns
- **Takeaway**: Damage cards from reshuffles cripple deck consistency

---

## WHAT COULD BOB HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?

### Mistake 1: Didn't Use Unbreakable
- Bob had **Unbreakable** (Reactive, prevent 1 Component Damage) in hand
- Should have played it on Turn 5 when taking 3 damage
- Would have reduced Component Damage from 3 to 2, saving Right Arm

### Mistake 2: Moved Away Turn 3
- Turn 3: Bob played Advance and moved 2 hexes away
- Left Alice time to reposition and attack again
- Should have stayed adjacent and counter-attacked immediately

### Mistake 3: Didn't Stack Armor Early
- Bob had defensive cards (Shield Wall, Reinforced Hull) but used them Turn 2
- Should have saved Shield Wall for Turn 5 (when Divine Judgment hit)
- Would have reduced damage from 6 to 3 (before Rune Counters)

---

## BALANCE OBSERVATIONS

### Church Strengths Confirmed
- Blood Offering (0 SP, discard 2 cards, +3 dmg + ignore 1 Armor) is devastating
- Crusader's Vow (-1 SP while healthy) enabled extra actions
- Righteous Fury didn't trigger (no component destruction = no "kills")

### Dwarven Weaknesses Exposed
- Component destruction = complete loss of offense
- 32 HP (Stone Endurance) didn't matter (game ended at 23 HP)
- Defensive build requires surviving to late game

### Potential Balance Changes
1. **Component Destruction**: May be too punishing
   - Consider: Destroyed components reduce effectiveness (not eliminate)
   - Example: Right Arm Destroyed = Primary Weapon cards cost +1 SP (not discarded)

2. **Blood Offering**: May be too efficient
   - 0 SP cost, discard 2 cards, +3 dmg + ignore 1 Armor
   - Consider: Increase to 1 SP cost OR reduce buff to +2 dmg

3. **Unbreakable**: Bob had counter-play available but didn't use it
   - This is player error, not balance issue
   - Reward good reactive card timing

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Playtest this scenario 3-5 times** with different players
2. **Swap Tactics** (try different Church/Dwarven builds)
3. **Add Pilot Wound Decks** for full brutality (capsule breach, neural feedback)
4. **Test death spiral** mechanics (force games to 15+ turns, multiple reshuffles)
5. **Create Scenario #2** with different terrain/factions
