# SCENARIO #3: ESCORT DUTY

**Type**: Asymmetric Objective
**Players**: 2 (Attacker vs Defender)
**Estimated Playtime**: 60-75 minutes
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ Advanced
**Victory Condition**:
- **Defender**: Escort the Supply Caravan to the exit
- **Attacker**: Destroy the Supply Caravan OR eliminate the Defender

---

## SCENARIO OVERVIEW

A vital supply caravan must reach the settlement before nightfall. The Defender must protect the slow-moving caravan while the Attacker tries to destroy it. The caravan is vulnerable but has basic defenses.

**What This Teaches**: Asymmetric objectives, protecting weak units, aggressive vs defensive tactics, tempo control

### Terrain Legend

- **[F] Forest**: +1 Defense, blocks LOS
- **[R] Rubble**: +1 Defense, difficult terrain (2 SP)
- **[W] Water/Mud**: Difficult terrain (2 SP), remove 1 Heat at end of turn
- **[E1] Elevation 1**: +1 damage, ignore cover when attacking from here
- **[==] Road**: Fast Movement (move 2 hexes for 1 SP), no defensive bonus

---

## SPECIAL UNITS: THE SUPPLY CARAVAN

### Caravan Stats

**HP**: 40 HP (does not use deck system - tracks damage directly)
**Movement**: 2 hexes per turn (moves during Defender's turn, costs no SP)
**Defense**: 3+ (harder to hit than Caskets)
**Size**: Large (occupies 1 hex but can be attacked from adjacent hexes)

**Armor**:
- Caravan ignores first 2 damage from each attack (heavy wooden frame)
- No component damage (caravan has no components)

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Cannot move off the Road hexes (must follow the road)
- Cannot attack or defend itself
- Takes double damage from Fire attacks

### Caravan Movement

**Automatic Movement**: At the start of each Defender's turn, the Caravan moves 2 hexes along the Road toward the exit (no SP cost).

**Blocking**: If the Attacker's Casket is standing on the Road directly in front of the Caravan, the Caravan stops moving (it cannot push through).

**Exit Point**: The Caravan exits the map when it reaches hex [15,4] or [15,5] (far right edge of road).

---

## DEPLOYMENT

### Defender Deployment
- Deploy anywhere within 3 hexes of hex [2,4] or [2,5] (near the Caravan)
- Must start within 6 hexes of the Caravan

### Attacker Deployment
- Deploy anywhere within 3 hexes of hex [13,4] or [13,5] (ambush position)
- Can deploy on either side of the road

### Caravan Starting Position
- Caravan starts on hex [1,4] (leftmost road hex)
- Faces East (toward exit)

---

## VICTORY CONDITIONS

### Defender Wins If:
1. The Caravan reaches the exit (hex [15,4] or [15,5]) **OR**
2. The Attacker's Casket is reduced to 0 HP

### Attacker Wins If:
1. The Caravan is reduced to 0 HP **OR**
2. The Defender's Casket is reduced to 0 HP **OR**
3. Turn 12 ends and the Caravan has not exited (supplies arrive too late, settlement starves)

---

## SPECIAL RULES

### Road Movement
- Moving along Road hexes (horizontally) costs **1 SP for 2 hexes** (fast travel)
- Moving OFF the road costs normal SP (1 SP per hex)
- Road provides **no defensive bonus** (you're exposed)

### Caravan Combat
- The Caravan cannot attack or use cards
- The Caravan cannot be moved by Push/Pull effects
- The Caravan ignores Heat, Taint, and Component Damage
- When the Caravan takes damage, mark it on a separate HP track (starts at 40)

### Blocking the Road
- If the Attacker stands on the Road directly in front of the Caravan, it stops moving
- The Defender can Push the Attacker off the road to unblock the Caravan
- Blocking the Caravan generates **1 Heat per turn** (engines overheat from holding position)

### Turn Limit
- The scenario ends after **Turn 12** (about 12-15 minutes of real time)
- If the Caravan has not exited by Turn 12, the Attacker wins

---

## TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Defender Strategy
- **Protect the Caravan**: Stay close and intercept the Attacker
- **Clear the Road**: Push the Attacker off the road if they're blocking
- **Speed Matters**: The faster the Caravan moves, the less time the Attacker has
- **Positioning**: Use elevation to threaten the Attacker from range

### Attacker Strategy
- **Destroy the Caravan**: Focus fire on the vulnerable Caravan
- **Block and Delay**: Stand on the Road to stop the Caravan's movement
- **Ignore the Defender**: Sometimes it's better to rush past and hit the Caravan directly
- **Use Terrain**: Elevation and rubble give you defensive bonuses while attacking

---

## BALANCING NOTES

**If Attacker Wins Too Easily**:
- Increase Caravan HP to 50
- Reduce turn limit to Turn 10

**If Defender Wins Too Easily**:
- Reduce Caravan HP to 30
- Increase turn limit to Turn 15
- Allow Attacker to deploy closer (within 5 hexes of exit)

---

## VARIANTS

### **Variant: Reinforcements**
- On Turn 6, a second Attacker Casket (controlled by same player) enters from hex [13,9] (bottom right)
- Defender must split attention between two threats

### **Variant: Hazardous Cargo**
- When the Caravan takes 20+ damage, it drops Unstable Soulstones
- Place 3 Soulstone tokens on the road where the Caravan was hit
- Any Casket that moves through those hexes takes 3 damage (explosion)

### **Variant: No Turn Limit**
- Remove the Turn 12 limit
- Attacker must destroy the Caravan OR eliminate the Defender to win
- Makes the scenario less tense but more forgiving for new players

---

## RECOMMENDED FACTIONS

**Good Defender Choices**:
- **Dwarven Forge-Guilds**: Tanky, can shield the Caravan with high armor
- **Church of Absolution**: Aggressive, can threaten the Attacker into retreating
- **Elven Verdant Covenant**: Mobile, can reposition quickly to intercept

**Good Attacker Choices**:
- **The Ossuarium**: Lifesteal and attrition, can outlast the Defender
- **Church of Absolution**: Burst damage, can kill the Caravan quickly
- **Dwarven Forge-Guilds**: Armor-piercing, ignores Caravan's armor

---

## DESIGN NOTES

This scenario tests **asymmetric objectives** and **tempo management**. The Defender must balance aggression (stopping the Attacker) with protection (keeping the Caravan safe). The Attacker must decide: "Do I destroy the Caravan, or eliminate the Defender?"

The **turn limit** creates urgency. The Defender wants to move fast; the Attacker wants to slow everything down.

**Lesson**: Not every scenario is "kill the enemy." Sometimes survival is victory.
