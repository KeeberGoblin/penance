## Overview

Dr. Theslar is a secret boss encounter designed for 3-4 veteran players. This fight uses a unique **Instability Mechanic** where the boss's corruption of the Theslar Engine causes reality itself to unravel. Players must defeat Dr. Theslar before the arena collapses into the Wound, dragging them into oblivion.

**Recommended Player Level**: Pilots with 10+ missions completed, Grit 2+
**Estimated Duration**: 90-120 minutes
**Difficulty**: NIGHTMARE

---

## Lore

Dr. Theslar is not dead. He never was. When the Theslar Engine's core breached 437 years ago, it consumed him—body, mind, and soul—and spat out something else. Something that whispers from the Wound. Something that knows your name before you speak it.

He appears as a translucent figure encased in crackling Taint energy, half-corporeal, half-nightmare. His Casket is not a machine but an extension of the Engine itself—a writhing mass of cables, flesh, and geometry that should not exist. He does not fight to kill you. He fights to *understand* you. To break you apart and study the pieces. To add you to the Engine's eternal song.

**Taint Level**: Beyond Measurement (∞)
**Casket**: "The Thesis" - A living extension of the Theslar Engine core

## Boss Stats

### Base Statistics

- **Weight Class**: Unknowable (phase-shifts between 500 lbs and 5,000 lbs)
- **Movement**: 5 hexes (ignores difficult terrain, can move through walls)
- **Armor**: 6 (Reality Ward - reduces all damage by 6 before Defense rolls)
- **Taint Resistance**: Immune (IS the source of Taint)
- **Morale**: N/A (not human anymore)

### HP Deck System

Dr. Theslar uses a **50-card HP deck** that evolves as the fight progresses. Unlike Sister Vex, his deck doesn't add cards—it *mutates* them. As damage accumulates, his AI cards transform into more dangerous versions.

**Starting Deck**: 50 AI Behavior cards
- 15x Basic Attacks (Phase 1)
- 10x Movement/Teleportation (Phase 1)
- 10x Reality Manipulation (Phase 1)
- 10x Taint Corruption (Phase 1)
- 5x The Wound (Phase 1)

As players damage Dr. Theslar, cards are removed. When he reshuffles, ALL REMAINING CARDS transform based on damage thresholds.

---

## Unique Mechanic: Instability Track

Dr. Theslar's presence destabilizes reality itself. The battlefield accumulates **Instability Points** throughout the fight.

### Instability Track (0-20)

**Starting Instability**: 0

**Instability Increases When**:
- Dr. Theslar takes damage: +1 Instability per 3 damage dealt
- Dr. Theslar uses "Pulse of the Wound" ability: +2 Instability
- A player reaches 10+ Taint: +1 Instability
- Dr. Theslar reshuffles his deck: +3 Instability
- A player dies: +5 Instability

**Instability Effects** (At end of each Round):

| Instability | Reality Effect |
|-------------|---------------|
| **0-4** | Stable. No effect. |
| **5-9** | Minor Distortion. All players roll 1d6 at start of turn. On 1, lose 1 SP this turn (temporal lag). |
| **10-14** | Reality Fractures. Random hex becomes Void terrain (see Terrain Effects). Roll 1d10 for hex location. |
| **15-19** | The Wound Opens. All players gain 2 Taint per turn. Dr. Theslar heals (shuffle 5 cards from discard into deck). |
| **20+** | **TOTAL COLLAPSE**. The arena implodes. All players must make Willpower Save (1d6, need 6+) or be consumed by the Wound (instant death). Those who pass take 10d6 damage. Dr. Theslar wins if any player dies. |

**Strategic Tension**: Players must balance SPEED (kill Dr. Theslar before Instability 20) vs SAFETY (avoid reckless damage that spikes Instability).

---

## Setup

### Boss Starting Position
Place Dr. Theslar in the center of a **16×16 hex grid** labeled "The Engine Core Chamber."

### Boss Deck Construction
Shuffle the following 50 cards:

**Phase 1 Cards (50-35 cards remaining)**:
- 15x "Theorem of Pain" (Basic Attack)
- 6x "Phase Shift" (Teleport)
- 4x "Dimensional Anchor" (Control)
- 10x "Taint Cascade" (AOE Corruption)
- 5x "Reality Distortion" (Terrain Manipulation)
- 5x "Hypothesis of Suffering" (Debuff)
- 5x "The Wound Gazes Back" (Willpower Check)

### Player Setup
- **3-4 Casket pilots** (2 players = too easy, 5+ = impossible)
- Standard 30-card decks
- Place players 8-10 hexes from boss (start at edges of arena)
- Each player starts with **3 Soulstone Fragments** (consumable: remove 3 Taint)

### Special Terrain
The Engine Core Chamber includes:

- **Engine Core (center, 4 hexes)**: Impassable. Enemies standing adjacent gain +1 Taint per turn.
- **Void Rifts (4 hexes, randomly placed each Round at Instability 10+)**: Entering costs 5 SP and deals 3d6 damage. Enemies inside cannot be targeted by ranged attacks.
- **Taint Pools (6 hexes, blue glowing)**: Difficult terrain. Remove 2 Heat at end of turn, but gain 1 Taint.
- **Stabilization Pillars (4 corners)**: Activating (3 SP, must be adjacent) reduces Instability by 2. Can only be used once each.

---

## Boss Activation

### Turn Structure
Dr. Theslar activates after ALL players have taken their turns.

**Boss Turn**:
1. Draw 4 cards from HP deck
2. Play all 4 cards in order drawn (resolve sequentially)
3. Discard cards
4. Check Instability Track and apply reality effects

If the boss deck is empty, he reshuffles immediately. ALL REMAINING CARDS transform based on current damage level (see Phase Transformations).

---

## Design Notes (For Game Master)

### Why This Works

1. **Instability Track = Ticking Clock**: Players must balance speed vs safety. Too aggressive = Instability 20 = party wipe. Too cautious = Dr. Theslar heals and grows stronger.

2. **Mutating AI Cards**: Unlike Sister Vex (who adds cards), Dr. Theslar transforms existing cards into nightmares. Fight evolves organically.

3. **Reality Manipulation**: Terrain changes, Void Rifts, forced movement create dynamic battlefield that never feels static.

4. **Taint as Dual Threat**: Taint causes Corruption (player control loss) AND increases Instability (arena collapse). Players fight two countdowns simultaneously.

5. **Dimensional Echoes**: Minions split player focus. Must prioritize: kill Dr. Theslar or clear clones?

6. **Willpower Saves = Player Agency**: Players roll Grit checks to resist Wound effects. High-Grit veterans have better survival odds (campaign progression matters).

7. **False Defeat (Conditional)**: "Absolute Theory" only triggers if Instability is 15+. Players can PREVENT resurrection by keeping Instability low. Rewards strategic play.

8. **Thematic Victory**: Defeating Dr. Theslar reduces world Instability by 5, making future campaign missions slightly easier. Players feel like heroes.

### Playtesting Notes

- **First playtest**: Adjust Instability thresholds. If players hit 20 before Phase 3, increase cap to 25.
- **If fight ends before Phase 3**: Add +10 cards to starting deck.
- **If fight drags past 120 minutes**: Reduce starting deck to 40 cards.
- **Taint accumulation**: At least 1 player should hit 8-9 Taint by Phase 3 (creates tension). If no one is threatened, increase Taint gains by +1 across all effects.
- **Instability spikes**: If players are too aggressive (Instability 10+ by Round 5), add more Stabilization Pillars (6 total instead of 4).
- **Dimensional Echoes**: Max 3 clones on field at once. If more would spawn, oldest clone disappears (absorbed back into Dr. Theslar).

### Hidden Encounter Design Philosophy

This fight is intentionally BRUTAL because it's optional and hidden. Players who find this encounter should feel:
1. **Fear**: "This is impossible. We might not survive."
2. **Tension**: "One wrong move and we hit Instability 20."
3. **Triumph**: "We beat the secret boss. We're legends."

Do NOT balance this fight for casual players. This is for veterans who want to test their limits.

---

## Variant: The Recursive Loop (Solo Challenge)

For the ULTIMATE challenge, face Dr. Theslar alone (1 player).

**Changes**:
- Dr. Theslar starts with 30 cards (reduced)
- Instability cap at 25 (instead of 20)
- Dr. Theslar draws 3 cards per turn (instead of 4)
- Player starts with 5 Soulstone Fragments (instead of 3)
- Player can use Stabilization Pillars 3 times each
- No Dimensional Echo clones spawn (removed)

**But**:
- All of Dr. Theslar's attacks target YOU (no target selection)
- "Marked for Study" effect is permanent (cannot be removed)
- When you would be defeated, roll Willpower Save (1d6 + Grit, need 7+). Success: Survive at 1 card. Fail: Death.

**Reward**:
- If you win solo: Unlock **"The Lone Saint"** title. Gain permanent +1 Grit on this pilot. Unlock unique cosmetic Casket skin.

## Secret Unlock Instructions (For GMs)

### How to Reveal This Encounter

This encounter is intentionally hidden. Players should discover it through exploration or narrative clues, not be told directly.

**Suggested Discovery Methods**:

1. **Settlement Event**: Roll on Settlement Event Table. On result 95+, players find "Theslar's Journal Fragment" (reveals location of Engine Core Chamber).

2. **Mission Reward**: Defeating Sister Vex has 10% chance to drop "Coordinates to the Deep Engine" (leads to this fight).

3. **Narrative Hook**: NPC in settlement mentions "strange readings from the old Engine Core levels. Something's down there. Something alive."

4. **Exploration**: If players specifically ask to explore the Theslar Engine's lowest levels, allow them to discover the entrance.

**GM Script When Players Find Entrance**:

> "The corridor descends far deeper than the maps show. The walls pulse with a sickly blue glow. You feel the temperature drop. Your Caskets' Taint sensors spike. At the end of the tunnel, a chamber. In the center, a figure. Translucent. Crackling with energy. He turns. He smiles. You feel him looking *through* you. A voice, everywhere and nowhere: 'Ah. New variables. How delightful.'"

**DO NOT tell players this is a secret boss until they enter the chamber. Let the dread build naturally.**

---

## Easter Egg Dialogue (Optional)

If players use certain items or abilities, Dr. Theslar responds with unique dialogue:

**If player uses Soulstone Fragment**:
> "Ah, consuming your own currency. The Engine would approve. It is, after all, a closed system."

**If player has 9 Taint (one away from Corruption)**:
> "You stand on the precipice. One more step. I wonder: will you jump, or will I push?"

**If player destroys a Dimensional Echo**:
> "You kill me, but I am already dead. You kill me, but I am already reborn. Do you see the recursion?"

**If Instability reaches exactly 15**:
> "The veil thins. Can you feel it? The Wound breathes. It knows your name now."

**If player reaches 0 HP but survives via relic/ability**:
> "Fascinating. You refuse the conclusion. Very well. Let us test your hypothesis again."

**If player activates all 4 Stabilization Pillars**:
> "Ah, you fight the inevitable. Entropy is not your enemy, child. It is your destiny."

**When Dr. Theslar enters Phase 4**:
> "You have reduced me. Diminished me. But in my smallness, I am infinite. Let me show you."

**If Dr. Theslar is defeated without "Absolute Theory" triggering**:
> [Final words] "Remarkable. You have... disproven me. How... scientific. Tell me—[static]—does the Engine... remember... me...?" [He dissolves into Taint, leaving only the Thesis Fragment]

**If "Absolute Theory" triggers (resurrection)**:
> "Did you think death was the end? *Death is a variable.* I control the variables. **I AM THE EQUATION.**"
