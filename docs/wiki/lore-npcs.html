        <h2>1. Sister Vex - "The Hollow Penitent"</h2>
        <h3>Church of Absolution</h3>

        <p><strong>Casket Type</strong>: Heavy - "The Confessional" (1,600 lbs)<br>
        <strong>Taint Level</strong>: 7 (Advanced Corruption)</p>

        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
        <p>Sister Vex no longer has a face. Where her eyes, nose, and mouth once were, there is now a smooth expanse of scar tissue, ritually burned away in an act of "purification." She navigates through a network of communion-stones surgically embedded in her skull, which pulse with dull red light when she "sees." Her body is covered in prayer-chains welded directly to her ribs, which jingle and tear at the skin when she moves.</p>

        <p>She wears the robes of a High Penitent, but beneath them her flesh has begun to crystallize - patches of Soulstone growing directly from her bones like tumors. The Church calls this "blessed stigmata." She knows better.</p>

        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>Vex was once the Inquisition's most feared prosecutor - a woman who burned suspected Taint-bearers with righteous fury. When her own daughter tested positive for Void corruption, Vex faced an impossible choice: execute her own child or admit the Church's doctrine was flawed.</p>

        <p>She chose a third option: she took her daughter's Taint into herself through a forbidden blood ritual, hoping to "purify" it through her own penance. It didn't work. Her daughter died anyway, consumed by the transfer. Vex survived, but the Taint took root in her soul.</p>

        <p>Rather than face execution, she mutilated herself—removing her face so she could no longer weep, becoming a "living penance." The Church, desperate for propaganda, declared her a saint. She piloted The Confessional into battle, seeking death with every sortie. Death refuses to take her.</p>

        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Monotone and hollow - speaks without inflection, as if reading from a script</li>
            <li>Obsessive about ritual - performs hourly self-flagellation, even mid-conversation</li>
            <li>Paradoxically kind to the corrupted - shows mercy to Taint-bearers, harshness to the "pure"</li>
            <li>Suicidal but cannot die - her Soulstone keeps regenerating fatal wounds</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Unique Casket Abilities</h4>
        <p><strong>The Confessional</strong> is a walking iron cathedral, covered in hanging chains and prayer bells. Its interior is a torture chamber where Vex pilots from a throne of nails.</p>

            <li>Vex knows a secret ritual to remove Taint permanently, but it requires a sacrifice she refuses to make again</li>
            <li>She's been seen speaking to something that isn't there - is it her dead daughter, or something worse?</li>

        <h2>2. Rootwarden Kess - "The Pruner"</h2>
        <h3>Elven Verdant Covenant</h3>

        <p><strong>Casket Type</strong>: Scout - "The Briar-Thorn" (650 lbs)<br>
        <strong>Taint Level</strong>: 0 (Immune - see Rootbound)</p>

        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
        <p>Kess is not entirely elven anymore. Her lower body has fused with her Casket - roots and vines growing through her legs, spine, and pelvis in a symbiotic nightmare. She cannot leave The Briar-Thorn; to do so would be to tear herself in half. Her skin has a greenish tint, and bark-like growths cover her shoulders and forearms.</p>

        <p>Most disturbing are her hands: the fingers have split into twig-like appendages, allowing her to interface directly with her Casket's living wood. When she pilots, she <em>becomes</em> the machine, feeling its pain as her own.</p>

        <p>Her eyes are solid amber - no pupils, no whites - and sap occasionally leaks from the corners like tears.</p>

        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>Kess was a Rootwarden - a druidic order responsible for "pruning" corrupted sections of the Worldheart's ley lines. When a Void rift opened in her grove, she made a desperate choice: rather than let the corruption spread, she grafted herself to a juvenile World-Tree sapling and used it as a living filter, absorbing the Taint through the plant before it could reach the ley line.</p>

        <p>It worked. The ley line was saved. But Kess paid the price: the sapling and her body merged irreversibly, and she became something neither plant nor elf. The Covenant calls her a hero. She calls herself a mistake.</p>

        <p>Now she "prunes" in a different way - hunting sources of corruption and cutting them away with surgical precision. She believes the entire world is a garden, and she is the gardener. Everything that doesn't belong must be <em>removed</em>.</p>

        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Eerily calm, even when killing - violence is just pruning to her</li>
            <li>Speaks in agricultural metaphors - "Your roots are diseased." "You've overgrown your soil."</li>
            <li>No concept of moral complexity - things are either "healthy" or "blighted"</li>
            <li>Obsessed with symmetry and balance - will rearrange corpses after battle into aesthetically pleasing patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Unique Casket Abilities</h4>
        <p><strong>The Briar-Thorn</strong> is a lithe, insectoid Casket made of living wood, constantly sprouting thorny vines that retract and extend like muscles.</p>

        <h2>3. Forgemaster Durr - "The Calculator"</h2>
        <h3>Dwarven Forge-Guilds</h3>

        <p><strong>Casket Type</strong>: Support - "The Abacus" (1,100 lbs)<br>
        <strong>Taint Level</strong>: 3 (Controlled/Measured)</p>

        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
        <p>Durr has replaced 60% of his body with clockwork prosthetics. His left arm is a multi-tool apparatus, his right leg is a piston-driven hydraulic limb, and his lungs have been augmented with brass bellows that wheeze audibly when he breathes. One eye has been replaced with a magnifying lens array that clicks and rotates when he focuses.</p>

        <p>He's covered in self-inflicted scars from "measurement experiments" - testing pain thresholds, burn tolerance, and structural integrity of his own bones. His beard is singed and patchy from forge accidents, and his hands are covered in acid burns from Soulstone refinement.</p>

        <p>Most disturbing: he's installed a pressure gauge in his own chest, visible through a glass window in his sternum, which tracks his blood pressure in real-time. He obsessively checks it, adjusting his breathing to keep it at exactly 120/80.</p>

        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>Durr was the lead engineer on Project Resonance Echo - a Dwarven attempt to replicate Theslar's original Engine on a smaller, controlled scale. The experiment failed catastrophically, killing his entire research team and leaving Durr buried under rubble for three days.</p>

        <p>When they dug him out, he'd calculated the exact engineering failure that caused the collapse - a rounding error in the 47th decimal place of a load-bearing formula. The realization broke something in him: if a single rounding error could kill 200 dwarves, then the entire universe was a poorly designed machine running on faulty math.</p>

        <p>He now treats everything - emotions, combat, morality - as engineering problems to be solved through calculation. He rebuilt himself with prosthetics to "eliminate biological inefficiencies," and pilots The Abacus with cold, mathematical precision.</p>

        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Emotionally flat - expresses everything in equations and probabilities</li>
            <li>Obsessed with efficiency - will sacrifice allies if the math favors it</li>
            <li>Compulsively measures everything - carries calipers, scales, and timers at all times</li>
            <li>Views organics as inferior machines - increasingly contemptuous of "flesh-logic"</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Unique Casket Abilities</h4>
        <p><strong>The Abacus</strong> is a boxy, geometric Casket covered in measurement instruments, gears, and clicking counters. It hums with mechanical precision.</p>

        <h2>4. Bonelord Thresh - "The Debt Collector"</h2>
        <h3>The Ossuarium</h3>

        <p><strong>Casket Type</strong>: Assault - "The Creditor" (2,200 lbs)<br>
        <strong>Taint Level</strong>: N/A (Undead - immune to corruption via technicality)</p>

        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
        <p>Thresh is a skeletal lich wrapped in tattered finery - nobleman's robes from the Old World, now moth-eaten and bloodstained. His skull is pristine ivory, polished to a mirror sheen, with rubies socketed in his eye sockets that glow with cold light.</p>

        <p>His bones are inscribed with contracts - thousands of names etched in microscopic script, covering every surface of his skeleton. These are souls he "owns" through predatory necromantic pacts. When he speaks, the names whisper in chorus.</p>

        <p>Most unsettling: Thresh has <em>too many bones</em>. Extra ribs, redundant finger bones, spare vertebrae - all from previous owners, grafted onto his frame like grotesque trophies. He occasionally removes a bone and offers it as "payment" for services rendered.</p>

        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>Before the Cataclysm, Thresh was a loan shark and contract lawyer - a man who made fortunes exploiting the desperate. When the Sundering occurred, he saw opportunity: in the chaos, he made necromantic pacts with dying survivors, promising "eternal life" in exchange for "small favors after death."</p>

        <p>Hundreds took the deal. They didn't read the fine print.</p>

        <p>Thresh kept his promises - he did grant eternal life. But the contracts stipulated that the soul remained <em>his property</em>, to be called upon for labor, combat, or experimentation. He's built an undead empire on predatory lending, and his "collection agency" enforces debts with brutal efficiency.</p>

        <p>He pilots The Creditor into battle not for glory, but for <strong>acquisition</strong> - every enemy killed is a potential asset to be repossessed.</p>

        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Relentlessly polite - always uses formal titles, never raises his voice</li>
            <li>Obsessed with contracts and debts - views all relationships as transactions</li>
            <li>Patient and calculating - willing to wait centuries for the "right moment" to collect</li>
            <li>Surprisingly honest - never lies, but always finds loopholes</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Unique Casket Abilities</h4>
        <p><strong>The Creditor</strong> is a massive, iron sarcophagus on legs, covered in ledgers and tally marks. Souls scream from its vents.</p>

        <h2>5. Mockingbird - "The Many-Masked Bargainer"</h2>
        <h3>The Wyrd Conclave</h3>

        <p><strong>Casket Type</strong>: Aberrant - "The Mirror-Dance" (800 lbs - variable)<br>
        <strong>Taint Level</strong>: ??? (Unmeasurable - Fae physiology is weird)</p>

        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
        <p>Mockingbird doesn't have a face. Or rather, she has too many. She wears a constantly shifting array of porcelain masks, each representing a different identity she's stolen over the centuries. The masks phase in and out of existence, flickering like reflections in broken mirrors.</p>

        <p>Beneath the masks, there's nothing - just a void filled with distant stars and impossible geometries.</p>

        <p>Her body is similarly unstable: sometimes she has two arms, sometimes six, sometimes none. Her height varies by several feet from moment to moment. Her voice is a chorus of stolen identities, speaking in overlapping echoes.</p>

        <p>The only constant is her Casket's core - a mirror-polished sphere that reflects not what <em>is</em>, but what <em>could be</em>.</p>

        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>Mockingbird is old - old enough that she doesn't remember her true name, if she ever had one. She is a collector of <em>possibilities</em> - alternate versions of events that never happened. When the Sundering opened dimensional rifts, she walked through, fascinated by this new, broken world.</p>

        <p>She doesn't fight for territory or resources. She fights for <em>stories</em> - collecting the "what-ifs" of every battle. What if the hero turned coward? What if the villain showed mercy? What if the dead lived and the living died?</p>

        <p>She steals these alternate outcomes and wears them like masks, becoming a walking archive of roads not taken. Some say she's trying to find the version of reality where the Cataclysm never happened. Others say she's the reason it happened in the first place.</p>

        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Playful and cruel in equal measure - treats combat like performance art</li>
            <li>Speaks in riddles and hypotheticals - "What if I told you the sky was the ground?"</li>
            <li>Obsessed with bargains - will trade anything for a good story</li>
            <li>No concept of linear time - references events that haven't happened yet</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Unique Casket Abilities</h4>
        <p><strong>The Mirror-Dance</strong> is an impossible Casket - its parts don't connect logically, suspended in space like a cubist painting given motion.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mockingbird claims she can undo any event - even death - for the right price</li>
            <li>She's been collecting "masks" of the players - alternate versions where they made different choices</li>
            <li>She knows where the original Engine blueprints are hidden - but wants a "story worth telling" in trade</li>

        <h2>Using These NPCs in Play</h2>

        <h3>As Antagonists</h3>

        <h3>As Allies</h3>
        <p>Players might temporarily ally with these NPCs during crisis events (Abomination raids, faction wars), creating uncomfortable partnerships.</p>

        <h3>As Faction Representatives</h3>
        <p>Use these NPCs during <strong>Faction Negotiation scenes</strong> - they embody their faction's philosophy but in twisted, extreme ways.</p>

        <h3>As Cautionary Tales</h3>
        <p>These NPCs show players what happens when you lean too hard into Casket piloting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vex</strong> - martyrdom becomes addiction</li>
            <li><strong>Kess</strong> - you merge with your machine</li>
            <li><strong>Durr</strong> - you lose your humanity to optimization</li>
            <li><strong>Thresh</strong> - you exploit others until you're hollow</li>
            <li><strong>Mockingbird</strong> - you forget what's real</li>
        </ul>
