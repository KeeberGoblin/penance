        <h2>Lore</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church of Absolution was founded 12 years after the Sundering by the first Penitent Knights who refused to accept that death was the end. They believe that Remnants exist in a state of purgatory—neither alive nor dead—and that only through violent atonement can they earn true rest.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church controls the southern territories through a combination of religious fervor and military might. Their Caskets are gothic war machines covered in scripture and prayer scrolls, piloted by the dead seeking forgiveness. Each kill is recorded as a prayer. Each wound taken is a step closer to salvation.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "In iron we seek forgiveness. Through blood, absolution. When the enemy falls, we are one step closer to redemption."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—High Confessor Marius, Sermon of the Fallen</span>
        </div>

        <div class="ornamental-break">&#10047; &#10047; &#10047;</div>

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Blood Offering & Righteous Fury</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Church Caskets channel suffering into power through the <strong>Blood Offering</strong> system and scale infinitely through <strong>Righteous Fury</strong>.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Blood Offering:</strong> Discard 2 cards from your deck (self-harm). Your next attack gains +3 damage, ignores 1 Defense, and has -1 to target number (easier to hit).</li>
            <li><strong>Righteous Fury (Passive):</strong> Each time an allied Casket is destroyed, gain +1 damage to all attacks permanently for the rest of the mission (stacks infinitely).</li>
            <li><strong>Martyrdom Protocol:</strong> Redirect damage from allies to yourself. Gain Heat but protect the faithful.</li>
            <li><strong>Divine Judgment:</strong> Execute low-HP targets with massive burst damage. Judgment delayed is judgment magnified.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Church playstyle revolves around aggressive trades: sacrifice your own HP for devastating burst damage, protect allies to build Righteous Fury stacks, and turn suffering into absolution. High risk, high reward martyrdom.
        </p>

        <h2>Recommended Builds</h2>

        <h3>Aggressive Martyr (Confessor - Scout, 6 SP)</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Longsword (6 cards), Buckler Shield (2 cards), Martyr's Brand Sigil (3 cards)</li>
            <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> Flagellant's Zeal (burst 5 SP once per mission), Crusader's Vow (SP efficiency)</li>
            <li><strong>Total Deck:</strong> 29 cards (fast cycle, aggressive)</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Blood Offering turn 1 for alpha strike. Longsword provides reliable melee attacks. Martyr's Brand enables ally protection. Trade HP aggressively for positioning and damage. Fast, furious, dies gloriously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Defensive Support (Martyr - Assault, 5 SP)</h3>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Mace (5 cards), Tower Shield (4 cards), Martyr's Brand Sigil (3 cards), Reinforced Plating (3 cards)</li>
            <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> Absolution (Heat purge + healing), Crusader's Vow</li>
            <li><strong>Total Deck:</strong> 33 cards (balanced, tanky)</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Tower Shield + Reinforced Plating = massive defense. Mace breaks armor. Martyrdom Protocol + Martyr's Brand = ultimate ally protector. Consecrated Ground turns area into healing zone. Slow but unkillable support tank.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Greatsword (8 cards, 2-handed), Repair Sigil (2), Heat Sink Sigil (2), Spike Plating (2)</li>
            <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> Flagellant's Zeal, Absolution</li>
            <li><strong>Total Deck:</strong> 32 cards (heavy offense, self-destructive)</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Spam Blood Offering + Greatsword Cleave for AoE devastation. Flagellant's Zeal provides burst SP for massive turns. Repair Sigil + Absolution recover HP after self-harm. Play on the edge of death, weaponize suffering.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="ornamental-break">&#10047; &#10047; &#10047;</div>

        <h2>Strategy Notes</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Highest burst damage in game (Blood Offering + Divine Judgment), infinite scaling (Righteous Fury +1 per ally death), excellent ally protection (Martyrdom Protocol, Consecrated Ground), resource recursion (Last Rites, Consecrated Ground recover cards), flexible builds (melee DPS, ranged support, tank, berserker).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Self-destructive mechanics (Blood Offering, Flagellant's Zeal harm you), Heat management issues (Martyrdom Protocol generates Heat), relies on allies for some mechanics (Last Rites, Righteous Fury), low sustain without Repair Sigil (self-harm spirals without healing), vulnerable when isolated (support mechanics need team).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Use Blood Offering turn 1 for alpha strike to establish early pressure. Position aggressively—Martyrdom Protocol lets you tank for allies. Save Consecrated Ground until you're at ~15 HP or allies need healing. Build board presence.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Trade HP for positioning and damage (you have healing tools). Use Divine Judgment as execute when enemy reaches 10 HP or less. Protect allies with Martyrdom Protocol to build Righteous Fury stacks. Control key hexes with Consecrated Ground zones.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> If Righteous Fury has +3-4 damage stacks, you dominate the battlefield. Use Flagellant's Zeal for final desperate push (5 burst SP). Absolution if Heat critical (expensive but worth it). Last Rites turns ally deaths into massive card advantage. Win through accumulated power and sacrifice.
        </p>

        <h2>Development History</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Prior to 2016:</strong> Project Medieval Mech Area established as initial concept for mechanized fantasy warfare with theological themes.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>2019:</strong> Initial game concept developed with Church of Absolution as flagship faction. Early designs focused on martyrdom mechanics but lacked comprehensive documentation and system knowledge. Fixed 30-card deck structure implemented.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>2025:</strong> Current v2.0 playtest-ready system launched. Equipment system overhaul replacing fixed decks with modular loadouts (26-50 cards). Support Units system added (6 units per faction). Church refined to focus on Blood Offering, Righteous Fury scaling, and ally protection mechanics. Complete documentation finalized.
