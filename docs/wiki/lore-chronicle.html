            <p>She was walking through the village, calm as morning mist. Every few steps, she'd stop, tilt her head like she was listening to something we couldn't hear, and then... <em>prune</em>.</p>

            Forgemaster Durr has calculated optimal resource extraction path. Efficiency: 94%.<br>
            Casualty projection: 2.3 fatalities (acceptable loss ratio).</p>

            <p><strong>Mission Log, Day 12</strong><br>
            Durr's calculations remain accurate. 2 fatalities so far (within parameters).<br>
            Morale is low. Crew questions Durr's methods. He has reminded them that emotions are statistically irrelevant.</p>

            <p><strong>Mission Log, Day 15</strong><br>
            Void rift encountered. Durr ordered advance despite danger.<br>
            Quote: "Probability of success is 68%. Acceptable."<br>
            3 additional casualties. Total now 5 (above projection).</p>

            <p><strong>Mission Log, Day 18</strong><br>
            Durr has revised calculations. Quote: "Initial data was insufficient. Updated casualty projection: 7.1 fatalities."<br>
            Crew demanded retreat. Durr refused. Quote: "Sunk cost fallacy. We proceed."</p>

            <p><strong>Mission Log, Day 21</strong><br>
            9 dead. Durr unapologetic. Quote: "Randomness is just insufficient data. I will improve the algorithm."</p>

            <p><strong>Mission Log, Day 22</strong><br>
            Durr was found in his Casket, recalibrating his prediction models using corpses as data points.<br>
            He measured each wound. Recorded time of death. Improved his formula.</p>

            <p><strong>Research Log: Soulstone Origin Study</strong></p>

            <p>I've analyzed 247 Soulstone samples from across the seven factions. Crystallography, spectral analysis, Taint-resonance mapping.</p>

            <p>The Church says they're fragments of fallen angels.<br>
            The Elves say they're crystallized Worldheart blood.<br>
            The Dwarves say they're exotic radiation byproduct.</p>

            <p>They're all wrong.</p>

            <p>And they're all right.</p>

            <p>Soulstones aren't <em>formed</em> by the Void. They're <em>attracted</em> by sapient thought.</p>

            <p>When reality bleeds Void energy, nearby conscious minds shape it. Unconsciously. Based on their beliefs.</p>

            <p>Near human settlements? The stones grow in divine patterns (because they <em>believe</em> it's divine).<br>
            Near Elven groves? They grow like roots (because they <em>believe</em> it's natural).<br>
            Near dragon lairs? They incorporate fossilized dragon essence (because they <em>believe</em> the legends).</p>

            <p>The Void is chaos. Raw, unformed potential.</p>

            <p>We're the ones giving it shape.</p>

            <p>We're creating our own prisons.</p>

            <p><strong>Addendum</strong>: I've been approached by agents who want this research buried. They say "the truth would destabilize society."</p>

            <p>They're right.</p>

            <p>If people knew that Soulstones are shaped by belief, factions would lose their ideological foundations. The Church's divine mandate? False. The Elven sacred duty? Delusion. The Dwarven objective science? Biased.</p>

            <p>Everything they fight for is built on a lie they're telling themselves.</p>

            <p>I'm going into hiding. If you're reading this, I'm probably dead.</p>

            <p>Don't tell them the truth.</p>

            <p>Let them keep believing.</p>

            <p>It's kinder.</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic; color: var(--aged-gold);">GM Note: This is the secret truth. Players who discover this will face a choice: reveal it and shatter the world's belief systems, or stay silent and preserve the status quo. Neither is right.</p>

        <h2>Using Chronicle Entries in Play</h2>

        <h3>Flavor Text</h3>
        <p>Read these aloud at the start of sessions to establish tone and foreshadow events.</p>

        <h3>Investigation Rewards</h3>
        <p>Players who research in Archives or question NPCs can uncover these as "loot" (knowledge instead of equipment).</p>

        <h3>Moral Dilemmas</h3>
        <p>Several Chronicles (especially IX and X) present ethical questions players must grapple with.</p>

        <h3>Campaign Foreshadowing</h3>
        <p>Chronicle VII (Dragon's Warning) and Chronicle IX (Screaming Choir) hint at late-game revelations.</p>
