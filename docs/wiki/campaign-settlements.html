        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Drawing from Kingdom Death's settlement phase, this system focuses on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meaningful scarcity</strong> - resources are always limited, forcing hard choices</li>
            <li><strong>Interconnected upgrades</strong> - buildings unlock other buildings, creating strategic paths</li>
            <li><strong>Narrative consequences</strong> - settlements tell stories through their architecture</li>
            <li><strong>Asymmetric disasters</strong> - settlements can be destroyed, and recovery is brutal</li>
            <li><strong>No pure optimization</strong> - every choice has a cost</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Core Mechanics</h2>

        <h3>Settlement Phases</h3>
        <p><strong>Campaign Structure:</strong> Missions ‚Üí Settlement Phase ‚Üí Missions ‚Üí Settlement Phase</p>

        <p>After every <strong>2-3 missions</strong>, players return to their settlement for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Triage</strong> - Repair damaged Caskets, treat wounded pilots</li>
            <li><strong>Workshop</strong> - Spend Credits on upgrades and equipment</li>
            <li><strong>Construction</strong> - Build or upgrade settlement buildings</li>
            <li><strong>Events</strong> - Roll on the Settlement Event table (both good and bad)</li>
            <li><strong>Preparation</strong> - Choose next mission, assign pilots</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Design Notes</h2>

        <h3>Why This System Works</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Scarcity Creates Tension</strong> - You can't build everything, forcing priorities</li>
            <li><strong>Buildings Tell Stories</strong> - A settlement with a Reliquary and Ossuarium feels different from one with a Sanctuary and Archive</li>
            <li><strong>Disasters Hurt</strong> - Kingdom Death's lesson: loss must be meaningful</li>
            <li><strong>Asymmetric Paths</strong> - Church settlements play differently from Scrap-Clan ones</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Balancing Act</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Rate:</strong> ~150-200 Credits per 2 missions (after repairs)</li>
            <li><strong>Building Costs:</strong> Tier 1 (~100), Tier 2 (~200), Tier 3 (~400)</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> ~15 missions to build a fully upgraded settlement (if you're efficient and lucky)</li>
        </ul>
