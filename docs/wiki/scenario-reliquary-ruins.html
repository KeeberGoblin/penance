        <h2>Scenario Description</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Reliquary Ruins is an objective control scenario where two Caskets battle for sacred shrines scattered across a ruined cathedral complex. Victory doesn't require killing your opponent—controlling the majority of Reliquaries is enough. This scenario emphasizes map control, mobility, and strategic positioning over pure combat prowess.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Five Reliquaries (worth 10 total control points) are scattered across the 14×12 battlefield. The Central Cathedral (R3) is the most valuable objective, sitting atop Elevation 2 with 4 hexes worth 2 total points. Players must balance offensive pressure with objective scoring, choosing when to contest enemy-held shrines versus securing their own.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            This scenario teaches advanced tactics: when to contest enemy objectives vs securing your own, mobility vs durability trade-offs, high-ground advantage, and long-term planning for domination victory conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>How Control Works</h3>

        <p class="manuscript-text">At the <strong>END of each Round</strong> (both players have taken a turn):</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Check which Reliquary hexes each player is standing on</li>
            <li>Award control points:
                <ul class="manuscript-list">
                    <li>R1, R2, R4, R5: <strong>1 point per hex occupied</strong></li>
                    <li>R3 (Central Cathedral): <strong>2 points if ANY of the 4 hexes occupied</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Track cumulative control points on paper or tokens</li>
            <li><strong>Victory Check:</strong> If one player has <strong>6+ points</strong> (majority control), they win immediately</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Important:</strong> If both players occupy different hexes of the same Reliquary (e.g., Church on R1-Hex1, Dwarves on R1-Hex2), <strong>NEITHER player scores points</strong> from that Reliquary. This creates "contesting" gameplay where denying opponent scoring is as valuable as scoring yourself.

        <h3>Special Terrain Rules</h3>

        <h4>1. Objective Denial (Contesting)</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            You can <strong>contest</strong> a Reliquary by standing on it, denying opponent control. If Church is on R1-Hex1 and Dwarves are on R1-Hex2, <strong>NEITHER player scores points</strong> from R1 that round. Blocking opponent scoring is as valuable as scoring yourself, especially if you're ahead on points.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Central Cathedral High Ground</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            R3 (Central Cathedral) is the most valuable objective, sitting on Elevation 2 with the following benefits:
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Worth <strong>2 points</strong> (highest value objective)</li>
            <li>+2 damage to all attacks FROM this position</li>
            <li>Ignore cover when attacking from R3</li>
            <li>+2 Defense when standing on R3 (Elevation bonus + Reliquary bonus)</li>
            <li>Costs <strong>3 SP to climb</strong> from ground level (expensive for slow Caskets!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Tactical Note:</strong> Dwarven Fortress Caskets have only 3 SP per turn, meaning climbing to R3 costs their ENTIRE turn. Church Scouts (6 SP) can climb and still have 3 SP remaining for attacks. This asymmetry creates interesting strategic tension.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Pillar Cover (Chokepoints)</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Pillars (P) provide <strong>total cover</strong>, creating tactical bottlenecks:
        </p>
        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li>Cannot attack through Pillars (LOS completely blocked)</li>
            <li>Must move around to get line of sight</li>
            <li>+2 Defense when standing on Pillar hex</li>
            <li>Forces close-range combat near objectives</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Enhanced Heat Management</h4>
        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Water hexes remove <strong>2 Heat</strong> (instead of standard 1), encouraging aggressive Heat buildup. Risk/reward: spend 2 SP to enter Water, remove 2 Heat. Dwarves (high Heat generation) benefit more from this enhanced cooling.

            <strong>Strategy:</strong> Ultimate fortress tank. Only 3 SP per turn (Fortress class) = must choose actions carefully. Rush Central Cathedral (R3, 2 points) early, fortify with Rune Counters. Greatsword deals massive damage (6-10 per hit) with area denial. Reinforced Plating + Rune Counters = extreme damage reduction (-6 total). Repair Kit sustains through long games. 35 HP deck outlasts Church. Hold Cathedral, force Church to come to you, control South Shrines (R4) for 4 total points. Win through attrition and area denial.
