        <h2>Species Origins</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Dwarves are not a separate species from humanity, but rather <strong>Homo Subterra</strong> - a divergent human evolution adapted to subterranean life over approximately 40,000 years. Their physiology reflects millennia of underground existence.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Physiology:</strong> Stocky build with dense bones adapted to high-pressure underground environments, enhanced low-light vision (tapetum lucidum similar to felines), resistance to toxic gases and radiation - evolutionary necessities for deep mining</li>
            <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 150-200 years, roughly double that of surface humans</li>
            <li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> Dwarven nervous systems are naturally less sensitive to ley lines, making them resistant to Taint and magical corruption</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-Sundering Population:</strong> Approximately 1.5 million globally, concentrated in vast underground cities like Ironhearth, Stoneroot, and The Deeps</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Before the Sundering, dwarves remained hidden from most of humanity. Their cities existed entirely underground beneath mountain ranges, and while they traded with surface humans through intermediaries like the Merchant Guilds, most humans assumed they were simply reclusive human mining clans. Dwarven-forged goods were sold under human brand names, concealing their true origin.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            When the Sundering struck, the dwarves survived where others perished. Already underground and shielded from the initial Pulse, their cities remained largely intact. Their master craftsmen and engineers retained pre-Cataclysm knowledge and technology that other factions lost. This made them indispensable in the post-apocalyptic world.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Post-Sundering, the Dwarven Forge-Guilds became the industrial powerhouses of the shattered world. Pragmatic and profit-minded, they sell weapons, Caskets, and runecraft to all factions - they'll trade with anyone who can pay. Their isolation and resistance to magical corruption positioned them uniquely as war-profiteers and neutral suppliers in the endless conflicts between other factions.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;"><span style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--dark-red);">&#10047;</span></div>

        <h2>Lore & Identity</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Dwarven Forge-Guilds retreated underground when the Theslar Engine sundered the world. Their mountain kingdoms became fortresses of survival, where master engineers and runecrafters worked in harmony to create the most durable Caskets in existence.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Dwarven Caskets are walking fortresses—layered stone armor, interlocking plates, and ancient runes carved into every surface. Where other factions use speed or cunning, Dwarves simply outlast. Their philosophy is simple: endure long enough, and your enemy will exhaust themselves against your walls.
        </p>

        <div class="manuscript-quote">
            "We do not rush. We do not flee. We stand. And when our enemies are spent, we advance."
            <span class="quote-attribution">—Runemaster Thorin Ironvein</span>
        </div>

        <div class="ornamental-break">&#10047; &#10047; &#10047;</div>

        <h2>Core Mechanic: Rune Counters</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            Dwarven Caskets generate <strong>Rune Counters</strong> through combat, which provide stacking damage reduction.
        </p>

        <ul class="manuscript-list">
            <li><strong>Rune of Protection:</strong> Spend 2 SP to gain 1 Rune Counter. Each counter reduces all damage by 1 (max 3 counters).</li>
            <li><strong>Runic Overcharge (Tactic):</strong> Spend 3 SP to gain 2 Rune Counters immediately. Gain 2 Heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Stone Endurance (Tactic):</strong> Your maximum HP is 32 instead of 30 (add 2 extra cards to deck).</li>
            <li><strong>Armor-Piercing Attacks:</strong> All Dwarven weapons ignore Defense buffs and armor (faction bonus).</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            The Dwarven playstyle revolves around stacking defensive layers (Rune Counters, shields, plating) while grinding down opponents with armor-piercing attacks. Heat management is critical—many Dwarven weapons generate significant Heat.
        </p>

        <h2>Strategy Notes</h2>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Highest survivability in game (32 HP with Stone Endurance), all weapons gain armor-piercing, component protection (Unbreakable delays destruction), Heat conversion mechanics (Forge Fury turns Heat into damage, Forge Mastery into card draw), attrition warfare mastery.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Low mobility (Heavy/Fortress Caskets move 1-2 hexes), high Heat generation (constant management required), SP-starved (Heavy and Fortress have only 3-4 SP per turn), vulnerable to ranged kiting (slow movement + melee focus), expensive equipment (Dwarven gear costs 5-6 Scrap to craft).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Early Game (Turns 1-3):</strong> Stack Rune Counters immediately (Rune of Protection + Runic Overcharge = 3 counters). Position defensively—let enemies come to you. Manage Heat carefully with Heat Sink Sigils and venting.
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Mid Game (Turns 4-6):</strong> Use Forge Fury when Heat is high (convert 5-6 Heat into 8-9 damage burst). Armor-piercing shuts down defensive opponents completely. Unbreakable prevents Component Damage (save for critical hits).
        </p>

        <p class="manuscript-text">
            <strong>Late Game (Turns 7+):</strong> Clan Vengeance should have +4-6 damage by now (devastating). Forge Mastery for burst card draw if needed. Unbreakable Spirit is your safety net (resurrect once at 5 HP). Attrition advantage: you have more HP and damage reduction than any faction.
        </p>
