# Leg Skimming: The Veteran's Sacrifice
## Penance: Casket Control System Extension

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: October 10, 2025

---

## Overview

**"To make room for the machine, we remove what we no longer need."**

Veteran pilots undergo **Leg Skimming** (also called "Shortening," "The Cut," or "Taking the Compact") — surgical amputation of the legs below the knee. This allows:
- **Smaller capsule volume** (shorter pilot = less fluid needed)
- **More space for augmentation ports** (direct neural interfaces beyond just fingers)
- **Reduced metabolic needs** (less body mass = less oxygen, slower exhaustion)
- **Symbolic commitment** (permanent proof of dedication)

**This is optional but common.** After 5-10 missions, most pilots choose it willingly. The benefits are significant. The cost is permanent.

---

## The Procedure

### Surgical Details

**Amputation Specifications**:
- **Location**: Below the knee (tibial amputation, both legs)
- **Anesthesia**: General (unlike First Sync, pilot is unconscious—mercy, not necessity)
- **Duration**: 4-6 hours for both legs
- **Recovery**: 3-4 weeks before re-entering capsule (nerve healing)
- **Prosthetics**: Simple peg-legs for mobility outside Casket (no fancy prosthetics—pilots barely walk anyway)

**What's Removed**:
- Lower legs (shin, ankle, foot)
- Approximately 15-20% of body mass
- 6-8 inches of height
- 20-30% of body's oxygen demand

**What's Added**:
- **Augmentation Ports** in the stumps (secondary neural interfaces, 2-4 ports per stump)
- **Stabilizer mounts** for better capsule suspension (no more ankle sway)
- **Cooling nodes** embedded in stump tissue (dissipate Soulstone heat)
- **Backup control clusters** (if hand threads fail, stumps can take over basic movement)

**Post-Surgery Capsule Modifications**:
- Capsule interior shortened by 8-10 inches (freed vertical space)
- Freed space used for:
  - **Enhanced Soulstone housing** (larger stone OR multiple stones)
  - **Backup oxygen reserves** (longer deployment time before suffocation risk)
  - **Secondary control nodes** (stumps connect to leg servos + auxiliary systems)
  - **Emergency fluid reserves** (if capsule breaches, backup fluid auto-fills)

---

## Gameplay Benefits

### Mechanical Advantages (if pilot undergoes Skimming)

**+1 Soul Point Maximum**
- Light Caskets: 5 → 6 SP
- Medium Caskets: 4 → 5 SP
- Heavy Caskets: 3 → 4 SP
- Assault Caskets: 2 → 3 SP
- *Explanation*: More efficient neural load distribution across augmented stumps

**+2 Heat Capacity**
- Can push 2 additional actions into Danger Zone before Strain Roll
- *Explanation*: Stump cooling nodes dissipate heat more effectively

**+1 Deployment Duration**
- Can stay in capsule 1 hour longer before mandatory disconnect
- *Explanation*: Reduced body mass = reduced oxygen consumption

**New Ability: Stump Override**
- **Once per mission**: Ignore one Thread Snap result (stumps take over control temporarily)
- *Explanation*: Secondary neural ports provide backup motor control
- *Drawback*: -2 to all actions for rest of mission (crude control)

**Improved Thread Recovery**
- After Thread Snap, regain control 1 round faster
- *Explanation*: Backup pathways route around damaged thread

### Mechanical Disadvantages (permanent vulnerabilities)

**Outside Casket Mobility**:
- **Movement Speed Halved** (peg-legs are crude)
- **Cannot Sprint/Run** (fall risk too high)
- **Disadvantage on all Athletics/Acrobatics checks** (balance ruined)
- **Must be carried** to/from capsule during emergencies

**Social Stigma** (faction-dependent):
- Some factions honor it (Church), others pity it (Elves), some mock it (Fae)
- NPCs react differently based on faction culture

**Dependency**:
- **Require assistance** for many daily tasks (carrying supplies, climbing, fleeing danger)
- **Settlement infrastructure matters** (inaccessible bunks = morale penalty)
- **Increased post-mission care time** (+30 minutes stump maintenance)

**Irreversible**:
- Once Skimmed, **cannot be undone**
- Prosthetics don't restore function (peg-legs are mobility aids, not legs)
- If you later regret it, too bad

## Cultural Responses by Faction

### Church of Absolution: **Honored Sacrifice**

**Title**: **"The Shortened"** (reverent)

**Cultural View**:
- Seen as ultimate penance—giving flesh to earn salvation
- Ceremony held after surgery (public, Church bells ring)
- Shortened pilots receive:
  - Better rations (extra meat, fresh water)
  - Softer beds (feather mattresses)
  - Priority healing (priests attend them first)
  - Social respect (even Cardinals bow to Shortened)

**Quote**:
> *"They walked on sinful legs. Now they float in grace. Their sacrifice brings us all closer to Absolution."*

**Pressure**: Church subtly pressures pilots to Skim (not forced, but heavily encouraged after 5 missions)

---

### Elven Remnants: **Tragic Necessity**

**Title**: **"The Pruned"**

**Cultural View**:
- Viewed with sorrow, not honor
- Elves mourn what was lost (legs = connection to earth)
- Understand why it's done (survival demands sacrifice)
- Stumps are carved with memorial runes (names of forests that burned)

**Quote**:
> *"We cut away the dead wood so the tree may live. But each cut reminds us of what the Sundering took from us."*

**Pressure**: None. Elves never suggest Skimming. If pilot chooses it, they're supported, but it's treated as funeral.

---

### Dwarven Clans: **Practical Upgrade**

**Title**: **"Compact Pilots"** (technical term)

**Cultural View**:
- Seen as engineering optimization (remove inefficiency)
- Dwarves build the BEST prosthetics (hydraulic peg-legs, shock-absorbing stumps)
- Skimmed pilots get:
  - Priority forge access (build your own prosthetics)
  - Engineering respect (you optimized yourself)
  - Better contract pay (+10% salary, you're more efficient)

**Quote**:
> *"Less meat, more metal. That's progress. Why carry weight that doesn't help you fight?"*

**Pressure**: Moderate. Dwarven pilots are offered the option at Mission 5 with detailed cost/benefit analysis.

---

### Undead Court: **Already Dead Anyway**

**Title**: **"Efficient Forms"**

**Cultural View**:
- Obvious choice (you don't need legs if you're already dead)
- Some Undead pilots remove MORE (arms, torso, until only skull remains)
- No ceremony, no drama—it's filed as "Maintenance"
- Skimmed Undead pilots often remove stumps entirely (just floating torso)

**Quote**:
> *"Flesh is waste. Remove it. A skull piloting a Casket is perfection."*

**Pressure**: Constant. Undead Court expects all pilots to Skim by Mission 3. Not doing so is seen as "clinging to life."

---

### Fae Courts: **Amusing Commitment**

**Title**: **"Grounded Ones"** (mocking, but affectionate)

**Cultural View**:
- Fae find it both horrifying and fascinating (mortals mutilate themselves for *power*?)
- Fae pilots rarely Skim (prefer to keep bodies intact for aesthetic/social reasons)
- But they respect the *audacity* of it
- Skimmed non-Fae pilots are treated as curiosities (exotic, interesting)

**Quote**:
> *"They cut off their legs to walk better. How delightfully broken. How wonderfully desperate."*

**Pressure**: None. Fae never suggest it. If you choose it, they'll throw you a party (because it's absurd theater).

---

### Nomad Collective: **Survival Calculus**

**Title**: **"Short-Haulers"**

**Cultural View**:
- Viewed pragmatically—does benefit outweigh cost?
- Nomad pilots Skim less often (need mobility in harsh environments—can't outrun storms on peg-legs)
- When they do, it's after careful consideration (written cost/benefit analysis required)
- Collective provides excellent stump care (desert survival medicine is advanced)

**Quote**:
> *"Can't run from sandstorms if you got no legs. But can't run anyway if you're dead. Your call, pilot."*

**Pressure**: None. Purely individual choice. Collective neither encourages nor discourages.

---

### Merchant Guilds: **Premium Service Upgrade**

**Title**: **"Executive Pilots"**

**Cultural View**:
- Seen as sign of serious professional commitment (you invested in yourself)
- Guilds pay premium contracts to Skimmed pilots (+20% salary boost)
- Best prosthetics (gold-trimmed peg-legs, cushioned stumps)
- Best post-op care (private recovery rooms, dedicated nurses)
- Best rehabilitation (physical therapy, psychological counseling)

**Quote**:
> *"You cut off your legs for efficiency? We'll compensate you for that efficiency. Welcome to Executive tier, pilot."*

**Pressure**: High. Guilds WANT you to Skim (more efficient = more profit). They'll pay for surgery if you agree to 5-year contract.

---

### Blighted Packs: **Evolutionary Adaptation**

**Title**: **"Shedders"**

**Cultural View**:
- Some Blighted legs mutate into useless forms (tentacles, backwards joints, fused toes)
- Skimming is both medical necessity AND upgrade
- Stumps often regenerate as something new (not legs, but functional—maybe claws, maybe stabilizer spines)
- Seen as embracing mutation rather than fighting it

**Quote**:
> *"We didn't need those legs anyway. The Void will give us better ones. Or it won't. Either way, we adapt."*

**Pressure**: Variable. If legs are mutating badly, Pack Leaders strongly suggest Skimming. Otherwise, it's personal choice.

---

### Chitinous Ascendancy: **Metamorphosis Stage**

**Title**: **"Pupae"**

**Cultural View**:
- Skimming is seen as molting—shedding inferior human form
- Skimmed Ascendancy pilots often grow chitin plates over stumps (natural armor)
- Hive views it as progress toward perfect form (less human = closer to ascension)
- Some Ascendancy pilots never leave capsules after Skimming (permanent fusion)

**Quote**:
> *"Legs are for crawling. We have transcended crawling. Shed the flesh. Join the hive fully."*

**Pressure**: Extreme. Ascendancy expects ALL pilots to Skim by Mission 5. Refusing is seen as rejecting evolution.

---

## Timing and Player Choice

### When Do Pilots Choose Skimming?

**Rookie Pilots (0-5 missions)**:
- Almost never voluntarily
- Still adjusting to capsule trauma, not ready for more
- Need to prove they'll survive before committing
- Exception: Undead and Chitinous factions may Skim immediately (cultural pressure)

**Experienced Pilots (5-15 missions)**:
- Most common window for Skimming
- Pilot has survived long enough to see the value
- Body is already scarred/damaged (why not optimize?)
- Peer pressure from veteran pilots ("Join us")
- Benefits become obvious (watching Skimmed pilots deploy longer/harder)

**Veteran Pilots (15+ missions)**:
- If they haven't Skimmed yet, they probably won't
- Either philosophically opposed OR their build doesn't benefit from it
- Or they're too addicted to capsule to care about optimization (just want to pilot)
- Or they've seen Skimmed pilots die and don't want to risk it

### Campaign Event: The Offer

**After Mission 5** (or when player reaches 5 total missions):

> **Surgeon NPC approaches pilot in settlement:**
>
> "You've survived five drops. That's more than most. You're good at this.
>
> I can make you better.
>
> Leg Skimming. I've done it 200 times. Three-week recovery, then you're back in the capsule with +1 SP, longer deployments, better heat management.
>
> Cost: 50 Credits, 1 Medical Supply. And your legs, obviously.
>
> Think about it. Other pilots will tell you it's worth it. Some will tell you it ruined them.
>
> Your choice. No pressure. Well, maybe a little pressure. [Faction-specific pressure applies here]
>
> What do you say?"

**Player chooses**:
- **Accept**: Surgery happens (cutscene/narrative moment), gain benefits + vulnerabilities, 3-week downtime
- **Decline**: Keep legs, offer appears again at Mission 10, 15, 20 (can always change mind later)

**Once chosen, cannot be reversed.**

## Downtime: Caring for Skimmed Pilots

### Post-Mission Care Requirements

**Stump Maintenance** (30 minutes after each deployment):
1. **Remove augmentation port covers** (twist-lock seals)
2. **Flush ports with saline solution** (prevent infection)
3. **Inspect for neural feedback burns** (thread overload damage)
4. **Apply anti-inflammatory salve** (reduce swelling)
5. **Replace cooling gel packs** (embedded in stump tissue)
6. **Massage stumps** (prevent nerve calcification)
7. **Re-seal ports** (surgical-grade silicone caps)

**If maintenance skipped**: Roll 1d6
- 1-2: Infection (pilot takes 1d6 damage, cannot deploy next mission)
- 3-4: Port fouling (-1 to all Casket actions next mission)
- 5-6: No immediate consequence (but long-term risk increases)

### Enhanced Recovery Needs

**Daily Life as Skimmed Pilot**:
- **Require assistance getting in/out of capsule** (can't climb ladder with peg-legs)
- **Need wheelchair or crutches** between capsule bay and living quarters
- **Can't carry own food** (eat at communal tables, rely on others)
- **Sleep in specially modified bunks** (stump elevation to prevent swelling)
- **Bathing requires assistance** (fall risk in showers)
- **Cannot flee emergencies** (if settlement attacked, must be evacuated by others)

**Social Dynamics**:
- Skimmed pilots become **dependent on settlement infrastructure**
- Form tight bonds with other Skimmed (shared trauma, mutual assistance)
- Non-Skimmed pilots may resent special treatment ("We don't get feather beds")
- Romantic relationships complicated (body image issues, physical dependency)
- Veterans who refuse Skimming are sometimes ostracized by Skimmed pilots ("Why won't you join us?")

### Campaign Mechanic: Pilot Morale

**Morale Modifiers for Skimmed Pilots**:

| Settlement Infrastructure | Morale Modifier |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Barracks only (Tier 1) | -2 (no accessibility, constant pain) |
| Infirmary (Tier 2) | +1 (medical care, accessible bunks) |
| Augmentation Clinic (Tier 3) | +2 (expert care, rehabilitation) |
| Pilot Sanctuary (Tier 4) | +3 (luxury, dedicated attendants) |

| Event | Morale Modifier |
|-------|-----------------|
| Stump maintenance skipped | -3 (pain, risk of infection) |
| Another pilot chooses Skimming | +1 (peer validation) |
| Skimmed pilot dies in mission | -2 (doubt, fear) |
| Non-Skimmed pilot mocks them | -1 (humiliation) |
| Romantic partner accepts them | +2 (acceptance, love) |

**Morale Effects on Gameplay**:
- **High Morale (6+)**: +1 to all Casket actions (motivated, focused)
- **Neutral Morale (3-5)**: No effect
- **Low Morale (0-2)**: -1 to all Casket actions (distracted, depressed)
- **Broken Morale (-1 or lower)**: Refuses to deploy (must spend downtime recovering)

## Extreme Cases: Full Reduction

### "The Torso" (unofficial term for pilots who remove EVERYTHING)

Some pilots go beyond Skimming. They remove:
- **Arms** (don't need them in death pose anyway—threads connect directly to shoulder stumps)
- **Legs** (already gone from Skimming)
- Only **head, neck, spine, and torso** remain
- Threads connect directly to **spinal column** (no hands needed)

**Appearance**:
- Floating limbless torso in capsule
- Threads emerge from vertebrae like cables
- Head often partially shaved (cranial ports added)
- Breathing tube is permanent (can't survive outside capsule without life support)

**Benefits**:
- **+3 SP Maximum** (instead of +1 from Skimming)
- **+4 Heat Capacity** (instead of +2)
- **+3 Deployment Duration** (can stay in capsule for days)
- **Immune to all limb-based Scars** (no arms/legs to damage)
- **Cannot be pulled from capsule** (fully integrated—disconnection = death)

**Costs**:
- **Total dependency** outside Casket (must be carried, fed, bathed by dedicated attendant)
- **Cannot leave capsule for more than 1 hour** (life support dependency)
- **Extreme psychological trauma** (body dysmorphia, suicidal ideation, dissociation)
- **Social isolation** (even other Skimmed pilots find it disturbing)
- **Irreversible and Fatal** (once done, pilot lives in capsule until death)
- **Morale permanently locked at 0** (broken, but functional)

**Frequency**: Extremely rare (maybe 1 in 500 pilots reach this point)

**Why Anyone Would Do This**:
- Desperation (only way to pilot after catastrophic injury)
- Addiction (can't bear to leave capsule anymore)
- Fanaticism (ultimate sacrifice for faction)
- Pragmatism (war needs pilots, and this makes you the best pilot)

**Cultural Responses**:

| Faction | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Church** | *"They have transcended flesh entirely. Saints among us."* (revere them as living martyrs) |
| **Elves** | *"This is what the Sundering has reduced us to. A horror."* (mourn them as lost souls) |
| **Dwarves** | *"Took optimization too far. That's not engineering, that's madness."* (won't perform the surgery) |
| **Undead** | *"Efficient. We approve."* (fully support it, encourage it) |
| **Fae** | *"Magnificent tragedy. We'll watch them until they break completely."* (fascinated) |
| **Nomads** | *"That's not surviving. That's just existing."* (pity them) |
| **Merchants** | *"Not profitable. Can't transfer to new Casket if current one destroyed."* (discourage it) |
| **Blighted** | *"They shed everything. Are they still human? Do they care?"* (philosophical) |
| **Chitinous** | *"Perfect. They are one with the machine. The hive welcomes them."* (celebrate it) |

**Gameplay Note**: The Torso is an **endgame state**, not a mid-campaign choice. Only offer it:
- After 20+ missions
- If pilot has maxed-out Capsule Addiction
- If pilot has lost multiple limbs to injuries and surgery is "rebuilding" them

## Narrative Moments

### After First Skimming

> You wake in the Infirmary. The drugs are wearing off. Your legs are gone.
>
> No—not gone. You can still feel them. Your toes wiggle. Your calves itch. But when you look down, there are only bandaged stumps.
>
> The surgeon stands over you, wiping blood off her instruments. "Clean cut. Augmentation ports installed. You'll deploy 20% more efficiently now."
>
> She says it like it's nothing. Like legs are just parts you swap out.
>
> You try to sit up. Pain shoots through your stumps—phantom pain from nerves that no longer connect to anything. You gasp.
>
> "Normal," the surgeon says. "It'll hurt for a month. Then it'll hurt less. Then it'll just be numb."
>
> She gestures to the ward. Three other pilots lie in beds, all Shortened. They watch you with hollow eyes. One nods slowly.
>
> You're one of them now.
>
> Someone brings you crutches. They're worn smooth by other hands. How many pilots used these before you? How many died still wearing them?
>
> How many *forgot they ever had legs at all*?

---

### Veteran Pilot Advice (NPC Dialogue)

> **Conversation with Veteran Skimmed Pilot**:
>
> "Kid, I'm gonna be straight with you. The Skimming hurts. Not the surgery—they knock you out for that—the *after* hurts.
>
> You'll wake up and try to stand, and you'll fall. Every time. For weeks. You'll reach for legs that aren't there. You'll hate yourself.
>
> You'll need help getting dressed. Help getting to the bathroom. Help getting into your rack at night. You'll feel useless.
>
> But then you get back in the capsule.
>
> And suddenly you're *better*. Faster. Stronger. You'll pilot for an extra hour before the exhaustion hits. You'll push into the Danger Zone and your Casket won't scream. You'll dance that 12-ton war machine like it's part of you.
>
> You'll float in that fluid, stumps where your legs were, threads pulling at nothing, and you'll think:
>
> *This is what I was always meant to be.*
>
> And that's when you'll know you made the right choice.
>
> Or the worst mistake of your life.
>
> Honestly? Both.
>
> The Skimming doesn't just take your legs, kid. It takes the *idea* that you were ever whole. You'll never walk right again. You'll never run. You'll never dance, never climb, never feel sand between your toes.
>
> But you'll pilot better than you ever dreamed.
>
> So ask yourself: What matters more? The body you had, or the machine you'll become?"

**END OF DOCUMENT**

*"I gave my legs to the machine. The machine gave me power. Now I float in darkness, pulling strings I can barely feel, and I wonder: Did I make a trade? Or did I just lose?"*
