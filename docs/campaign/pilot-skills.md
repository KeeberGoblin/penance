# Pilot Skills System

*Optional Campaign Rule • Adds pilot progression and specialization*

## Overview

Pilot Skills represent the accumulated combat experience, natural talent, and hard-won expertise of a Casket pilot. As pilots survive missions and grow in skill, they unlock powerful abilities that can shift the tide of battle.

**This is an optional campaign rule.** It adds progression depth but increases complexity. Skip this system for simpler campaigns.

## Settlement Phase Training

During the **Settlement Phase**, you may spend resources to train pilots:

### Training Action
**Cost:** 50 Credits per session
**Effect:** Choose one pilot. They gain **+50 XP**.

**Trade-Off:** You can only perform **one Settlement action per phase**. Training means you cannot Repair, Recruit, or Trade this phase.

---

## Flesh Bargain Integration

The **Flesh Bargain** can grant skills as alternative rewards:

### Example Bargain: "The Veteran's Edge"
**Cost:** -4 Max HP (permanent)
**Reward:** Gain one **Tier 2 skill** immediately (ignore XP requirement)

**GM Note:** Use Flesh Bargain skill rewards sparingly. They should feel powerful but costly.

---

## Pilot Death and Skill Loss

When a pilot **dies permanently** (Casket destroyed, failed death save, etc.):
- All skills are lost
- No XP carries over to new recruits
- Veteran pilot death should be meaningful and painful

**Optional Rule - Mentorship:**
If a veteran pilot (2+ skills) dies, their **highest-tier skill** can be passed to one other pilot in the roster as a "legacy."

---

## Balancing Guidelines for GMs

### Skill Power Budget
- **Tier 1:** +5-10% combat effectiveness
- **Tier 2:** +15-25% combat effectiveness
- **Tier 3:** +30-50% combat effectiveness

### Anti-Snowball Measures
1. **Max 3 skills** prevents power creep
2. **Permadeath** makes veteran pilots valuable but mortal
3. **Resource costs** (training) create economic pressure
4. **Enemy escalation:** Veterans face harder missions

### Difficulty Scaling
When players have skilled pilots:
- Increase enemy numbers by 10-20%
- Give enemies 1-2 skills of their own
- Add environmental hazards
- Use more boss-tier enemies

---

## Optional Rules

### Variant: Injury-Based Skill Loss
When a pilot **survives but takes serious injury** (3+ components destroyed in one mission):
- Roll 1d6
- On **1-2**: Lose one random skill permanently (trauma)

### Variant: Scar-Based Skill Acquisition
Instead of XP, pilots gain skills through **narrative events**:
- "Survived 3 missions with Head ≤2 HP" → **Headhunter**
- "Destroyed 5+ enemies with Bleed" → **Thornvine Mastery**
- "Used Salvage 10+ times" → **Scrap Scrounger**

Track achievements, unlock skills organically.

## Designer's Notes

Pilot Skills add **progression depth** to campaigns, making veteran pilots feel distinct and powerful. However, they also create **snowball risk** (veterans get stronger while rookies stay weak) and **loss aversion** (players fear permadeath more).

**Use this system when:**
- Players want RPG-style character progression
- Campaigns will run 10+ missions
- Permadeath is accepted as part of the experience

**Skip this system when:**
- Players prefer tactical purity over progression
- Campaigns are short (1-5 missions)
- You want to minimize bookkeeping

Pilot skills work best when integrated with **Flesh Bargain** (HP-for-power trades) and **Settlement Phase Training** (resource management). They should feel **earned through blood**, not handed out freely.
