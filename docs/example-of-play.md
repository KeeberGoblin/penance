- SP: 3
- Heat: 2 (Strain +1 if Danger Zone)
- Defense: +2 (Fortress Stance passive, Guardian's Defiance expired)

---

**Grom's Plan**: "Kara is 1 hex away (D4, elevated). I'm adjacent diagonally. Daggers are melee, she might attack me. I'll close distance and attack first!"

---

**Action 1**: Move to D4? **NO, occupied by Kara.**

**Revised Plan**: "I'll attack from E5. Wait, my warhammer is melee. I need to be adjacent. D4 is adjacent to E5! I can attack!"

---

**Action 1**: Play **Crushing Descent** (Warhammer)
- **SP Cost**: 2 SP
- **Effect**: Deal 5 damage, ignore 1 Defense
- **Range**: Melee (E5 is adjacent to D4 ✓)
- **Target**: Kara at D4
- **Facing Check**: Grom is at E5, Kara is at D4. From Kara's perspective, E5 is to her South-East. That's facing [3] (Back-Right side attack).

**Kara's Perspective Facings**:
```
Kara at D4, facing SE:
      [1] Front (SE direction)
  [6]  ▲  [2]
       █
  [5]     [3]  <- Grom is here (E5)
      [4]
```

**Side Attack** (not front, not rear, Side = facing 3)

---

**Kara's Defense Response**:
- **Shield?** No shield equipped (dual daggers)
- **Base Defense**: 0
- **Elevated hex**: +1 Defense (Kara is on higher ground)
- **Side attack**: Standard Defense (no penalty, no shield)
- **Play reactive card?** Kara has Unyielding Bulwark in hand!

**Kara declares**: "I play **Unyielding Bulwark** (reactive defense)!"
- **Effect**: Reduce damage by 3, then discard 1 random card from hand

**Hit Roll**:
- Melee = Auto-hit (no roll needed)

**Damage Calculation**:
- Base damage: 5
- Ignore 1 Defense (Crushing Descent effect): Kara's Defense is 0 + 1 (elevation) = 1, ignored
- Unyielding Bulwark: -3 damage
- **Final damage**: 5 - 3 = **2 damage**

**Kara's Damage Resolution**:
- Discard 2 cards (Kara chooses): Discards Soul's Recall and Evasive Strike from hand
- Unyielding Bulwark effect: Discard 1 additional random card. **Roll 1d4** (4 cards left in hand): Rolls 3 = Discards Ironstrider's Rush

**Total cards discarded**: 3 (2 from damage, 1 from Bulwark cost)

**Kara's Hand Now**: Quick Stab, Second Skin (2 cards)

---

**Grom continues**:
- **SP Spent**: 2/3
- **Heat**: 2

---

**Action 2**: Play **Reinforced Hull** (Ablative Plating relic)

- **Heat**: 2
- **Draw 1 card**: Draws Protective Advance

**Grom's Defense now**: +2 (Fortress Stance) + 2 (Reinforced Hull) = **+4 Defense** until end of round

---

**Grom passes turn** (out of SP).

**End of Turn**:
- Stayed in Safe Zone (3/3 SP), no Strain roll
- Draw back to 6 cards: Draws 4 more cards (now has 6-card hand)

**Final Position**: E5, facing West, Heat 2, Defense +4

---

### Kara's Turn (Round 2)

**Current State**:
- Position: D4 (elevated), facing SE
- Hand: Quick Stab, Second Skin (2 cards only!)
- Deck: 22 - 6 (starting hand) - 3 (discarded) - 2 (in hand) = **11 cards left in deck**
- SP: 5
- Heat: 2 (Strain +1 if Danger Zone)

---

**Kara's Plan**: "I took 2 damage (discarded 3 cards with Bulwark cost). Grom is adjacent, I can attack! Vow of Wrath forces me to attack if able. I have Quick Stab (1 SP, 2 damage). But Grom has +4 Defense... my 2 damage won't get through. I need more damage!"

**Draw back to hand size first**: Draws 4 cards: Aerial Leap, Flurry of Cuts, Desperate Lunge, Heat Sink

**Current Hand**: Quick Stab, Second Skin, Aerial Leap, Flurry of Cuts, Desperate Lunge, Heat Sink (6 cards)

---

**Action 1**: Play **Quick Stab** (Dagger, Right Arm)
- **SP Cost**: 1 SP
- **Effect**: Deal 2 damage, melee
- **Target**: Grom at E5 (adjacent ✓)
- **Facing**: Kara is at D4, Grom is at E5. From Grom's perspective (facing West), Kara is to his Front-Left (facing [6]).

**Grom's Facings** (facing West):
```
      [1] Front (West)
  [6]  ▲  [2]
       █      <- Grom
  [5]     [3]
      [4]

Kara is at D4 (North-West of Grom) = Facing [6] Front-Left
```

**Front Attack** (Grom's shield covers front arc!)

---

**Grom's Defense**:
- Base Defense: 0
- Fortress Stance (passive): +2 (front arc active!)
- Reinforced Hull: +2
- **Total Defense: +4**

**Hit Roll**:
- Melee = Auto-hit

**Damage Calculation**:
- Base damage: 2
- Vow of Wrath: +1 damage (Kara's racial bonus)
- **Total damage before Defense**: 3
- Grom's Defense: 4
- **Final damage**: 3 - 4 = -1 → **Minimum 1 damage** (always deal at least 1)

**Grom discards 1 card** (from hand or deck, Grom chooses): Discards Breathe the Core from hand.

---

**Kara continues**:
- **SP Spent**: 1/5
- **Heat**: 2
- **Draw 1 card**: Draws Unyielding Bulwark

---

**Action 2**: Play **Flurry of Cuts** (Dagger, Left Arm)
- **SP Cost**: 2 SP
- **Effect**: Deal 1 damage 3 times (resolved separately)
- **Target**: Grom at E5

**Damage Calculation** (per hit):
- Base damage: 1
- Vow of Wrath: +1
- **Total**: 2 damage per hit
- Grom's Defense: 4
- **Final per hit**: 2 - 4 = -2 → **Minimum 1 damage each**

**Total damage**: 1 × 3 = **3 damage**

**Grom discards 3 cards** (chooses to mill from deck to keep hand):
- Mills 3 cards from deck

---

**Kara continues**:
- **SP Spent**: 3/5
- **Heat**: 2
- **Draw 1 card**: Draws Warden's Pivot

---

**Kara considers**: "I've dealt 4 damage total (1 + 3). I have 2 SP left. Grom still has high Defense. I could push into Danger Zone (+2 SP = 7 SP total), but I'd risk Strain roll with 2 Heat (+1 penalty). Should I?"

**Decision**: "I'll play it safe. Grom's Defense expires at end of round. I'll wait."

**Kara passes turn**.

**End of Turn**:
- Stayed in Safe Zone (3/5 SP used), no Strain roll
- Draw back to 6 cards: Draws 3 more cards

**Final Position**: D4 (elevated), facing SE, Heat 2

---

### End Phase (Round 2)

- Grom's Reinforced Hull (+2 Defense) expires
- Grom's Defense now: +2 (Fortress Stance passive only)
- Victory check: Both alive, continue

**Damage Totals**:
- Kara: Discarded 3 cards (2 from damage, 1 from Bulwark cost) = **19 cards left** (11 deck + 6 hand + 2 discard)
- Grom: Discarded 4 cards (1 + 3) = **24 cards left** (28 - 4)

---

## Round 3

### Initiative Phase

**Kara rolls**: 1d6 = 6 (+1) = **7**
**Grom rolls**: 1d6 = 1 (-1) = **0**

**Kara goes first!**

---

### Kara's Turn (Round 3)

**Current State**:
- Position: D4, facing SE
- Hand: Quick Stab, Warden's Pivot, Desperate Lunge, Aerial Leap, Second Skin, Guardian's Defiance
- SP: 5
- Heat: 2

---

**Kara's Plan**: "Grom's Defense is only +2 now (Reinforced Hull expired). I can deal real damage! I'll go into Danger Zone for +2 SP and unleash everything!"

---

**Action 1**: Play **Desperate Lunge** (Universal)
- **SP Cost**: 1 SP
- **Effect**: Move 2 hexes, rotate once, +1 Heat
- **Choice**: Move to E4 (adjacent to Grom from different angle)
- **New facing**: Check, Grom is now at E5, Kara at E4. From Grom's perspective (facing West), E4 is directly West = Facing [1] Front.

**Wait, Kara wants REAR attack** (+2 damage bonus!)

**Revised Action**: Move D4 → E5? **NO, occupied!**

**Better plan**: Move around via D5 → E6 to get behind Grom!

**Revised Move**: D4 → D5 → E6 (now behind Grom!)

**From Grom's perspective** (facing West), E6 is East = Facing [4] **REAR!**

- **SP Spent**: 1/5
- **Heat**: 2 + 1 = **3 Heat**
- **Draw**: Guardian's Defiance (duplicate)

---

**Action 2**: Play **Quick Stab** (Dagger)
- **SP Cost**: 1 SP
- **Rear attack!** (+2 damage)
- **Target**: Grom at E5

**Grom's Defense**:
- Rear attack: -2 Defense
- Fortress Stance: +2 (but shields don't protect rear!)
- **Total Defense**: 0 + 2 - 2 = **0 Defense** (shield negated by rear attack!)

**Damage**:
- Base: 2
- Vow of Wrath: +1
- Rear attack: +2
- **Total**: 5 damage
- Defense: 0
- **Final: 5 damage!**

**Grom discards 5 cards!** (Mills from deck)

---

**Kara continues**:
- **SP Spent**: 2/5
- **Heat**: 3 (Strain +1)
- **Draw**: Flurry of Cuts

---

**Action 3**: Play **Flurry of Cuts** (Dagger)
- **SP Cost**: 2 SP
- **Rear attack!** (+2 damage per hit)

**Damage per hit**:
- Base: 1
- Vow of Wrath: +1
- Rear: +2
- **Total**: 4 damage × 3 hits = **12 damage!**
- Defense: 0
- **Final: 12 damage!**

**Grom discards 12 cards!**

---

**Kara continues**:
- **SP Spent**: 4/5
- **Heat**: 3
- **Draw**: Breathe the Core

---

**Kara calculates**: "I've dealt 17 damage this turn! Grom started with 28 cards, took 4 damage last round = 24 cards. Now -17 = **7 cards left!** I'm at 4/5 SP. Should I push Danger Zone for +2 SP?"

**Decision**: "YES! One more attack might finish him!"

**Entering Danger Zone**: +2 SP (total 7 SP max)

**Action 4**: Play **Quick Stab** again? **WAIT, already played it!** Each card can only be played once per turn!

**Available attacks in hand**: None! (Flurry and Quick Stab already played)

**Kara frustrated**: "I can't attack again! I'll pass."

---

**Kara passes turn**.

**End of Turn**:
- **Entered Danger Zone** (4/5 Safe, pushed to 4 SP total—wait, that's IN Safe Zone!)
- Actually, Kara spent 4 SP, which is within Safe Zone for Scout (5 SP)! **NO Strain roll needed!**

**Correction**: Kara did NOT enter Danger Zone! (Danger Zone is 6-7 SP for Scout)

---

### Grom's Turn (Round 3)

**Current State**:
- Position: E5, facing West
- Cards remaining: 28 - 4 (Round 2) - 5 - 12 (Round 3) = **7 cards total**
- Hand: 5 cards (had 6, discarded 1 earlier)
- Deck: 2 cards (7 total - 5 in hand)
- SP: 3
- Heat: 2

---

**Grom's Plan**: "I'm at 7 cards left (5 hand + 2 deck). Kara dealt massive damage. I need to fight back or flee. But Kara's behind me! I'll rotate and attack!"

---

**Action 1**: Play **Warden's Pivot** (if in hand... checking)
- **Not in hand!** Grom's hand: Crushing Descent (already played), Shield Wall, Protective Advance, Hammerfall, Defensive Swing, Full Diagnostic

**Available**: Hammerfall (3 SP, 6 damage, can't move next turn)

**Action 1**: Play **Hammerfall** (Warhammer)
- **SP Cost**: 3 SP (ALL SP!)
- **Effect**: Deal 6 damage, cannot move next turn
- **Target**: Kara at E6

**Facing Check**: Grom at E5 facing West, Kara at E6 (East of Grom) = Rear of Grom.

**Wait, can Grom attack behind him?**

**Melee range = adjacent**, Kara is adjacent. But Grom is facing West, Kara is East (behind).

**Rules question**: Can you melee attack from any facing, or only front arc?

**Ruling**: **Melee attacks can target any adjacent hex** (you swing around). Facing only matters for DEFENSE, not offense!

**Grom attacks Kara**!

**Kara's Defense**:
- Grom is attacking from E5, Kara is at E6 facing SE
- From Kara's perspective, E5 is West = Facing [6] (Front-Left, side attack)
- **Front-ish attack** (no rear bonus for Grom)

**Kara's Defense**:
- Base: 0
- Elevated: Kara left elevated hex (moved to E6, not elevated)
- **Total: 0 Defense**

**Kara's Reactive**:
- Has Second Skin (-1 damage) in hand!

**Kara plays Second Skin**!

**Damage**:
- Base: 6
- Second Skin: -1
- **Final: 5 damage**

**Kara discards 5 cards** (from hand: 5, or split hand/deck)

---

**Grom passes** (out of SP).

**End of Turn**:
- Grom: 7 cards → **2 cards left** (5 in hand - played 1 - draw 1 = 5, deck has 2)

**Wait, hand calculation**:
- Started turn with 5 in hand
- Played Hammerfall
- Drew 1 card after playing
- **Hand: 5 cards**, Deck: 2 cards, **Total: 7 cards left**

---

## Round 4 (Climax)

### Initiative

**Kara rolls**: 4 (+1) = **5**
**Grom rolls**: 6 (-1) = **5**

**TIE!** Re-roll!

**Kara**: 3 (+1) = **4**
**Grom**: 2 (-1) = **1**

**Kara goes first!**

---

### Kara's Turn (Round 4)

**Current State**:
- Cards: 19 - 5 (damage taken) = **14 cards** (deck + hand)
- SP: 5
- Heat: 3
- Hand: Likely has attacks remaining

**Kara attacks**: "Grom has 7 cards left. I can finish this!"

**Plays attack cards, deals 7+ damage**

**Grom reduced to 0 cards** → **Casket Disabled!**

---

## Victory!

**Kara wins!** Grom's Ironheart Bastion is disabled.

---

## Post-Game Analysis

### Key Moments

1. **Round 1**: Kara claimed elevated hex early (good positioning)
2. **Round 2**: Grom's high Defense (+4) negated most of Kara's attacks
3. **Round 3**: Kara flanked for rear attacks (+2 damage) = devastating!
4. **Facing matters**: Rear attacks dealt 17 damage vs 4 damage from front attacks

### Lessons Learned

**For Kara (Scout)**:
- ✓ Mobility won the match (Jump Jets → flank → rear attack)
- ✓ Vow of Wrath (+1 damage) added up over multiple attacks
- ✗ Should have vented Heat earlier (didn't use Emergency Vents)
- ✗ Drew some cards but didn't use all tools

**For Grom (Heavy)**:
- ✓ High Defense (Guardian's Defiance, Reinforced Hull) delayed defeat
- ✗ Didn't rotate to protect rear (vulnerable to flanking)
- ✗ Didn't use Repair Kit (could have removed Kara's damage cards... wait, can't target enemy!)
- ✗ Should have claimed elevated hex first (slow movement was weakness)

---

## Takeaways for New Players

1. **Facing is critical** - Rear attacks are +2 damage AND -2 Defense (huge swing!)
2. **Terrain matters** - Elevated hex gave Kara +1 Defense early
3. **Mobility wins** - Scout's Jump Jets allowed flanking
4. **Defense delays death** - Grom survived 2 rounds due to high Defense
5. **SP management** - Kara stayed in Safe Zone (no Strain rolls = no risk)

---

*"And thus, Kara earned redemption in iron and blood. Grom fell, but will rise again in the Workshop."*
