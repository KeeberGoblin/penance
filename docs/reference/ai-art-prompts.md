# AI Art Prompts for Casket Design
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: October 10, 2025

## Style Direction: Baroque-Romanticist Brutalism

**Core Aesthetic Fusion**:
- **Baroque**: Ornate religious iconography, dramatic lighting, flowing fabric details, gilded accents
- **Romanticist**: Dark atmosphere, sublime terror, gothic architecture elements, emphasis on emotion/tragedy
- **Brutalist**: Raw concrete/metal forms, geometric shapes, exposed structure, functional ugliness

**Think**:
- Caravaggio's chiaroscuro lighting on a Soviet war monument
- Gothic cathedral gargoyles welded onto industrial machinery
- Bernini sculptures made of riveted steel plates
- Francisco Goya's Black Paintings but it's a mech

## Unified Style Notes

**Lighting**:
- Always use dramatic chiaroscuro (strong light/shadow contrast)
- Light source should tell story (forge fire = dwarves, moonlight = undead, forest canopy = elves)
- Shadows as important as lit areas

**Texture**:
- Weathering is essential (rust, scratches, wear)
- Materials should feel HEAVY (metal has weight, not floaty sci-fi)
- Layered details (ornate over brutalist, not blended)

**Scale Reference**:
- Include environmental context for size
- Show weight through stance (sinking slightly into ground, bent terrain)
- Heavy shadows cast by mass

**Color Palette**:
- Dark base (blacks, deep grays, dark browns)
- Accent colors muted (oxidized metals, dried blood, tarnished gold)
- No bright/neon/glowing unless narrative reason (forge fire, necromancy, bioluminescence)

**Mood**:
- Tragic grandeur
- Functional horror
- Beautiful brutality
- Sublime dread

## Technical Tips for AI Generation

**For Midjourney**:
- Use `--ar 2:3` for portrait orientation (shows full Casket)
- Add `--stylize 750` for more artistic interpretation
- Add `--chaos 30` for variation while keeping prompt
- Use `--v 6` for latest model

**For Stable Diffusion**:
- Use "oil painting" and "chiaroscuro" for style
- Add "volumetric lighting" for atmosphere
- Use "8k" and "highly detailed" for quality
- ControlNet with pose reference helps consistency

**For DALL-E 3**:
- More verbose descriptions work better
- Specify "dark palette" explicitly
- Add "in the style of Caravaggio meets HR Giger" for fusion aesthetic

**Iteration Strategy**:
1. Generate base form (get silhouette right)
2. Add faction-specific details (iconography, materials)
3. Refine lighting and mood
4. Add environmental context last

**Elves**: Wood, bone, nature reclaiming, moss, roots, tragic decay
**Dwarves**: Runes, rivets, modular, functional, clan marks, forge glow
**Undead**: Bones, tombs, necromancy, cold light, death imagery, purple/blue glow
