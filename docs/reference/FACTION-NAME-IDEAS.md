# Faction Name Alternatives

## Issue
Two factions end with "Courts" which creates confusion:
- **Undead Court**
- **Fae Courts**

## Suggested Alternatives

### For "Undead Court" →

1. **The Cadaver Assemblage**
   - Emphasizes scientific/necromantic research
   - "Assemblage" suggests both gathering and construction

2. **The Lichdom**
   - Direct, powerful, implies immortal rulers
   - Shorter, more memorable

3. **The Sepulchral Compact**
   - Formal, treaty-bound undead alliance
   - "Sepulchral" evokes tombs and death

4. **The Ossuarium**
   - Derived from ossuary (bone repository)
   - Unique, gothic, architecturally evocative

5. **The Necrocracy**
   - Rule by the dead
   - Clean, descriptive portmanteau

### For "Fae Courts" →

1. **The Wyrd Conclave**
   - "Wyrd" = fate/destiny (Old English)
   - Maintains otherworldly feel

2. **The Twilight Compact**
   - Emphasizes their liminal nature
   - "Compact" suggests binding agreements

3. **The Dreaming Accord**
   - References fae connection to dreams/unreality
   - Less formal than "court"

4. **The Sídhe Dominion**
   - "Sídhe" (pronounced "shee") = Irish fae folk
   - More specific cultural root

5. **The Glamour Coterie**
   - "Glamour" = fae illusion magic
   - "Coterie" = exclusive group

## Recommended Pairings

### Option A: Formal/Political
- **The Lichdom** (Undead)
- **The Sídhe Dominion** (Fae)

### Option B: Mystical/Evocative
- **The Ossuarium** (Undead)
- **The Wyrd Conclave** (Fae)

### Option C: Thematic Unity
- **The Sepulchral Compact** (Undead)
- **The Twilight Compact** (Fae)
- Both end with "Compact" - emphasizes alliance/treaty theme
