## Overview: The Capsule

**Caskets are not worn. They are piloted.**

Inside every Casket's chassis is a **Control Capsule**—a coffin-sized chamber filled with viscous **Neural Fluid** (harvested from Soulstone proximity). The pilot does not stand or sit. They are **suspended**, floating in darkness, arms bound across their chest in a mummy's death pose.

From each fingertip extends a **Neural Thread** (also called "puppet strings" or "veins"). These bio-mechanical tendrils connect to the Casket's motor control nodes—shoulders, elbows, knees, weapon mounts. The pilot manipulates the Casket like a marionette, but from *inside* the puppet.

---

## Physical Configuration

### The Capsule Chamber

**Location**: Core chassis, heavily armored (the most protected part of the Casket)

**Dimensions**:
- 7 feet tall × 3 feet wide × 2 feet deep
- Barely enough space for a human body
- Claustrophobic by design (prevents movement that could snap threads)

**Interior**:
- Filled with **Neural Fluid**—thick, translucent amber liquid
- Faint Soulstone glow (bioluminescence from dissolved crystal particles)
- Temperature: 98.6°F (body temperature maintained)
- Pilot breathes through a mask/rebreather connected to oxygen reserves
- Total sensory deprivation except for Neural Thread feedback

### The Pilot's Position

**Binding Pose**:
- Arms crossed over chest (left over right, or right over left depending on preference)
- Wrists bound with leather straps to prevent flailing
- Legs secured straight, ankles locked (or stumps secured, for veteran pilots who have undergone Leg Skimming)
- Head restrained with a collar brace (prevents whiplash during impacts)
- Body suspended by harness, floating in fluid

**Note**: Veteran pilots often undergo **Leg Skimming** (amputation below the knee) to optimize capsule performance. See **[leg-skimming-system.md](leg-skimming-system.md)** for complete details on this optional but common procedure.

**Why This Position?**
- **Immobilization prevents thread damage**: Any sudden movement risks tearing the Neural Threads from fingertips
- **Psychological control**: The death pose is a constant reminder—you are already dead
- **Safety**: If pilot panics and thrashes, they can't accidentally command the Casket to self-destruct
- **Tradition**: First Remnants were found in this position, arms crossed, as if buried. It became standard.

## Neural Threads: The Puppet Strings

### Physical Properties

**Material**:
- Bio-mechanical hybrid—part nerve tissue, part crystalline fiber
- Grown from Soulstone exposure to human nervous tissue
- Cannot be manufactured; must be *cultivated* from each pilot's own neurons

**Appearance**:
- Translucent silver-white
- Diameter: 2mm (about as thick as a guitar string)
- Length: 4-6 feet from fingertip to Casket control node
- Glow faintly in darkness
- When under strain, they vibrate and hum at audible frequencies

**Attachment Points**:
- **Fingertips**: Threads pierce through the nail beds and anchor to bone
- **Exit Point**: Each finger has one thread (10 threads total per pilot)
- **Installation**: Surgically implanted during "First Sync" ceremony
- **Permanence**: Once installed, threads cannot be safely removed (cutting them causes permanent nerve damage)

### Control Mapping

Each finger controls specific Casket functions:

**Right Hand (Motor Control)**:
- **Thumb**: Right Arm (weapon/tool)
- **Index**: Head/Torso Rotation
- **Middle**: Right Leg
- **Ring**: Left Leg
- **Pinky**: Stance/Balance Adjustment

**Left Hand (Auxiliary Control)**:
- **Thumb**: Left Arm (weapon/shield)
- **Index**: Sensor Array/Targeting
- **Middle**: Power Distribution (Soulstone throttle)
- **Ring**: Defense Systems (shields/parry)
- **Pinky**: Communication/Alerts

**Motion Translation**:
- Pilot twitches finger → Thread transmits micro-current → Casket limb moves
- It's not 1:1 (finger doesn't "mime" the movement)
- More like playing an instrument—subtle finger movements create large-scale actions
- **Learning Curve**: Months to walk properly, years to master combat

---

## The Piloting Experience

### Sensory Feedback

**What the Pilot Feels**:
- **Touch**: Every impact to the Casket reverberates through the threads back to fingertips (painful)
- **Vision**: Neural optical link—pilot "sees" through Casket's visual sensors (not through eyes—eyes are closed in the fluid)
- **Sound**: Direct audio feed into ear canals (muffled by fluid, but clear)
- **Proprioception**: Pilot feels the Casket's limbs as extensions of their body (phantom limb sensation)
- **Pain**: Damage to Casket translates to nerve pain in corresponding fingers

**What the Pilot Does NOT Feel**:
- Their own body (limbs go numb after 10 minutes in fluid)
- Temperature (outside the capsule)
- Fatigue (until they disconnect—then it hits all at once)

### The Disconnect Horror

**Physical Symptoms After Piloting**:
- Fingers cramped into claws (take hours to straighten)
- Nail beds bleeding from thread strain
- Nerve pain shooting up arms
- Temporary paralysis (body forgot it existed)
- Nausea from proprioception mismatch
- Psychological dissociation ("Which body is mine?")

**Long-Term Effects**:
- Permanent finger tremors
- Phantom limb sensation even outside Casket
- Difficulty controlling own body ("too small, too weak")
- Addiction to the power (body dysmorphia—feel wrong outside Casket)
- Neural Thread scarring causes chronic pain

---

## Faction Variations

### Church of Absolution: The Penitent Binding

- Threads are **black** (soaked in sanctified oil)
- Pilot wears a **cilice** (spiked belt) inside capsule for constant pain
- Fluid contains diluted **blessed water** (stings open wounds)
- Binding position is strictly enforced (left over right only)
- Capsule interior carved with scripture
- **Philosophy**: "Suffering purifies. Pain is prayer."

---

### Elven Verdant Covenant: The Root Interface

- Threads are **green-white** (organically grown, not surgically implanted)
- Fluid is **sap-based** (amber, sticky, preservative)
- Capsule interior lined with **living bark**
- Threads connect not just to fingers but also:
  - Temples (for thought-control of nature magic)
  - Spine (for deeper Casket integration)
- Pilot's body is slowly **preserved** by the sap (semi-mummified over decades)
- **Philosophy**: "Become one with the machine. Let it take root."

---

### Dwarven Clans: The Mechanized Sync

- Threads are **reinforced with copper wire** (most durable)
- Fluid is **industrial coolant** (clear, chemical smell)
- Capsule has **diagnostic readouts** visible from inside (pilot sees their own vitals)
- Threads have **redundancy backups** (12 threads instead of 10—spares)
- Capsule can be **ejected** in emergency (escape pod feature)
- **Philosophy**: "Engineering over suffering. Safety over tradition."

---

### The Ossuarium: The Bonecage Communion

- Threads are **necrotic black** (dead tissue, but still conductive)
- Fluid is **embalming solution** (keeps pilot's body from decaying further)
- Pilot may be **partially skeletal** (flesh optional)
- Threads attach to exposed bone directly (no nerve pain—already dead)
- Capsule interior is **cold** (refrigerated)
- **Philosophy**: "Death made efficient. The body is a tool, nothing more."

---

### The Wyrd Conclave: The Dreamwire Trance

- Threads are **iridescent** (shift colors, semi-transparent)
- Fluid is **memory liquid** (contains dissolved psychoactive flowers)
- Pilot is in **dream state** while piloting (not fully conscious)
- Threads connect to:
  - Fingers
  - Eyes (directly into optic nerve)
  - Temples (for telepathic network)
- Casket movements are **fluid and impossible** (physics-defying)
- **Philosophy**: "Reality is negotiable. The body is optional."

---

### Nomad Collective: The Scavenger Rig

- Threads are **mismatched** (salvaged from different sources)
- Fluid is **recycled** (brown, murky, "good enough")
- Capsule is **improvised** (welded from scrap tanks)
- Some pilots have **fewer than 10 threads** (lost to accidents, never replaced)
- Capsule comfort is minimal (no padding, harsh environment)
- **Philosophy**: "It doesn't have to be perfect. Just has to work."

---

### Merchant Guilds: The Premium Interface

- Threads are **gold-plated** (shows wealth, also conducts better)
- Fluid is **synthetic perfection** (clear, oxygenated, nutrient-rich)
- Capsule has **luxury features** (cushioned interior, climate control, entertainment feed)
- Threads have **neural dampeners** (less pain, more comfort)
- Capsule is modular (can be transferred between Caskets easily)
- **Philosophy**: "War is business. Suffering is inefficient."

---

### Blighted Packs: The Mutation Harness

- Threads are **organic** (grown from pilot's own mutated tissue)
- Fluid is **adaptive** (changes composition based on pilot's biology)
- Capsule walls are **flesh-lined** (Casket is partially alive)
- Pilots may have **more than 10 threads** (extra fingers/limbs from mutations)
- Threads can **regenerate** if damaged (painful, takes weeks)
- Capsule and pilot are **semi-fused** (harder to disconnect over time)
- **Philosophy**: "We are already monsters. Why pretend otherwise?"

---

### Chitinous Ascendancy: The Hive Node

- Threads are **chitin-based** (insectoid exoskeleton material)
- Fluid is **pheromone solution** (communication medium for hive mind)
- Capsule connects to **multiple pilots simultaneously** (hive control)
- Individual pilot may share capsule with **drone organisms** (symbiotic relationship)
- Threads extend from fingers AND **antennae** (multiple control vectors)
- Capsule interior has **egg sacs** (reproduction occurs inside)
- **Philosophy**: "Individual suffering is irrelevant. The hive endures."

---

## First Sync: The Bonding Ceremony

### Surgical Procedure

**Duration**: 6-8 hours

**Steps**:
1. **Preparation**: Pilot fasts for 3 days (spiritual cleansing)
2. **Anesthesia**: Local only—pilot must be conscious to guide thread growth
3. **Nail Removal**: Fingernails are surgically lifted (not removed entirely)
4. **Nerve Exposure**: Fingertip flesh is peeled back to expose nerve clusters
5. **Soulstone Application**: Ground Soulstone powder is applied to exposed nerves
6. **Thread Growth**: Over 4-6 hours, threads *grow* from the nerves outward
7. **Anchoring**: Threads are guided through nail beds and anchored to bone
8. **Sealing**: Flesh is sutured closed, nails reattached (threads emerge through nail)

**Pain Level**: Described as "watching your nerves crawl out of your fingers"

**Failure Rate**: 15% (threads reject, pilot dies of necrotic shock)

**Psychological Trauma**: 100% (all pilots experience PTSD from First Sync)

---

### First Immersion

After threads are installed, pilot enters capsule for the first time.

**Hour 1**: Panic (drowning sensation, can't move, threads pulling)
**Hour 2**: Dissociation (body feels distant, alien)
**Hour 3**: Phantom sensations (Casket feels like it's *part* of you)
**Hour 4**: First Movement (Casket takes a step—pilot weeps with relief or terror)

**Bonding Success**: Pilot can walk the Casket without falling
**Bonding Failure**: Pilot goes catatonic, must be disconnected (threads removed surgically, permanent nerve damage)

---

## Combat Implications

### Damage Feedback

When Casket is damaged, pilot feels it:

**Arm Severed**:
- Thumb thread snaps
- Pilot's entire hand goes numb
- Phantom pain radiates up arm
- Pilot may scream inside capsule

**Leg Destroyed**:
- Ring or middle finger thread breaks
- Pilot loses balance
- Casket falls (pilot feels the impact through remaining threads)

**Head Struck**:
- Index finger overloads
- Pilot experiences sensory whiteout (temporary blindness/deafness)
- Concussive force feels like brain is being squeezed

**Chassis Breach**:
- If enemy weapon pierces close to capsule:
- Neural Fluid leaks out (pilot begins to suffocate)
- Threads short-circuit (all fingers experience electrical burns)
- Pilot has 30 seconds to disconnect or drown

---

### Death Inside the Capsule

**If Pilot Dies While Connected**:
- Threads remain active for 10-15 minutes (muscle spasms)
- Casket continues moving erratically (puppet with dead puppeteer)
- Eventually collapses when threads fully discharge
- Body is retrieved mummified (fluid preserves it)

**If Casket Is Destroyed**:
- Capsule is usually the last thing to fail (most armored section)
- Pilot may survive inside a dead Casket (trapped, immobile)
- Rescue time limit: 6 hours before oxygen runs out
- Some pilots are never recovered (sealed in their tombs forever)

---

## Psychological Horror

### The Coffin Analogy

Pilots describe the capsule as:
- "A womb made of iron"
- "A grave I climb into willingly"
- "The only place I feel powerful and utterly helpless"

### Body Dysmorphia

Long-term pilots experience:
- **"Casket is my real body"** (their human body feels wrong)
- **"Too small"** (outside Casket, they feel fragile)
- **"Not enough limbs"** (miss the weapon arms)
- **"Blind"** (human eyes feel limited compared to Casket sensors)

### Addiction

Pilots become addicted to:
- **Power**: 12 tons of armored strength vs weak human body
- **Numbness**: Inside capsule, physical body goes numb (escapism)
- **Purpose**: Outside Casket, they're just broken people. Inside, they're warriors.

**Withdrawal symptoms when disconnected too long**:
- Tremors
- Anxiety
- Phantom thread pulling sensations
- Compulsive finger movements
- Hallucinations of Casket presence

---

## Maintenance & Care

### Thread Maintenance

**Daily** (after each deployment):
- Soak fingers in **Soulstone water** (prevents necrosis)
- Apply **nerve salve** to nail beds
- Gentle stretching exercises (prevent thread calcification)

**Weekly**:
- Thread "tuning" (technician adjusts thread tension)
- Infection check (threads can grow bacteria)
- Neural response test (measure signal degradation)

**Monthly**:
- Full thread replacement (old threads cut and regrown)
- Capsule fluid change (old fluid becomes contaminated)
- Psychological evaluation (check for dissociation disorders)

### Capsule Hygiene

- Fluid must be **filtered** after each use (pilot's sweat/blood/tears contaminate it)
- Interior must be **scrubbed** (biofilm builds up)
- Rebreather mask must be **sterilized** (infection risk)

**Neglect consequences**:
- Fluid infection → sepsis
- Thread fouling → loss of motor control
- Psychological breakdown → pilot becomes catatonic

## Why This System Exists

### In-Universe Explanation

**The Remnants are dead. Dead things don't have working nerves.**

Early Casket pilots tried traditional cockpits—sitting, standing, using levers and pedals. It didn't work. Remnant bodies are slow, clumsy, barely functional. They needed a way to bypass their degraded nervous systems entirely.

**The Neural Thread solution**:
- Threads connect *directly* to consciousness (via Soulstone-infused nerve tissue)
- Pilot's intent travels through threads without needing functional muscles
- Casket becomes extension of will, not body

**Side effect**: The system is horrifying, painful, and psychologically damaging. But it works. And in a world where survival is everything, "it works" is enough.

---

### Out-of-Universe (Design Intent)

This system reinforces Penance's themes:

1. **Death as Prison**: Pilots are literally entombed every time they fight
2. **Body Horror**: The threads, the binding, the fluid—all deeply unsettling
3. **Sacrifice**: Piloting isn't empowering, it's *suffering*
4. **No Heroes**: This system strips away any "cool mech pilot" fantasy
5. **Desperation**: No one would choose this unless they had no other option

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Pilot Injury System

When Casket takes damage, roll on **Thread Damage Table**:

| Roll | Result | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Thread Snap (Thumb) | Lose primary weapon arm |
| 2 | Thread Snap (Index) | Lose head rotation/sensors |
| 3 | Thread Fray (Middle) | Movement reduced by half |
| 4 | Thread Overload (Ring) | Take 1d6 damage to pilot HP |
| 5 | Fluid Leak | Pilot begins suffocating (3 rounds to disconnect) |
| 6 | Capsule Breach | Exposed to outside environment (Taint risk) |

### Disconnection Checks

After battle, pilot must make **Disconnection Check** (CON save):
- **Success**: Exit capsule normally (suffer standard post-pilot effects)
- **Failure**: Threads tangled—takes 1d10 minutes to extract (risk of thread damage)
- **Critical Failure**: Threads fused—must be surgically removed (permanent -1 to Dexterity)

### Addiction Mechanic

Each time pilot disconnects, mark **Capsule Addiction**.
- At 5 marks: Disadvantage on all actions outside Casket
- At 10 marks: Pilot refuses to leave Casket voluntarily
- At 15 marks: Pilot *cannot* disconnect (threads have fused with capsule interior)

## Lore Hooks

### The First Pilot

> "We don't know who invented the Control Capsule. The first documented Casket—Marissa's walking corpse-machine—had one. She was dead when she built it. How did she know to bind her arms? To pierce her fingers? To float in the fluid?"
>
> "Some say the knowledge came from the Resonance Engine itself. A gift. Or a curse."

### The Capsule Refusal

> "Some Remnants refuse the threads. They try to pilot Caskets the old way—levers, pedals, manual controls. It's possible, technically."
>
> "They're slower. Clumsier. They lose every fight against thread-pilots."
>
> "But they get to keep their hands."

### The Eternal Pilot

> "There's a Church legend about a Penitent who never disconnected. Been in the capsule for 60 years. Body's dissolved into the fluid. Just threads and bones left."
>
> "The Casket still walks. Still fights."
>
> "They say if you cut open the capsule, you'll find no pilot at all. Just threads, floating in empty fluid, still pulling at the puppet."
