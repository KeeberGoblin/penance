## Image Generator Tips

**For Midjourney**: Use `--ar 16:9` for header images, `--ar 1:1` for faction emblems
**For DALL-E 3**: Emphasize "illuminated manuscript" and "aged parchment" heavily
**For Stable Diffusion**: Use models trained on fantasy art (e.g., Dreamshaper, Deliberate)

**Negative Prompts** (what to avoid):
```
modern technology, bright colors, clean surfaces, pristine condition, futuristic sci-fi, anime style, cartoonish, low detail, digital UI elements, contemporary clothing
```
