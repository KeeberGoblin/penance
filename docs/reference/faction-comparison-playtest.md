## FACTION BREAKDOWN

### Church of Absolution

**Core Identity**: "Pain is power. Sacrifice grants strength."

**Playstyle**:
- Self-harm cards (Blood Offering: discard 2 cards for +3 damage)
- Ally protection (Martyrdom Protocol: redirect damage to self)
- Burst damage combos
- Scales with allied deaths (Righteous Fury: +1 damage per kill)

**Deck Size Range**: 26-48 cards
**SP Maximum**: 3-6 depending on Casket

**Strengths**:
- Highest burst damage
- Strong ally support
- Flexible builds (melee DPS, ranged support, tank)

**Weaknesses**:
- Self-destructive (kills self if reckless)
- Heat management issues
- Weak when isolated

**Best Against**: Dwarves (burst bypasses armor), Ossuarium (kills before salvage value)
**Weak Against**: Elves (mobility avoids burst), fast aggro

**Playtest Focus**: Test if self-harm risk/reward is balanced, verify Martyrdom Protocol doesn't break multiplayer

---

### Dwarven Forge-Guilds

**Core Identity**: "Steel bends. It does not break."

**Playstyle**:
- Stack Rune Counters (reduce damage by 1 per counter, max 3)
- All attacks Armor-Piercing (ignore Defense buffs)
- Heat-to-damage conversion (Forge Fury)
- Component protection (Unbreakable)
- Stone Endurance (32 HP instead of 30)

**Deck Size Range**: 30-50 cards (32-52 with Stone Endurance)
**SP Maximum**: 3-5 depending on Casket

**Strengths**:
- Highest survivability (32 HP + damage reduction)
- Armor-piercing shuts down defensive opponents
- Consistent damage

**Weaknesses**:
- Low mobility (slow Heavy Caskets)
- High Heat generation
- SP-starved (3-4 SP per turn on Heavy/Fortress)

**Best Against**: Church (armor-piercing ignores buffs), defensive opponents
**Weak Against**: Elves (kited easily), ranged bombardment

**Playtest Focus**: Test if 32 HP is too tanky, verify armor-piercing isn't oppressive

---

### The Ossuarium

**Core Identity**: "Death is merely salvage. Corruption is the cost."

**Playstyle**:
- Soul Shard Salvage (gain 3 Shards per kill, spend for emergency repairs)
- Brutal Taint corruption (permanent penalties from using necro-tech)
- Scavenge Protocol (Salvage Protocol: 3 Shards → 3 cards, +2 Taint)
- Resurrection via Phylactery (auto-revive once per mission at cost of Soul Shards)
- Minion summoning (Raise Dead: summon Thralls)
- Decay cards instead of Damage cards on reshuffle

**Deck Size Range**: 26-48 cards
**SP Maximum**: 3-6 depending on Casket

**Strengths**:
- Resource generation from kills (Soul Shards)
- Emergency repairs mid-combat
- Multiple resurrections
- Grinds opponents through attrition

**Weaknesses**:
- Taint penalties cripple at high corruption (9-10 Taint: -4 damage, +1 SP costs)
- Requires kills to generate Shards
- Weak to burst damage (killed before salvage value)
- Corruption is permanent (never decays)

**Best Against**: Dwarves (grind through armor), Elves (Thralls block mobility)
**Weak Against**: Church (burst kills before salvage), control/stuns, denial strategies

**Playtest Focus**: Test if Soul Shard economy is balanced, verify Taint penalties create meaningful risk/reward, check if salvage rate is oppressive

---

### Elven Verdant Covenant

**Core Identity**: "We are the pruning blade."

**Playstyle**:
- Bleed damage-over-time (stacks infinitely, triggers at enemy turn start)
- High mobility (Leaf Dance, Shadow Step)
- Surgical strikes (Pruning Cut: component targeting)
- Passive regeneration (Photosynthesis + Verdant Regeneration + Living Seal = 3 cards/round)
- Area control (Root Bind, Vine Walls, Seed Pods)

**Deck Size Range**: 26-48 cards
**SP Maximum**: 3-6 depending on Casket

**Strengths**:
- Best damage-over-time
- Highest mobility
- Best passive regeneration

**Weaknesses**:
- Lower burst damage
- Fragile (light armor)
- Requires setup time

**Best Against**: Church (mobility avoids burst), Dwarves (Bleed bypasses armor)
**Weak Against**: Ossuarium (salvage sustain counters slow damage), fast aggro

**Playtest Focus**: Test if Bleed stacking is balanced, verify mobility isn't too strong

## BALANCE CONCERNS TO MONITOR

### Church

- Does Martyrdom Protocol break multiplayer? (Redirect all damage)
- Is Righteous Fury scaling too strong? (+1 damage per kill, permanent)

### Dwarves
- Is 32 HP (Stone Endurance) too tanky?
- Is armor-piercing oppressive? (Ignores all Defense)
- Are Heavy Caskets too slow? (4 SP = only 2 attacks per turn)

### Ossuarium
- Is Soul Shard economy balanced? (3 Shards per kill, 2-5 Shards for repairs)
- Are Taint penalties harsh enough? (9-10 Taint: -4 damage, +1 SP costs)
- Is Salvage Protocol oppressive? (3 Shards → 3 cards mid-combat)
- Are Thralls balanced? (1 HP, 2 damage, free meatshields)

### Elves
- Does Bleed stack too high? (Infinite stacking = 10+ damage per turn late-game)
- Is mobility too strong? (Leaf Dance + Shadow Step = 6 hex movement + attack)
- Is passive regeneration too strong? (3 cards per round passive)
