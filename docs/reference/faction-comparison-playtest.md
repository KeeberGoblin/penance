## FACTION BREAKDOWN

### Church of Absolution

**Core Identity**: "Pain is power. Sacrifice grants strength."

**Playstyle**:
- Self-harm cards (Blood Offering: discard 2 cards for +3 damage)
- Ally protection (Martyrdom Protocol: redirect damage to self)
- Burst damage combos
- Scales with allied deaths (Righteous Fury: +1 damage per kill)

**Deck Size Range**: 26-48 cards
**SP Maximum**: 3-6 depending on Casket

**Strengths**:
- Highest burst damage
- Strong ally support
- Flexible builds (melee DPS, ranged support, tank)

**Weaknesses**:
- Self-destructive (kills self if reckless)
- Heat management issues
- Weak when isolated

**Best Against**: Dwarves (burst bypasses armor), Ossuarium (kills before lifesteal activates)
**Weak Against**: Elves (mobility avoids burst), fast aggro

**Playtest Focus**: Test if self-harm risk/reward is balanced, verify Martyrdom Protocol doesn't break multiplayer

---

### Dwarven Forge-Guilds

**Core Identity**: "Steel bends. It does not break."

**Playstyle**:
- Stack Rune Counters (reduce damage by 1 per counter, max 3)
- All attacks Armor-Piercing (ignore Defense buffs)

**SP Maximum**: 3-5 depending on Casket

**Strengths**:
- Highest survivability (32 HP + damage reduction)
- Armor-piercing shuts down defensive opponents
- Consistent damage

**Weaknesses**:

**Playtest Focus**: Test if 32 HP is too tanky, verify armor-piercing isn't oppressive

---

### The Ossuarium

**Core Identity**: "Death is merely a change in employment."

**Playstyle**:
- Lifesteal attacks (Soul Harvest: 4 damage, recover 4 cards)
- Corpse exploitation (Corpse Fuel: recover 5 cards per kill)

**Strengths**:
- Best damage-over-time

## BALANCE CONCERNS TO MONITOR

### Church

- Is Righteous Fury scaling too strong? (+1 damage per kill, permanent)

### Dwarves

- Is armor-piercing oppressive? (Ignores all Defense)
- Are Heavy Caskets too slow? (4 SP = only 2 attacks per turn)

### Ossuarium
- Is triple resurrection too strong? (Phylactery + Undying Resilience + Relic = 3 lives)
- Does lifesteal sustain too well? (Soul Harvest: 4 damage = 4 cards)
- Are Thralls balanced? (1 HP, 2 damage, free meatshields)

### Elves
- Does Bleed stack too high? (Infinite stacking = 10+ damage per turn late-game)
- Is mobility too strong? (Leaf Dance + Shadow Step = 6 hex movement + attack)
- Is passive regeneration too strong? (3 cards per round passive)
