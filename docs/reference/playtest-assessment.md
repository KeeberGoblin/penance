## What We Have: The Strong Foundation

### 1. World-Building & Lore ✅ EXCELLENT
**Status**: **95% Complete**

**Strengths**:
- 437-year extended timeline (feels epic, justifies technology development)
- 9 unique factions with distinct cultures and beliefs
- Puppeteer capsule system (deeply unsettling body horror)
- Leg-skimming sacrifice system (meaningful permanent choices)
- Extensive Chronicle entries, iconic NPCs, faction relationships
- Theslar Engine doomsday clock mechanic

**Minor Gaps**:
- Campaign mission structure (linear vs branching? No map yet)
- Specific story beats per mission (events exist, but not tied to progression)

**Playtest Impact**: **Low** (can playtest Arena mode without campaign story)

**Recommendation**: Leave for post-playtest. World-building is excellent and won't block testing.

---

### 2. Asymmetric Faction Design ✅ EXCELLENT
**Status**: **4 Playable Factions Complete (v2.0 System)**

**Complete Factions**:
- **Church of Absolution**: Self-harm for burst damage (Blood Offering, infinite scaling)
  - [Full Deck](../factions/church/deck-equipment-system.md)
- **Dwarven Forge-Guilds**: Fortress tank (Rune Counters, armor-piercing)
  - [Full Deck](../factions/dwarves/deck-equipment-system.md)
- **The Ossuarium**: Lifesteal vampire (Soul Harvest, Decay cards, resurrections)
  - [Full Deck](../factions/ossuarium/deck-equipment-system.md)
- **Elven Verdant Covenant**: Hit-and-run assassin (Bleed stacking, mobility)
  - [Full Deck](../factions/elves/deck-equipment-system.md)

**Design-Only Factions** (mechanics designed, not yet playable):
- The Wyrd Conclave: Teleportation/reality-bending
- Nomadic Scrap-Takers: Salvage mid-battle
- Merchant Guilds: Economic warfare
- Blighted Packs: Mutation weaponization
- Chitinous Horde: Hive mind tactics

**Playtest Impact**: **High** (this IS the game's identity)

**Recommendation**: This is your strongest asset. Make sure playtest showcases this.

---

### 3. Equipment System v2.0 ✅ EXCELLENT
**Status**: **100% Complete**

**Strengths**:
- Modular equipment system (60+ items)
- Variable deck sizes (26-50 cards depending on equipment)
- Equipment categories:
  - Weapons (15+): Dagger, Longsword, Greatsword, Warhammer, Spear, etc.
  - Shields/Offhand (6+): Buckler, Kite Shield, Tower Shield, Repair Kit
  - Plating (4+): Ablative, Spike, Reinforced, Stealth
  - Sigils (12+): Repair, Heat Sink, Targeting, faction-exclusive
- Crafting & salvage economy (KDM-style)
- Smelting system (2 cards = 1 scrap)
- Deck construction rules fully documented
- [Complete Equipment Pool](equipment-pool-complete.md)

**Playtest Impact**: **Core feature** (enables deck customization and replayability)

---

### 4. Campaign & Progression ✅ GOOD
**Status**: **85% Complete**

**Strengths**:
- Settlement mechanics (14 buildings, resource economy)
- Pilot scars (80+ entries, Kingdom Death-style permanent traits)
- Loot tables (4 rarity tiers, specialized tables)
- Faction relationships (7-tier scale, player influence)
- Theslar Engine instability track (doomsday clock)
- Leg-skimming progression (sacrifice for power)
- Pilot care system (morale, accessibility, downtime)

**Gaps**:
- Campaign map/mission structure (how do missions unlock?)
- XP/leveling rules (do pilots gain XP? Or just scars?)
- Mission rewards table (beyond "100 Credits for primary objective")

**Playtest Impact**: **Low** (Arena mode doesn't need campaign)

**Recommendation**: Test Arena combat first, then add campaign layer.

---

### 5. Visual Identity & Art Direction ✅ EXCELLENT
**Status**: **90% Complete**

**Strengths**:
- Baroque-romanticist-brutalist fusion defined
- Comprehensive AI art prompts (36 Caskets + capsule cutaways)
- Clear visual references (Caravaggio lighting, Goya horror, Soviet monuments)
- Faction aesthetic distinctions clear

**Gaps**:
- No actual art generated yet (just prompts)
- No player mat layouts
- No card templates designed

**Playtest Impact**: **Low** (can playtest with placeholder art)

**Recommendation**: Generate 5-10 AI art samples to show visual identity, but not critical for playtest.

---

## What Was Needed: Previously Critical Gaps (NOW COMPLETE)

### 1. Combat Resolution System ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: **100% Complete** (fully documented with flowcharts)

**What Exists**:
- Cards have attack values (e.g., "Deal 6 damage")
- Facing matters (rear attacks are better)
- Defense stat mentioned (shields add +2 Defense)
- Component targeting exists (aim for arms, legs, head)

**What's Missing**:
- **Attack resolution flowchart** (step-by-step: declare → hit roll → damage → component damage)
- **Hit roll system** (automatic hits? Dice-based? Which attacks auto-hit?)
- **Defense mechanics** (is Defense a target number? Damage reduction? Evasion?)
- **Armor system** (separate from Defense? Ablative? How does it work?)
- **Damage application** (discard cards? Mark damage tokens? HP pool?)
- **Critical hit rules** (rear attacks mentioned, but no crit system defined)
- **Minimum damage rule** (can attacks deal 0 damage after Defense reduction?)

**Playtest Impact**: **BLOCKING** (cannot resolve a single attack)

**Recommended Solution**:

```markdown
## Combat Resolution (Detailed)

### Step 1: DECLARE ATTACK
- Attacker chooses target in range and line of sight
- Plays attack card from hand, spends SP cost
- Declares which component to target (if applicable)
- Checks facing (Front/Side/Rear)

### Step 2: DEFENDER RESPONSE
- Defender may play reactive defense card (Unyielding Bulwark, etc.)
  - Reactive cards have Initiative [—] and cost 0 SP
  - Can only play 1 reactive card per attack
- Apply Defense modifiers from facing:
  - Front: Full Defense
  - Side: -1 Defense
  - Rear: -2 Defense (minimum 0)

### Step 3: HIT ROLL (if applicable)
- **Melee attacks**: Auto-hit (adjacent, hard to miss)
- **Ranged attacks**: Roll 1d6
  - 4+ = Hit
  - +1 if target in Close range (2-3 hexes)
  - -1 if target has cover
  - -1 if target in Long range (4+ hexes)
- **Magic/Tech attacks**: Auto-hit (unless card specifies otherwise)

### Step 4: CALCULATE DAMAGE
- Start with card's base damage
- Add/subtract modifiers:
  - Rear attack: +2 damage
  - Side attack: +1 damage
  - Buffs/debuffs from other cards
- Subtract defender's Defense
- **Minimum 1 damage** (attacks always deal at least 1 if they hit)

### Step 5: APPLY DAMAGE
- Defender **discards cards equal to damage** from top of deck
- If component was targeted, mark that component
  - 3+ damage to same component = Component Disabled
  - Disabled components lose function (weapon drops, movement halved, etc.)
- If deck runs out, defender is **defeated** (unconscious, not dead)

### Step 6: DRAW PHASE
- Attacker draws 1 card (if hand < 6)
- Play continues
```

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours to write, test, iterate

---

### 2. Turn Structure ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: **100% Complete** (SP-based 4-phase system documented)

**The Problem**:
Current docs describe TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS:

**System A: Card-Based Turns** (from card-anatomy.md)
- "Each player secretly chooses 1 card"
- "Reveal simultaneously, resolve by initiative"
- "Repeat until round ends"
- GKR-style simultaneous play

**System B: SP-Based Turns** (implied by SP system)
- Scout has 5 SP, cards cost 1-3 SP
- Implies playing MULTIPLE cards per turn
- Deck-builder-style spend-your-pool

**These are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAMES.**

**Playtest Impact**: **BLOCKING** (cannot play a single turn)

**Recommended Solution**: **Choose System B (SP-Based)**

```markdown
## Turn Structure

### Initiative Phase
- All players roll 1d6
- Highest roll acts first (ties re-roll)
- Play proceeds clockwise after first player

### Player Turn
1. **Refresh** (only if this is your first turn of the round)
   - Restore SP to maximum (5 for Scout, 4 for Support, etc.)
   - Check Heat level (if in Danger Zone, roll Strain)

2. **Action Phase** (spend SP to play cards)
   - Play cards from hand until you:
     - Run out of SP, OR
     - Choose to pass, OR
     - Hand is empty
   - Each card costs SP (listed on card)
   - Free actions (0 SP) can be mixed in
   - Movement costs 1 SP per hex

3. **Draw Phase**
   - Draw cards until hand = 6 (or max hand size)
   - If deck runs out, shuffle discard into new deck
   - **Add 1 Damage card to deck** when reshuffling (Kingdom Death-style degradation)

4. **End Turn**
   - Announce "Done"
   - Next player begins their turn

### Reactive Cards
- Can be played during OPPONENT'S turn
- Must have Initiative [—] keyword
- Usually cost 0 SP
- Interrupt opponent's action (e.g., defend against attack)

### End of Round
- Round ends when all players have passed
- Remove temporary effects
- Check Heat (anyone in Danger Zone rolls Strain)
- Begin new round (Initiative Phase)
```

**Time Estimate**: 1 hour to write

---

### 3. Deck Construction Rules ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: **100% Complete** (v2.0 equipment system fully documented)

**What Exists**:
- Universal Core: 10 mandatory cards (everyone has)
- Equipment cards: 4-6 per weapon, 3-4 per shield
- Faction tactics: 5 available, choose 3
- Total deck size: ~23-30 cards

**What's Missing**:
- **Exact deck size per Casket type** (Scout: 20? 25? Player choice?)
- **Card copy limits** (can I have 3 copies of "Faithful Thrust"?)
- **Equipment limits** (can I equip 2 longswords? One in each hand?)
- **Faction tactic selection rules** (choose 3 before battle, or build into deck permanently?)
- **Starting hand size** (stated as 6, but needs confirmation)
- **Mulligan rules** (can I redraw starting hand?)

**Playtest Impact**: **BLOCKING** (cannot build a legal deck)

**Recommended Solution**:

```markdown
## Deck Construction Rules

### Universal Rules (All Caskets)
- **Starting Hand**: 6 cards
- **Mulligan**: Once per game, before first turn, may shuffle hand into deck and draw 6 new cards
- **Card Copy Limit**: Maximum 2 copies of any single card in deck
- **Deck Size**: Varies by Casket type (see below)

### Deck Composition

**1. Universal Core** (10 cards, mandatory):

- Brace for Impact (Defense)
- Overextend (Movement + Risk)
- Survey the Field (Utility)
- Breathe the Core (Heat Management)
- Rally Cry (Support)
- Sensor Sweep (Reconnaissance)
- Emergency Vent (Heat Management)
- Feint (Combat)
- Retreat (Movement)

**2. Equipment Cards** (varies by loadout):
- Right Arm Weapon: Adds 4-6 cards (depends on weapon)
- Left Arm Weapon/Shield: Adds 3-4 cards
- Relic Slot (if available): Adds 3-4 cards

**3. Faction Tactics** (choose 3 from 5 available):
- Before each battle, choose 3 faction-specific tactic cards
- These 3 cards are shuffled into your deck
- Cannot change mid-mission

### Example Deck (Church Confessor)
- **Casket**: Confessor (Light)
- **Right Arm**: Faithkeeper Longsword (adds 4 cards)
- **Left Arm**: Buckler Shield (adds 3 cards)
- **Relic**: Repair Kit (adds 3 cards)
- **Faction Tactics** (choose 3 from 5):
  - Blood Offering
  - Righteous Fury
  - Martyrdom Protocol

**Total Deck**: 10 (Universal) + 4 (Longsword) + 3 (Buckler) + 3 (Repair Kit) + 3 (Tactics) = **23 cards**

### Casket Type Deck Sizes

| Casket Type | Base Deck | Equipment Slots | Final Deck Size |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Light (Confessor) | 10 Universal | Right Arm + Left Arm + 1 Relic | 20-26 cards |
| Medium (Martyr) | 10 Universal | Right Arm + Left Arm + 1 Relic | 23-28 cards |
| Heavy (Crusader) | 10 Universal | Right Arm + Left Arm + 2 Relics | 26-34 cards |
| Assault (Cathedral) | 10 Universal | 2 × Right Arm + Shield + 2 Relics | 30-40 cards |
```

**Time Estimate**: 2 hours to write + create examples for all 9 factions

---

### 4. Range & Line of Sight ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: **100% Complete** (hex-based with diagrams)

**What Exists**:
- Range bands mentioned (Close: 2-3 hexes, Long: 4+ hexes)
- Facing matters (front/side/rear)
- Cover mentioned (provides bonuses)

**What's Missing**:
- **Hex counting diagram** (visual showing range 1, 2, 3 from center hex)
- **Line of sight rules** (what blocks LOS? Terrain? Other Caskets?)
- **Cover mechanics** (+1 Defense? -1 to hit? Blocks LOS entirely?)
- **Firing arcs** (can you shoot in any direction? Only front-facing?)
- **Elevation rules** (shooting up/down hills?)

**Playtest Impact**: **HIGH** (every ranged attack needs this)

**Recommended Solution**:

Create 1-page diagram showing:
1. Hex range counting (1-6 hexes from center)
2. LOS blocking (terrain examples: walls block, forests provide cover)
3. Firing arcs (6 hex facings, front 3 hexes = firing arc)
4. Cover rules (+1 Defense if target partially obscured)

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours (includes creating visual diagrams)

---
