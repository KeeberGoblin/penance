## Usage Guidelines

### Placeholder Image Locations
These images are designed for use as:
1. **Faction selection screens** (interactive website/app)
2. **Rulebook chapter headers** (print/PDF)
3. **Marketing materials** (social media, posters)
4. **Card backs** (faction-specific deck identification)
5. **Scenario setup illustrations** (showing faction aesthetics)

### File Naming Convention
```
penance-manuscript-[faction]-[size].png

Examples:
penance-manuscript-church-2400x3200.png
penance-manuscript-dwarves-1200x1600.png
penance-manuscript-ossuarium-thumbnail.png
penance-manuscript-elves-print-quality.png
```

### Generation Tips for AI Image Tools

**Best Practices**:
1. Generate at highest resolution possible (2400x3200px minimum)
2. Use "medieval illuminated manuscript" + "15th century" as primary style keywords
3. Reference specific artists: "in the style of Limbourg Brothers" or "Book of Kells"
4. Emphasize "aged parchment texture" and "hand-drawn ink linework"
5. Request "flat perspective" and "hierarchical scale" for authentic manuscript style
6. Add "no modern elements" or "historically accurate medieval art" to avoid anachronisms

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Modern perspective (3D vanishing point perspective)
- Photo-realistic rendering (should look hand-drawn)
- Digital gradients (use cross-hatching for shading instead)
- Neon colors (medieval pigments were muted except gold leaf)
- Clean/pristine pages (should look aged with 500 years of wear)

---

## Alternative Faction Variations

### If generating multiple variations per faction:

**Church of Absolution**:
- Variant A: Focus on martyrdom (stigmata, bleeding wounds, crown of thorns)
- Variant B: Focus on divine judgment (sword raised, angelic imagery)
- Variant C: Focus on confession (kneeling pose, broken chains)

**Dwarven Forge-Guilds**:
- Variant A: Focus on defense (tower shield forward, fortress stance)
- Variant B: Focus on craftsmanship (hammer on anvil, rune-etching)
- Variant C: Focus on endurance (layered armor, mountain backdrop)

**The Ossuarium**:
- Variant A: Focus on resurrection (emerging from grave, soil falling)
- Variant B: Focus on soul harvest (scythe reaping, spirits visible)
- Variant C: Focus on decay (crumbling architecture, entropy)

**Elven Verdant Covenant**:
- Variant A: Focus on hunt (arrow drawn, prey in sights)
- Variant B: Focus on nature (blooming flowers, regeneration)
- Variant C: Focus on bleed (thorny attacks, blood drops)

---
