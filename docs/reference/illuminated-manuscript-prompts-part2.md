# Illuminated Manuscript Image Prompts - Part 2
## Penance: Absolution Through Steel

**Purpose**: Medieval manuscript-style placeholder images for Crucible Packs and The Exchange
**Style Reference**: 15th century Gothic illuminated manuscripts + Leonardo da Vinci technical drawings
**Technology Level**: 1800s Victorian industrial era aesthetics (despite 437 years post-apocalypse)
**Date Created**: October 16, 2025

## Important: Technology Level Context

**World Setting**: Although 437 years have passed since the Sundering (Year 0), technological development regressed and stagnated. The world's current technology level is approximately **1800s Victorian era**—steam power, early industrial machinery, mechanical engineering, but NO modern electronics, computers, or advanced materials.

**Visual Implications**:
- Caskets use **steam engines, hydraulic pistons, coal furnaces** (not fusion reactors)
- **Riveted iron plates, brass fittings, copper wiring** (not carbon fiber or alloys)
- **Mechanical gauges, pressure valves, gear systems** (not digital displays)
- **Gas lamps, lanterns, firelight** for illumination (not LED or neon)
- **Aesthetic**: Victorian Gothic meets medieval fantasy

---

## Universal Elements (Apply to Both Factions)

### Core Aesthetic
- Hand-drawn ink linework with gold leaf accents
- Illuminated manuscript border with intricate knotwork
- Aged parchment texture with water stains and worn edges
- Flat perspective with hierarchical scale (larger = more important)
- Latin-style script banners
- Marginalia showing dice symbols, hex grids, equipment cards
- Decorative initials with grotesque figures
- **Victorian industrial elements**: gears, pistons, steam vents, brass mechanisms

### Technical Details
- Hexagonal flagstone ground pattern (subtle hex grid)
- Visible Soulstone (glowing crystal) embedded in Casket chest
- Transparent cockpit capsule showing pilot connected by golden neural threads
- Cross-hatched shading for depth
- Memento mori themes (skulls, bones, death imagery)
- **1800s technology**: riveted plates, exposed machinery, steam exhaust, coal smoke

### Color Palette Guidelines
- Black ink (primary linework)
- Gold leaf accents (highlights, borders, sacred elements)
- Faction-specific accent color
- Muted earth tones (browns, grays)
- Aged parchment background (cream, beige with stains)

  maintenance unlike weathered war Caskets)
- No battle damage—every surface professionally maintained (hired maintenance crews)

  aesthetics, brass gears)

PILOT:
- Wealthy merchant's corpse in IMMACULATE tailored suit (flesh intact, well-preserved
  by wealth)
- Pale aristocratic face (died old and rich, never saw combat personally)
- Thin wireframe spectacles still on skull (reading glasses, intellectual vanity)

- Massive iron vault door open in background (treasury visible inside, stacks of
  Soulstone currency)
- Mahogany counting desks with brass scales and ledgers

## Comparison: Crucible vs Exchange Aesthetics

### Crucible Packs Philosophy
- **Honor through trial**: Volcanic aesthetics, primal strength, ancestral traditions
- **Rough and weathered**: Battle-scarred armor, ash-covered, forge-hammered imperfection
- **Natural elemental power**: Lava, fire, volcanic rock (nature's forge)
- **Tribal warrior culture**: War masks, clan symbols, ritual scars
- **1800s industrial as necessity**: Coal furnaces, steam vents (functional, not decorative)

### The Exchange Philosophy
- **Wealth as power**: Pristine armor, gold trim, professional maintenance
- **Cold corporate efficiency**: Immaculate condition, no emotional damage, hired labor
- **Economic control**: Ledgers, contracts, precision calculation
- **Aristocratic culture**: Tailored suits, formal attire, intellectual vanity
- **1800s industrial as status**: Swiss precision mechanics, expensive craftsmanship
  (wealth display)

### File Naming Convention

Examples:
penance-manuscript-crucible-2400x3200.png
penance-manuscript-exchange-1200x1600.png
penance-manuscript-crucible-thumbnail.png

```

### Generation Tips for AI Image Tools

**Best Practices**:
1. Generate at highest resolution possible (2400x3200px minimum)
2. Use "medieval illuminated manuscript" + "15th century" as primary style keywords
3. **Add "Victorian industrial aesthetics" + "1800s steam technology"** for period accuracy
4. Reference specific artists: "in the style of Limbourg Brothers" or "Book of Kells"
5. Emphasize "aged parchment texture" and "hand-drawn ink linework"
6. Request "flat perspective" and "hierarchical scale" for authentic manuscript style
7. Add "riveted iron plates" + "brass fittings" + "steam vents" for 1800s tech level
8. **Explicitly state "1800s technology level, NOT futuristic sci-fi"** to avoid modern aesthetics

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Modern perspective (3D vanishing point perspective)
- Photo-realistic rendering (should look hand-drawn)
- Digital gradients (use cross-hatching for shading instead)
- Neon colors (medieval pigments were muted except gold leaf)
- Clean/pristine pages (should look aged with 500 years of wear)
- **Futuristic technology** (NO holographic displays, energy weapons, or sleek sci-fi)
- **Modern materials** (NO carbon fiber, plastics, or advanced alloys—use iron, brass,
  copper only)

- **Texture Overlay**: Consider adding linen or canvas texture in post-processing

### For Digital/Web Use
- **Screen Resolution**: 72-150 DPI (web-optimized)
- **Color Mode**: RGB
