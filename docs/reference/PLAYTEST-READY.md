## QUICK START: FIRST PLAYTEST

### Step 1: Choose Factions (5 minutes)
Each player picks one of the 4 factions:
- **Church** (easiest) - Straightforward aggression
- **Dwarves** (easy) - Forgiving tank
- **Ossuarium** (medium) - Resource management
- **Elves** (hard) - Precise positioning required

**Recommended First Game**: Church vs Dwarves (offense vs defense)

### Step 2: Build Decks (10 minutes)
Each faction deck consists of:
- **10 Universal Core** (everyone has these)
- **6 Faction Core** (faction-specific abilities)
- **Variable Equipment** (choose from equipment pool)
- **2 Tactics** (choose 2 from 5 available)

**Pre-Built Deck Example - Church "Martyr's Fury" (30 cards)**:
- 10 Universal Core
- 6 Church Core (Blood Offering, Divine Judgment, etc.)
- 12 Equipment: Longsword (6) + Buckler (2) + Repair Sigil (2) + Heat Sink (2)
- 2 Tactics: Flagellant's Zeal + Crusader's Vow

**Pre-Built Deck Example - Dwarven "Immovable Wall" (32 cards)**:
- 10 Universal Core
- 6 Dwarven Core (Rune of Protection, Stone Endurance, etc.)
- 14 Equipment: Warhammer (6) + Tower Shield (4) + Reinforced Plating (2) + Repair Sigil (2)
- 2 Tactics: Forge Mastery + Unbreakable Spirit

### Step 3: Gather Materials
- [ ] 2d6 Attack Dice (custom symbols OR standard d6 with conversion chart)
- [ ] 1d6 Defense Die per damage point (custom OR standard)
- [ ] 1d6 Suffering Die (Church-specific, custom OR standard)
- [ ] Tokens for Heat tracking (0-10+)
- [ ] Tokens for SP tracking (3-6 SP per turn)
- [ ] Tokens for Rune Counters (Dwarves only, 0-5+)
- [ ] Tokens for Bleed Counters (Elves only, stacks infinitely)
- [ ] Component Damage markers (Right Arm, Left Arm, Legs, Head, Chassis)
- [ ] Facing indicators (arrow tokens or dice)
- [ ] Paper for tracking HP (cards remaining in deck)

### Step 4: Print Documents
- [ ] Print [Quick Reference Sheet](../rules/quick-reference.md) (2 copies)
- [ ] Print [Proving Grounds Scenario](../scenarios/01-proving-grounds.md) (map section)
- [ ] Print [Dice Reference](../rules/dice-reference.md) (if using standard d6)
- [ ] Print faction deck lists (write card names on index cards OR use card database)

### Step 5: Setup Map
Use **The Proving Grounds** scenario:
- **12×12 hex grid**
- **Terrain**:
  - Forest (8 hexes): Light Cover (+1 Defense)
  - Rubble (8 hexes): Light Cover, difficult terrain (2 SP/hex)
  - Water/Mud (20 hexes): Difficult terrain, remove 1 Heat at turn end
  - Elevation 1 (4 hexes): +1 damage from here, ignore cover
  - Elevation 2 (4 hexes): +2 damage, ignore cover, +1 Range

### Step 6: Deploy
- **Church**: Top-left quadrant (rows 1-3, columns 1-3)
- **Dwarves**: Bottom-right quadrant (rows 10-12, columns 10-12)
- Roll 1d6 for deployment order (higher roll chooses who deploys first)

### Step 7: Play!
Follow the **4-phase turn structure**:

1. **Refresh Phase**:
   - Restore SP to maximum (Light: 6, Medium: 5, Heavy: 4, Fortress: 3)
   - If Heat ≥ 5: Roll Strain check (2d6, 7+ = pass)
   - Clear temporary effects

2. **Action Phase**:
   - Play cards (spend SP)
   - Move (1 SP per hex, 2 SP for difficult terrain)
   - Attack (roll dice, apply damage)
   - Reactive cards (0 SP, interrupt attacker)

3. **Draw Phase**:
   - Draw to hand size 6
   - If deck empty: Reshuffle discard + add 1 Damage card (death spiral)

4. **End Turn Phase**:
   - Remove "until end of turn" effects
   - Check victory conditions

**Victory**: Reduce opponent to 0 HP (deck + discard pile empty)

## EXPECTED GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE

### Turns 1-3: Positioning (15 minutes)
- Both players navigate terrain toward center
- Church moves faster (6 SP, lighter Caskets)
- Dwarves set up defensive buffs (Rune of Protection)
- Minimal damage, mostly setup

### Turns 4-6: First Engagement (10 minutes)
- Church closes to Melee range
- First attacks land (3-6 damage each)
- Heat begins building (especially from heavy attacks)
- First Component Damage tracked

### Turns 7-10: Brutal Exchange (15 minutes)
- Both sides trading heavy blows
- Church using Blood Offering for burst damage (+3 dmg)
- Dwarves stacking Rune Counters (reduce damage by 3)
- First reshuffle likely (add 1 Damage card to deck)
- Heat Strain checks begin (5+ Heat)

### Turns 11-15: Death Spiral (10 minutes)
- Decks contain Damage cards (dead draws, reduce hand size)
- Component destruction occurs (3+ Component Damage = destroyed)
- Players desperate, using ultimate cards
- One side collapses (0 HP)

**Expected Winner**: 50/50 balanced matchup (Church offense vs Dwarven defense)

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

After playing this scenario 2-3 times, players should understand:

1. **SP Economy**: When to spend, when to save, when to enter Danger Zone (+2 SP, risk Strain)
2. **Heat Management**: Risk/reward of high-Heat cards, Strain checks at 5+ Heat
3. **Deck Cycling**: When to reshuffle, when to delay, Damage card accumulation
4. **Component Damage**: Tracking by location, destruction effects (lose entire card type)
5. **Facing Modifiers**: Rear arc +2 damage, side arc +1 damage, shield side +1 Defense
6. **Terrain Usage**: Cover (+1/+2 Defense), elevation (+1/+2 damage), difficult terrain (2 SP/hex)
7. **Reactive Cards**: 0 SP interrupts (Brace, Parry, Unbreakable)
8. **Death Spiral**: How Damage cards cripple deck consistency (25% dead draws after 3 reshuffles)
9. **Dice System**: Attack Dice (to-hit + damage), Defense Dice (block or escalate), modifiers
10. **Faction Mechanics**: Blood Offering vs Rune Counters (asymmetric gameplay)

## NEXT STEPS AFTER PLAYTEST

### Immediate Iteration (Same Session)
1. **Swap Tactics**: Try different Tactic combinations (5 available, choose 2)
2. **Swap Equipment**: Try different weapons/shields (60+ options)
3. **Swap Factions**: Try Ossuarium (lifesteal) or Elves (bleed stacking)
4. **Add Pilot Wounds**: Include Pilot Wound Decks for full brutality (optional)

### Future Playtests (New Sessions)
1. **Scenario #2**: Reliquary Ruins (objective control, different map)
2. **Different Factions**: All 4 factions available (Church, Dwarves, Ossuarium, Elves)
3. **Campaign Mode**: Link scenarios with event tables, loot, settlements
4. **Boss Encounter**: Test HP deck boss system (Sister Vex, Iron Saint)

- [x] Deck-as-HP (discard cards when damaged, variable deck size 26-50)
- [x] Component destruction (KDM-style brutality, permanent consequences)
- [x] Heat/Strain system (risk/reward, 5+ Heat = Danger Zone)
- [x] Facing modifiers (rear arc +2 dmg, shield side +1 Defense)
- [x] Reactive cards (0 SP interrupts)
- [x] Death spiral (Damage cards on reshuffle, inevitable decline)
- [x] Custom dice system (Attack, Defense, Suffering dice with symbols)

### Equipment System v2.0 ✅

- [x] Deck customization (4 slots: Weapon + Shield/Offhand + 1-4 Accessories)

### Faction Asymmetry ✅
- [x] Church: Aggressive self-harm for burst damage (infinite scaling)
- [x] Dwarves: Defensive attrition with armor-piercing (rune stacking)
- [x] Ossuarium: Lifesteal vampire with resurrections (Soul Harvest)
- [x] Elves: Hit-and-run assassin with infinite bleed stacking
- [x] Contrasting playstyles (offense/defense/lifesteal/DoT)
- [x] Unique faction mechanics (Blood Offering / Runes / Soul Harvest / Bleed)

### Playtest Readiness ✅
- [x] Complete rules (no "TBD" sections)
- [x] 4 complete faction decks (variable equipment)
- [x] 2 scenarios with maps (ready to print)
- [x] Example of play (shows how rules work)

## KNOWN ISSUES / FUTURE WORK

### Potential Balance Problems
1. **Infinite Scaling** (Church/Elves) may make games snowball
2. **Component Destruction** may be too punishing (lose entire card type)
3. **Dice Variance** may create feel-bad moments (miss at 72% chance)
4. **Equipment Bloat** (60+ items) may overwhelm new players

### Missing Systems (Not Critical for Playtest)
1. Visual card templates (currently index cards only)
2. Physical dice manufacturing (using conversion charts for now)
3. Character sheets (tracking HP on paper)
4. Full campaign rulebook (10-mission arc)
5. 3D printable Casket models (STL files)

### Documentation Gaps
1. No visual diagrams (all ASCII/text)
2. No printable hex maps (draw by hand for now)
3. No official artwork (AI prompts provided only)
4. No quick-start video tutorial
