## QUICK START: FIRST PLAYTEST

### Step 1: Print Documents (15 minutes)
- [ ] Print [quick-reference-sheet.md](quick-reference-sheet.md) (2 copies, one per player)
- [ ] Print [arena-scenario-01-proving-grounds.md](arena-scenario-01-proving-grounds.md) (map section)
- [ ] Print [faction-deck-church-complete.md](faction-deck-church-complete.md) (deck list)
- [ ] Print [faction-deck-dwarves-complete.md](faction-deck-dwarves-complete.md) (deck list)

### Step 2: Prepare Decks (10 minutes)
Use index cards or print-and-cut cards:

**Church "Martyr's Fury" Deck (30 cards)**:
- 10 Universal Core cards
- 12 Penitent Blades (Primary Weapon)
- 6 Holy Pistol cards (Secondary Equipment)
- 2 Tactics: Righteous Fury + Crusader's Vow

### Step 3: Gather Materials
- [ ] 2d6 dice (for Strain checks)
- [ ] Tokens for Heat tracking (0-10+)

- [ ] Tokens for Rune Counters (Dwarves only)
- [ ] Component Damage markers (track Right Arm, Left Arm, Legs, Head, Chassis)
- [ ] Facing indicators (arrow tokens or dice)
- [ ] Paper for tracking HP (cards remaining in deck)

### Step 4: Setup Map
Draw or print 12×12 hex grid with terrain:
- **Forest** (8 hexes): +1 Defense when standing in them
- **Rubble** (8 hexes): +1 Defense, difficult terrain (2 SP per hex)
- **Water/Mud** (20 hexes): Difficult terrain, remove 1 Heat if end turn in Water
- **Elevation 1** (4 hexes): +1 damage from this hex, ignore cover
- **Elevation 2** (4 hexes): +2 damage, ignore cover, +1 Range

### Step 5: Deploy
- **Church**: Top-left quadrant (rows 1-3, columns 1-3)
- **Dwarves**: Bottom-right quadrant (rows 10-12, columns 10-12)
- Roll 1d6 for deployment order (higher roll chooses who deploys first)

### Step 6: Play!
Follow the turn structure:
1. **Refresh Phase**: Restore SP, check Heat Strain (if 5+ Heat)
2. **Action Phase**: Play cards, move, attack (spend SP)
3. **Draw Phase**: Draw to hand size 6, reshuffle if deck empty
4. **End Turn Phase**: Remove temporary effects

**Victory**: Reduce opponent to 0 HP OR force 4+ reshuffles

## EXPECTED GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE

### Turns 1-3: Positioning (15 minutes)
- Both players navigate terrain toward center

- Heat begins building (especially Dwarves)
- First Component Damage tracked

### Turns 7-10: Brutal Exchange (15 minutes)
- Both sides trading heavy blows
- Church using Blood Offering for burst damage
- Dwarves stacking Rune Counters
- First reshuffle likely (add 1 Damage card)
- Heat Strain checks begin (5+ Heat)

### Turns 11-15: Death Spiral (10 minutes)
- Decks contain Damage cards (dead draws)
- Component destruction occurs (3+ Component Damage)
- Players desperate, using ultimate cards
- One side collapses

**Expected Winner**: 51/49 Church favor (slightly more aggressive)

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

After playing this scenario 2-3 times, players should understand:
1. **SP economy**: When to spend, when to save, when to enter Danger Zone
2. **Heat management**: Risk/reward of high-Heat cards, Strain checks
3. **Deck cycling**: When to reshuffle, when to delay, Damage card accumulation
4. **Component damage**: Tracking, destruction effects, using Reactive cards
5. **Facing modifiers**: Importance of rear arc positioning (+2 dmg)
6. **Terrain usage**: Cover, elevation, difficult terrain costs
7. **Reactive cards**: 0 SP interrupts (Brace for Impact, Unbreakable)
8. **Death spiral**: How Damage cards cripple deck consistency

## POST-GAME DEBRIEF

After your first playtest, answer these questions:

### Game Feel
- [ ] How long did the game take? (Target: 45-60 minutes)
- [ ] Did you feel engaged throughout, or were there slow/boring moments?
- [ ] Did the game feel "brutal" (Kingdom Death-style) or too forgiving?
- [ ] Did both players have meaningful choices each turn?

### Mechanics Clarity
- [ ] Were any rules confusing or ambiguous?
- [ ] Did you have to "house rule" anything? (If so, what?)
- [ ] Were component destruction rules clear?
- [ ] Did Heat Strain checks occur? (5+ Heat)
- [ ] Did anyone reshuffle their deck? (Did Damage cards matter?)

### Balance Observations
- [ ] Did armor-piercing (Dwarven Crushing Blow) feel oppressive?
- [ ] Did Church's burst damage (Blood Offering) feel fair?
- [ ] Did 32 HP (Dwarven Stone Endurance) make them too tanky?
- [ ] Did Reactive cards (0 SP) disrupt gameplay positively or negatively?
- [ ] Which faction felt stronger? (Church or Dwarves?)

### Most/Least Useful Cards
- [ ] Which cards did you play most frequently?
- [ ] Which cards felt weak or situational?
- [ ] Did any cards feel mandatory (auto-include)?
- [ ] Did any cards feel useless (never played)?

### Suggested Changes
- [ ] What would you change about the rules?
- [ ] What would you change about the factions?
- [ ] What would you change about the scenario/map?
- [ ] What additional rules/mechanics would you add?

## NEXT STEPS AFTER PLAYTEST

### Immediate Iteration (Same Session)
1. **Swap Tactics**: Try different Tactic combinations
2. **Swap Secondary Equipment**: Church uses Tower Shield, Dwarves use Siege Cannon
3. **Add Pilot Wounds**: Include Pilot Wound Decks for full brutality
4. **Component Tracking**: Track Component Damage by specific location (not pooled)

### Future Playtests (New Sessions)
1. **Scenario #2**: Different map, different terrain, different victory conditions
2. **Third Faction**: Add Elven Verdant Covenant or The Ossuarium
3. **Campaign Mode**: Link scenarios together with pilot progression
4. **Boss Encounter**: Test Sister Vex, The Iron Saint (HP deck boss)

## DESIGN GOALS ACHIEVED

### Core Mechanics ✅
- [x] SP-based action economy (GKR-style)
- [x] Deck-as-HP (discard cards when damaged)
- [x] Component destruction (KDM-style brutality)
- [x] Heat/Strain system (risk/reward)
- [x] Facing modifiers (rear arc +2 dmg)
- [x] Reactive cards (0 SP interrupts)
- [x] Death spiral (Damage cards on reshuffle)

### Faction Asymmetry ✅
- [x] Church: Aggressive self-harm for burst damage
- [x] Dwarves: Defensive attrition with armor-piercing
- [x] Contrasting playstyles (offense vs defense)
- [x] Unique faction mechanics (Blood Offering vs Rune Counters)

### Playtest Readiness ✅
- [x] Complete rules (no "TBD" sections)
- [x] Pre-built decks (no deck construction required)
- [x] Scenario with map (ready to print)
- [x] Example of play (shows how rules work)
- [x] Quick reference sheet (table lookup)

## KNOWN ISSUES / FUTURE WORK

### Potential Balance Problems
1. **Blood Offering** may be too efficient (0 SP, +3 dmg, ignore 1 Armor)
2. **Component Destruction** may be too punishing (lose entire card type)
3. **Stone Endurance** (32 HP) may make Dwarves too tanky
4. **Armor-Piercing** may invalidate defensive builds

### Missing Systems (Not Critical for Playtest)
1. Pilot Wound Decks (optional, adds complexity)
2. Campaign progression (pilot scars, loot, settlements)
3. Boss encounters (HP deck system)
4. Additional factions (Elves, Undead, Fae, etc.)

### Documentation Gaps
1. No visual diagrams (all ASCII)
2. No printable card templates (index cards only)
3. No character sheets (track HP on paper)
4. No campaign rulebook
