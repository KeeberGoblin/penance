## Why These Were Archived

**Redundancy**: Multiple audits covered overlapping ground (contradiction checks, repository structure, version updates)

**Consolidation**: The latest audit (COMPREHENSIVE-V3-AUDIT-2025-10-14.md) provides the most current and complete picture of the repository state

**Historical Value**: These documents show the evolution of the project's quality assurance process
