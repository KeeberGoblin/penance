## Legacy Fixed-Deck System (Deprecated)

**SP Maximum**: 5 (Medium Frame - "Forge Walkers")

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**Dwarves vs Church Contrast**:
- **Church**: Aggressive, self-harm for burst damage, martyrdom
- **Dwarves**: Defensive, armor-piercing sustained damage, redundancy

**Key Mechanics**:
1. **Armor Piercing**: Ignore opponent's armor/defense buffs
2. **Rune System**: Defensive buffs that stack
3. **Component Protection**: Prevent/delay component destruction
4. **Heat Conversion**: Turn Heat into damage (forge fury)
5. **Repair**: Mid-combat HP recovery (not just cards)

## TACTICAL TIPS

### Heat Management
- Dwarves generate MORE Heat than other factions
- Use Emergency Vent and Breathe the Core frequently
- Forge Fury converts Heat → damage (emptying Heat pool)
- Forge Mastery turns Heat → card draw

### Armor Piercing Advantage
- Church relies on defense buffs (Rune Counters, Shield Wall)
- Dwarven armor-piercing attacks IGNORE all buffs
- Prioritize targets with high defense

### Rune Counter Stacking
- Rune of Protection: +1 Rune Counter per cast (max 3)
- Runic Overcharge (Tactic): +2 Rune Counters instantly
- Each counter reduces ALL damage by 1
- 3 Rune Counters = -3 damage from every attack

### Component Protection
- Unbreakable (Primary card): Prevent 1 Component Damage
- Play reactively when you discard Primary Weapon cards
- Delays component destruction

### When to Reshuffle
- Jury-Rig (Secondary C3): Prevents Damage card once
- Plan reshuffle timing around Jury-Rig availability
- Emergency Repair refills deck (delays reshuffle)

---

## COUNTER-PLAY STRATEGIES

### Playing Against Church of Absolution
**Church Strengths**: Burst damage, self-harm for buffs, martyrdom
**Dwarven Counter**:
- Stack Rune Counters early (reduces burst damage)
- Armor-piercing ignores their defensive buffs
- Outlast them in attrition (they burn through HP faster)

**Key Card**: Crushing Blow (armor-piercing shuts down their shields)

### Playing Against Elven Verdant Covenant (Hypothetical)
**Elven Strengths**: Speed, evasion, hit-and-run
**Dwarven Counter**:
- Siege Cannon catches them at range
- Earthshaker punishes clumping
- Shield Wall denies flank bonuses

**Key Card**: Earthshaker (pushes them away, creates space)

### Playing Against The Ossuarium (Hypothetical)
**Ossuarium Strengths**: Resurrection, attrition, debuffs
**Dwarven Counter**:
- Stone Endurance (32 HP) outlasts them
- Jury-Rig prevents death spiral
- Unbreakable Spirit matches their resurrection

**Key Card**: Jury-Rig (delays death spiral longer than Ossuarium)

---

## DESIGN NOTES

### Dwarven Identity
- **Defensive specialists**: Highest survivability
- **Engineering redundancy**: Component protection, repair systems
- **Armor-piercing weapons**: Ignore defenses
- **Heat economy**: High Heat generation, but converts Heat → damage/cards
- **Attrition warfare**: Win long games through sustainability

### Contrast with Church
| Aspect | Church | Dwarves |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Offense | Burst damage (self-harm) | Sustained damage (armor-piercing) |
| Defense | Reactive (Martyrdom) | Proactive (Rune Counters) |
| HP Management | Burn HP for power | Preserve HP through armor |
| Speed | High mobility | Low mobility |
| Heat | Low Heat | High Heat |
| Win Condition | Kill before dying | Outlast opponent |

### Balance Philosophy
- Dwarves trade speed for durability
- Armor-piercing is powerful but requires closing distance (or Siege Cannon)
- High Heat generation creates resource tension
- Component protection delays but doesn't prevent destruction

---

## LORE INTEGRATION

### Forge Walkers
The Dwarven Clans call their Caskets "Forge Walkers" - mobile forges that carry the heat of the mountain deeps. Each pilot is a Master Smith, bound to their creation through neural threads forged in their own blood.

### Runic System
Dwarven runes are not decoration. They are living programs carved in Soulstone, storing defensive algorithms that activate when struck. Each Rune Counter represents a layer of protective magic burning away.

### Heat as Heritage
Where other factions fear Heat, Dwarves embrace it. Their capsules are saunas, their controls searing hot. They breathe superheated air and call it home. Forge Fury is not a technique—it's their birthright.

### Component Protection Philosophy
"Steel bends. It does not break." Every Forge Walker has redundant systems, backup hydraulics, emergency coolants. When a Church Casket loses an arm, it's gone. When a Dwarf loses an arm, three backup systems activate. They don't die easy.

---

## PLAYTEST NOTES

### Strengths Observed
- 32 HP build (Stone Endurance) is incredibly tanky
- Armor-piercing shuts down defense-heavy opponents
- Heat conversion creates interesting decision points

### Weaknesses Observed
- Low mobility makes positioning difficult
- High Heat generation requires constant management
- Struggles against ranged kiting strategies

### Balance Adjustments Needed
- Consider reducing Siege Cannon Heat costs (-1 per shot)
- May need to cap Rune Counters at 2 instead of 3 (too much damage reduction?)
- Unbreakable Spirit may be too powerful (free resurrection)

### Player Feedback Requested
1. Does armor-piercing feel oppressive against defensive factions?
2. Is 32 HP (Stone Endurance) too much survivability?
3. Does Heat management feel like interesting choices or tedious bookkeeping?
