                        <p>"This is Dr. Nikolas Theslar, Head of Resonance Studies at the Sibarian Institute. If you're hearing this, the test has failed. The Engine was supposed to eliminate scarcity. Unlimited energy. Post-death consciousness transfer. Immortality for all. Instead, it's... singing. God help us. It's singing, and I can't stop listening."</p>
                        <p>The last words from the Sibarian Institute before the Sundering. The Resonance Engine activated at 14:22 GMT. By 14:23, the world had ended.</p>

                        <p>"We found Marissa three days after she died. Frost took her in the night. But when we went to bury her, she was gone. We heard something walking in the snow. Heavy. Mechanical. It was her, but not her. She'd built herself a body out of scrap metal and frozen corpses. She didn't speak. Just pointed north and started walking."</p>
                        <p>The first documented case of post-mortem consciousness persistence. The phenomenon was named "Remnant Animation." Later, it would simply be called "The Curse."</p>

                        <p>"We did not die because we were unworthy. We died because the world demanded sacrifice. Now, bound to these iron shells, we are given a second chance. Not to live, but to atone. Every enemy felled is a sin purged. Every mission completed is a step toward salvation. We will earn our rest through violence, or we will walk this broken world forever."</p>
                        <p>The Church's ideology spread rapidly among the Remnants. Within a generation, they controlled three major city-states and declared Absolution their divine mandate.</p>

They report hearing the Engine's song, even hundreds of miles from Sibaria. Stage 3 Taint victims exhibit reality distortion fields. Stage 5... they become something else. We have no cure.

                        <p>"The Church split today. Not over theology, but methodology. Cardinal Vross proclaimed that only human Remnants deserve salvation. Archbishop Kael argued that all who suffer can be redeemed. The vote was close. Vross won. By morning, half the Church had seceded, forming the Covenant of Broken Chains. They welcomed the elves, the mutants, the forgotten. The Church Militant declared them heretics. The civil war lasted 80 years."</p>

Pre-Casket war machine, massive beyond comprehension. 40 meters tall, fusion core still active after two centuries. Forgemaster Durr insisted we could control it. He was wrong. It activated, killed 60 miners, then went dormant again. Durr claimed it spoke to him. Said it was 'waiting for the right war.' We sealed the quarry. Durr still goes down there. Alone. He's been going for 240 years."</p>

                        <p>The Church promises redemption through violence. The Elves tend their dying forests. The Dwarves build ever more complex solutions to unsolvable problems.

                        <p>None remember what peace felt like. None remember what it meant to be truly alive. There is only the weight of centuries, the grinding of iron against iron, and the faint hope that maybe, just maybe, the next kill will be the one that finally brings rest.</p>
